The Republican Party Strategy against Obama’s Re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy of the necessity of fighting election fraud.
Brennan's centre, however, refers to such fraud as a myth that the election fraud is less frequent in the USA than the number of people who die after the blossom.
In the past ten years, the Republican attorneys recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US is responsible for the organisation of the federal elections of individual states.
And in this spirit, most of the American governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make the election process difficult or write into the election list.
This phenomenon was recorded after elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, only 180 proposals were submitted for 2011 in 41 countries.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and documentary on American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the pre-decession election period, abolish the right to enter the voter's list on the day of the elections and defer the right of election to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006, no American State required the voters to provide evidence of identity with photographs.
The first state that introduced this request was Indiana.
The constitution of the Indian law confirmed the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other countries.
For the last two years, they supported the draft laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photographs IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as medical insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age allowing to vote, no identification of photographs issued by the government of their state.
In addition, there is no such identity of about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the requested identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low income.
25% African-Americans, 15% of persons with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens older 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore have no desired photo identification.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their accent to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
By 2004, no State required a document of citizenship for elections.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, about 12 states have adopted laws which lay down the obligation of voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It must be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer democratic parties.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported the laws in eight states that abolish the entry of voters on the day of the elections.
They also limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigns helped to register around 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the recording of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then in the next five states adopted laws aiming at shortening the preschool elections.
For example, during the general elections in 2008, in Florida, African Americans formed 33% of voters who voted in advance, even though only 13% of African voters in the state were.
It was the same in Hispanics.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the prestigious citizens.
On the other hand, the white people who represented 76% of all voters were only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, against the approval of the laws restricting the registration of voters, democratic legislatures and their supporters have been strongly built.
Democracy governors have blocked several laws from their veto.
To suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the Prosecutor-General of the United States even intervened.
They managed to reduce the damage in part.
For example, the laws requiring a photo identification card only adopted 16 out of 34 states.
However, the new rules put in place will make the exercise of the voting law completely unfamiliar in 2012.
Democracy criticisms mainly refer to the pre-connection of approved laws and consider them apparent to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states.
The 2011 Brennan's report shows that the countries in which these laws have been approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the congregation of voters necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare, with certainty, that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
However, one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Discovering prostate cancer: to perform exams or not?
The PSA test brought wrong results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical treatments.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have already been so heated to go.
To investigate or not?
We asked for an opinion by two experts.
In the US studies, a high level of contamination has been shown between the groups tested, it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time, has identified a different mortality between patients who have undergone an examination and those who have not gone to them.
This study has also demonstrated after 12 years of withdrawal that those who do not carry out tests have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
I therefore recommend testing from 50 years of age or 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
The men of African-American origin are also more vulnerable.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are inadvertent.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of hazard of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active surveillance of diseases in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them to life.
We suggest that they carry out active surveillance, and in the case of progression, we offer them treatment.
We are still more often and more accurately setting criteria that help in deciding which kind of treat and which are not.
However, I recommend the examinations to be completed.
It is important, however, to interview a doctor and to determine whether an examination is appropriate or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember Movember movement created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, the best means to reduce the risk of diseases to adopt principles of healthy lifestyles seems to be.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and move enough, it would be possible to avoid up to 30% of cancer cases.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would rise at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, the speaker of the Canadian cancer research company.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentage remains also completely unexplained.
For a Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers falls.
Cigarettes are 85% of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There's 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Reinforcing data: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death decreases by half.
Weight
Body and obesity are another risk factors for the occurrence of disease according to SCC.
It increases the risk of breast cancer, fatty intestines and finality, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the fatty intestine," says the report.
Nutrition
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid seeds for which the same applies.
Conservation of meat by drying, drying or salting may lead to carcinogenics.
"They can cause damage to the organism's cells and lead to cancer development," says the report.
Vitamins
Many scientists have recently focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet made clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to SCC.
Although, according to one of them, the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, other studies talk more about its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu insists on how important it is to talk about his fears and family precedents with his doctor.
"The test doesn't mean you have cancer."
Higgs Boson examined
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs Boson caused a legitimate start last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all material in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or the "minimum bad" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the material - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no 100% certainty among physics that it is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to Higgs' boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large physics congress in Kyoto are more confirmed, but there are still no information that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that it's Higgs' boson, as the risk of misleading appears to be small, and let's see what it is.
In this world, the law is incredibly questionable, according to which two things cannot occur in the same moment in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it appears that there is a similar law: Pauli's excretion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "figure" is actually forming some of their properties.
In addition, the physics particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find all sorted citizens, or fermins, who obey Pauli's principle.
And at the second end, the bosons are moving, the anarchists who do not respect anything - are certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the facility (the way of absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesones that we leave here without notice, and the "silent particles", which spread great natural forces and with which Higgs' boson is probably somehow related.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals as possible.
If you read this article, it's thanks to the boson with unusual banality: photon, or "the part of the light", which is "the carrier" of electromagnetic forces.
For when the particles with an electric charge speed up or change their direction, the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the clouds put into a pond.
From this "distortion" the electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than photon - and therefore one of the bosons, "power carriers".
Stabilised fields
Also, it's with Higgs' boson, just the difference that "distorted" is another field, Higgs' field to show up.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for its excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, just like the frozen pond level, which is already staring only a very large balloon.
For this reason, the massive accelerator of part must be used as a fastener in the CERN lab - a large hadron accelerator with a treadmill is a ring with a circuit of 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
Analogy with electromagnetic field is once again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and Matter.
With electromagnetic field, they don't react to any particles or any material.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to itself on the refrigerator.
And it still applies that they do not react with the Higgs field all particles: those that do so have a particular matter, while others (such as photon, look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Nováková asks what all these research are for, what will they bring to us?
For science, it is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physics to examine any mismatch between SM observations and forecasts.
In addition, few physicists literally wish to find them, because the smallest difference could open the space of "new physics" and fill some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has so far huge deficiencies, does not provide any clarification of gravity (aha!) or dark matter, which constitutes approximately 80% of the space material (awe!).
However, the CERN device has not yet revealed such discrepancies.
Responses
The responses of these research in the daily life of Mr and Mrs. Novák can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no one.
See: at the very beginning of the '60s, the pioneers had no laser in Bell's laboratories or no idea of the revolution, already inducing their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "laboratory play".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can come out of all the instruments that cover research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as a "round" of all digital cameras in the world and gave him Nobel's prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but that means that you really don't know...
Fuel care - The best way to get out of life... Le Devoir
By means of its Commission for the dignified dying of Quebec, he recently intervened in a delicate question concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue soon and at the same time a draft of the law is being put forward.
There is still a lot of work to do in this crucial area.
Le Devoir’s magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating it gave him a two-year postponement.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for pale-care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has accomplished its work: the immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or to eat alone.
He's remarkably looking at a tasteful breakfast and agreeing to help him eat.
He's brave, and even smiles, talks to the unsubs who stop at him, brings his medicine, offer his bath.
The courage to normal death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, he humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure on his problem.
"In life, a man learns that men urinate stands," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Going back to the child's phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the man," whether he accepts the return, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people who are involved in paliative care, major moments are taking place in the core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with paliative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer from all cancers.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care about them does not provide so-called "medication" care.
In the case of Mrs. A, 89 years, the worst fear is to die "to suffocate in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life," he says, and then he'll call on us to put on her a breathing device.
Still, it is still looking forward to the last visit of the son from Italy in the following days.
At home Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides body care with the help of nutrition.
That's how pale care comes in if there's nothing else you can do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québeku, one pale-care bed appears to be of 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die once.
Here life continues in optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you can give him a taste of brandy or pepsi, for example.
Diabetic should no longer be monitored for sugar levels.
And death here is part of everyday life.
They carried Mr. X's beer last night, who died later at night.
He'll finish his son's beer this morning to honor his father's deceased.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, Director of the Care Services.
In the home, Victor-Gadbois goes one by one, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 30-year-old man who rejoices from the last meeting with his family thoroughly founded on the pillows, while drinking to his honor, dies tragically a six-four-year-old man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after he tried all the possibilities to survive.
"There are always three to five beds for people with cancer within 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to pale treatment, i.e. care, which is intended to mitigate suffering as soon as they grow up to the final phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the care house.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Company for home paleative treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more exclusively on the care provided to cancer patients.
And this essential lack of medical care in Quebek leads to a number of doctors specializing in paliatic care fears the adoption of the Eutanazia Act and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifest has been signed with the tips in the field of paliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they argue disagreement with such initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the quebian health system is not sufficiently effective to ensure that all persons are accessed to quality paliative care before they can agree to the implementation of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency in huge pain, without making any necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients do not ask for death because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the negative forecast.
The hope of survival of Hélène Richard was already quite minimal when she left a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was done with treatment, she replied that she felt sorry for me to stop fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no vast care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thank their nurses for not fulfilling their wishes when their paliative cunts relieved their pain.
However, it is important to say that paliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, directors for palliative care at the Grand Montréal Company, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use paliative sedatives, which will sleep the patient until the moment of the horse, whether or not the sedatives are administered permanently.
We cannot face that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient that we can't get rid of the pain will have a greater possibility of access to paliative sedatives.
The sick, which is not provided with sedative, always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanazia," it means "I want you to get me out of pain."
The implementation of this report allowed a grant to journalists from the Canadian Health Research Institute.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel Administration officials, Construction and Public Works entrepreneurs, lobby political parties and experts in the Italian Mafia continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which they mix construction, state officials, politicians, professionals and mafia.
This "bor" came quebecké taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has been dispersed since we have taken fundamental measures," says the ironically Jacques Duchesneau, the quebian Member and former police chief in Montreal.
It led to a scandal in 2011 on the basis of a consistent investigation aimed at misleading resources in connection with the agreements for the construction of roads in Quebek, which was approved by the former liberal premiere ofquest Jean Charest after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct link between industry, the impartial financing of the parties and the corruption of state officials.
"From the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport spared a billion dollars on contracts," when some people kept their instincts on the ground to gain a share on them!
Charbonneau's committee "who brings two mayors to demission," adds with the hope that she will "discover the rage of some people."
Standing Unit for Combating Corruption based in 2011
The Standing Unit for Combating Corruption established in 2011 is also involved in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To that end, police officers of "Marteau's types" who have ensured that the montreal "food cartel" significantly mitigated the inflammation of contracts...
In the last few weeks, they have carried out a number of tours and accused many of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one town in the suburb.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He's suspected that he repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges were also received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused sensation by explaining the Commission's public procurement mechanism.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montréal to the mafia intermediary that then transferred the money to Union Montréal for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
After 2000, he was rich in all parties and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68,000) to the province parties, but in particular to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he organized illegal financing for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Orders with moneylines whose prices were overwhelming
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described it very detailed in front of the committee: in ten years he received gifts from the construction companies, invitation to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pockets worth a total of $736,000 exchanged for contracts with money ducts, at which he overestimated the price.
Other public agents from the transport sector admitted that they had paid their rewards for 30% to 40% overvalued invoices through false multi-works.
The Mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of having his eyes caught on the concurrent budget that brought dirty money to his post office.
Based on these discoverys, Tremblay resigned in the beginning of November, which led Montréal to a large crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members who issued a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, it has been committed against the sale of the land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters directly in the middle of a growing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says, "he's pulling strings in trying to understand the functioning of the system of an ants to stop the gangrene and grab the guilts."
The process says it's painful, but positive.
We are at the stage of cleaning the wound, but we need to set up our own investigative unit in Montréal and ensure that these doubtful practices cannot return.
Like cleaning up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public agents have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he fears in particular the role of the "people informed about this gut", unless they are wet in these cheeks!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony he adds: "I heard it was just a weak odvar of reality."
The Quebean Government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, but that is not what he believes: "If there is strict limitation of election expenses, the dirty money will not disappear from the policy."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and funding of parties: "We can no longer fall; if we focus courageously on the essence of things, we can again build on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story engraved Quebeka and Montreal's painting abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who's laughing at him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you and PSG set a completely new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals in each other or by a completely new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day I get along with them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in the fights.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
Since my beginnings in the InF Clairefontaine preparatory, I've always moved to Saint-Etienne for a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The missions from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me has a bigger taste in the game and wants to give maximum performance.
And Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who played at the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got great experience, and he's got a lot of titles with the top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I graduated from a calming conversation with him.
I've had a number of injuries.
The confidence he provides to me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our front position.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we are very easy to go to eightfinals.
What's your club's target in this competition?
We'll try as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the quality of European teams.
We want to first win our qualification group in front of Port so that we can play the retaliation of eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a large European club in the short term?
The budget's got...
In order to become a great European club, Paris must win titles and sign up in history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, the PSG has the means to succeed in doing this.
And would there be great failure not to win in the 1st league as last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We've missed a lot last year.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had even more amazing season.
I think it's gonna work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media are expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us because of what's invested here and what players we have.
That's totally acceptable.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home, and there's still something they're upsetting us in the paper, it's not very pleasant.
People ask what more people might want from you.
Of course, it's not to win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build the team.
In Liza, we've proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought the second season until the eight-finals, but they've also invested great amounts!
In view of the investment sums you could expect to have 15 points ahead of the others!
That insults other clubs and French leagues.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not succeed in the last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulty we managed to win.
It seems like PSG relies in everything on the performances of the Golden Ibrahimovich.
It's good that they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
That means Ibrahimovich is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves she's the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he showed that he was a big player, a world star.
We respect the man and the players in our team.
Even he respects the people he's got around.
What he's accomplished is really special.
This also led others to increasing their own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, which belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French representation?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I imagined it.
But I've seen it, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I'm good at playing good games.
And that's what I've been hoping for since my entry into the representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to our performance exemplary.
How do you look at Didier Deschamps' first months in the head of the National Team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good place in the qualifications for MS.
Coach chooses strictly, is close to the players, and he can exaggerate for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc reached its goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We were all fighting for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never seen such a fight for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as it is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political view: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopoly leads to financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudo) represents both virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euro...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
With 15,000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin course first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is about $10 (the overview of courses is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money," "competitive dollar and euro" and "day-of-the-day money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the video game procedure that you get by or can buy (and leckdy and rechange).
The social network of Facebook also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processs individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network depositors are books of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses using an e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The file of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed by a encryption system with a double key.
Thus, the network may verify the legality of the transaction.
The content of the file can also be ensured that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of common accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in the recording of this new transaction into this book.
It is through addressing the mathematical task of the computers identified by a solver of a temporary central banker, who will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a file cutting phase; i.e. the transformation of a huge file to shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, and then they'll cut off the whole thing.
The aim is to find a number that provides a specific print (a good zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the rest of the knots will easily check its correctness.
The transaction shall then be displayed inadmissiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would have been made to change the print.
If the user wishes to pay twice the same money very quickly (up to 10 minutes), the network confirms only one of both transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to the number of 21 million, but they can be divided to a hundredmillionth, so the margin area is here...
The difficulty given to the task is also increasing with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and falls.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and there has been a deterrence of stored bitcoins.
"The used skull does not relate to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, founded by Paymium, a company for payment of real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of laundering dirty money thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Significant players as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this character.
Others, as a platform of WordPress blogs, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of Weizmann's Institute in Israel have recently analysed the book of current accounts and demonstrated that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not involved.
In November, "Great Discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, dealing with the transformation of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching book on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (the real money) or a direct mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper thanks to it.
In addition, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for traders where no new terminals or software is needed.
Just tell you the address that can be "octographed and recognized" by your phone, explains Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin sits down, it will take a while, but 2013 might be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB expects a re-evaluation of the different risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The greatest injury suffered by the people in the Afghan country we punished since we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, for we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those injuries and mutilations.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan but often are rural people who reject foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists joined them, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiki.
They are now experiencing tolerances and often helping local rebels, but if Western forces fall down, their support will fall.
The exit of the French forces from the Nijrab foundation, which I followed from the peaks of the mountains planted with mandlons thanks to the French loans, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Cabul without attacking the air coach.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed significantly.
Cabul was empty at the time, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fights between the various resistance groups.
Their taking over the country was then considered to be their kind of exemption, returning to security.
However, the Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these rural areas, which had completely controlled the Al-Ká'id organization, did not improve their situation until our time.
Some of the Mushani, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to maintain women in a subordinate position.
The main judges from the war against the Soviet Units returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmakers, empowered state lands sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were neither in the fight.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people want a government that doesn't create thieves.
Many young people want to leave like those who have managed to use American generosity: capital leak is significant.
The young are already tired of war and associated with it with ideology.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was recognized and its advantages were taken into consideration.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five hundred total populations.
The towns are full of state schools, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to provide work, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will face her forehead be considered legitimate?
Somewhere leaders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewed by provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a horn country with a strong impact of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation after the model of the Western States, but the US wanted to convert it to a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of the Prime Minister has been cancelled since the Constitution was adopted in 1964.
The President of Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular not on the occasion of elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been significantly dependent on foreign assistance since the past 50s and earlier years.
No industry has failed to restore, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is modified.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, just fruit and vegetables.
Prime Minister has a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, governmental inspection of infrastructure would be necessary.
The rumors have spread that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that just made the feeling that the western states were only here to strengthen it.
Without energy for the processing of iron or copper on the spot and without means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, however, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the mine on the copper of Mes Aynak and left the international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore a wide Buddhist area to maintain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on the large part of imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The exit of the French battle forces was completed on November 20th.
The new Cooperation Treaty foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boy lycea, French cathedrals at universities, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support of archaeological delegations.
Since 2009, the initiative "to acquire a heart and soul" attempted to align aid and military activities, in which the "citizen-arms" ministry (Cimic), which was repealed in 2012, was achieved by a countless French non-governmental organisation of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
These work, involving the number of local workers, helped to suppress the rises: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of cultivable areas.
What memory will we leave for two billion euros of military expenses?
A lot more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often found at an altitude above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order for these farmers to free themselves from the uprising of foreign groups, they wish to, according to their words, to achieve a slight civil assistance in their behalf, which would be properly controlled and touched directly.
Hard work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí has launched another poker party.
While Egypt remained most divided in his history because of the publication of a constitution that temporarily gives him unlimited powers, he decided to play a bank.
On Wednesday, he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text as soon as possible.
A few months ago, the Head of State of the Assembly granted the next two months to complete the work needed.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provizor text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal contempts.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the division of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president continues in his "autocratic deliria", continues to "destruct his word" and "whispers the law".
However, its supporters ensure that it is the means to reverse as quickly as possible with constitutional and political crises and accelerate the transitional process.
In two weeks, a referendum should be held.
It is a very short time section that will make Brotherhood step away from the intention of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
For the President, it is also a way to reap the national and democratic legitimacy while the entire country rejects protests.
As he confirmed in the talk for the American Time Weekend, Muhammad Mursí seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this quick-organized vote builds the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You will approve my text, or I will keep unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of the Constitutional Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals missed the vote.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitution, they knocked the doors, and they didn't have the opportunity to share their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or religious minorities have imitated their step.
To achieve the easeability, 11 persons from a series of alternates were quickly supplemented yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It will not be surprising that the articles of the Constitution have often been voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to argue that one of the few disputes was spinning around that day... hours for prayer when some of the Committee members considered that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted about last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains finally consistent with the 1971 Constitution version and provides that "the rules of chariot rights are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped that they would replace the term "the principle" with the term "the rule", which would allow stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Pocriticalism" suggests liberals who see only a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role to the University of al-Azhar, in particular on matters of compliance with the law of the Chariot.
According to an expert at Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people authorized to express are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen in the beginnings of the theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are even more depressed by the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the existing one.
"Now there has been no specific religious consequences.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civilian state of frame.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamists, but university workers, many of them graduated in French schools," the mild concerns Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
They agree, however, that "the differences in the interpretation of Article 220 can exist, as the term used in it belongs to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science, notably Red.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civilian judges are competent to express it."
Yesterday, the approved text is highly criticized, besides religious sites, because of the extended powers which it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that their remarkable restrictions have occurred against the former regime.
Another disputed position: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the will of the military leaders, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Board.
Furthermore, civilians will not be banned in military courts as required by the human rights protection associations.
These associations speak about their doubts in connection with the text they believe to be against freedom.
The criminal detention act is maintained and the insult is still prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with women's protection, Heba Morayef emphasises the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to perform in a television speech last night, manifestations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Then the heads of the state will be manifested on Saturday.
In Israel awaits the Ukrainian tourists the sacred places, the puppy of the world and the sea from the saturated salt solution
The promised earth combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and naturelessness.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverend to the Holy Place
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all who enter this "lain" will come down to God’s mercy.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the transformation of water in wine at the wedding, walking down the water, calming down the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and to resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers are going through the path of pain, or Jesus ’ Cross route (latinsky Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the court took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's grave on Golgota mountain - to the place of crucification, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian puppe of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, the tree from which they made a cross to Jesus ’ crucification.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the wall of screams, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different religions are leaving notes with wishes that will then be completed.
Enforce the way through the vertical
The ruin of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding from the enemy that Herodes the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruin is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in climbing can reach it with their own strengths.
The others to this historic mountain will be driven by cable.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is a famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge flow of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists are transported from the foot of the hills by a shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit everyone in one way.
But at least five of them, the most interesting one, definitely worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (parlament).
In it are stored ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in Judean desert caves, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art is also worth visiting in Tel-Aviv.
In his exposure, their canvas are widely represented by impressionists and expresionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In the Akkono you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which represents several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with mannequins of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesar is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There's no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
Fifth Museum - Museum of Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on a monument of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You'll come in, and you'll be in complete darkness.
The stars are shrinking.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
It also introduces Ukraine.
Enhancing your health
Three main spa centres of Israel are spread on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, ashtrays, dolphinaria and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can also be bathed in winter months because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Celsia and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and there are people swimming all year round.
The dead sea is, by the way, the strangest sea in the world, located in the lowest landing point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that is easily maintained on both levels and people who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with saltwater - salt water, and medicinal mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, echromy, arthritis, inflammation of the mouth, diabetes to cure the sweated nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by an ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them there was a famous sailing trip connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotama.
The mention of this city is located in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it's a place where Noah built his arch and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived here together a long and happy life.
Indeed, the tourists love toasts with the vultures of the streets named after the signs of the beast.
They say that if you stick to the walls in the alley of your "should" sign, happiness will be favorably adhered to you.
In Jaffa you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesar - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "good" fortress of the cruisers.
In the Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the headquarters of Roman Prosecutors, including Pilate Pontsky.
Carefully reconstructed theatre is used for evening concerts and opera performances today.
Tourists, for a word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country it speaks about 30% of the Russian population.
It is better to take money on the road, not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 cheques).
Municipal transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city with the top.
It's basically the underground rope track.
Traveling all kinds of public transport costs 6 checklists for which you can take 1.5 hours at the time of driving.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, it stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork meat, seafood, fish without hams and meals in which the combination of milk and meat are included.
They offer a large selection of foods from lamb and beef, soups and desserts prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish dush of hummus, various types of sauces, minced grain balls - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stubborn dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
So there are very many fed cats that are gracefully "touch according to their taste".
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The forwarding cats love the populated places and they like to go to every goodness.
Car rental will be from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bicycle will cost about 15 cheques a day.
The museum tickets are on average 30 cheques.
Numbers expressed in
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Acknowledge the country and rest most US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine arrived.
The promised Earth visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will announce it to Moscow: the emigrants will save money for the language
While Members and human rights guards are still debating the law on mandatory language tests, there are already frauds in the country who are selling "paid" certificates.
There are 13 million foreign workers every year in Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turques.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law has entered into force, according to which each working migrant will be required to test the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be required for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also from Russian history and from the foundations of law.
Language knowledge will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a official language.
This law is not subject to even the people who successfully managed to achieve the accreditation and to obtain a academic diploma to the disintegration of the SSSR in 1991.
Benefit, conviction and protection of rights
The network of trial sites will work under the auspices of Puškin's Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship among the nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petrohrad and other Russian universities.
Migrants can test in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the implementation of the testing has also supported the Members of State Dumy and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law entered into force, the human rights guardians could ask a number of times in the press: what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and the visitors themselves?
Firstly, this will reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "faithful work."
Many people today talk about the protection of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the Board of Directors of the FMS Russia in Tadžikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
The only system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in immigrants without occupation, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says with the belief of Sebelev - a future migrant is condemned to conflicts with unfair people who will provide him with a "disciplinary" in terrible, tight accommodations, in which he and dozens of others, like him himself, spend months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homes they promise one, but after their arrival they will be cheated, confiscating their passports, not paying the promised wages," confirms the Heads of the Tadžic Working Migration of MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't pass!
Less than that, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic, who intend to go to Russia's work, recognise that they not only know the language of the country they want to reach, but have no experience even with the work they have.
Of course, it is not their fault as much as their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford at least adequate basic education.
Their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, dressed and furnished into school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they have to be educated in the first place.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliated and less valuable."
It is true that, in view of the law on language tests, human rights protectors point to one important thing.
Testing will only take place in those migrants who are legal.
If they don't have it, they won't even have any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live illegally as before in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Staff of the Russian police know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"They require hundreds, two for cigarettes, tea," said the journalists about his experience, the citizen of Tadžikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be lame, buy a painting."
In the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that false documents not only of the registration migrants are available.
Personnels of FMS have already held several false certificates of language examination.
False documents are printed on ordinary colour printeres.
Of course, the new owners were not free of charge: every migrant in the hope that he would make it easier for the trials, he paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times higher than the official test: that's going to cost migrating workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure the system from corruption so that the workers cannot simply buy documents, thereby the government officials and human rights guards agree.
The governments can, for the time being, promise foreign workers who did not manage the tests for the first time, a time needed to graduate the course of the foundation of the Russian language.
Work in areas where active dealing with humans is not required for visitors who do not speak Russianly.
MVD (Ministership of the Interior) does not take the illegal market for weapons into circulation
The proportion of criminal offences using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to civilian weapons owners.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the inspiration was the cases of shooting at weddings that had gone without the victim, and the massacre prepared by Mosque lawyer Dimitrij Vinogradov, which resulted in seven people died.
The police want to prohibit the wear of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which they can get a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea supports the head of the Dummy Committee for Security and the fight against corruption of Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the changes in the Law on Arms will be submitted to the State Dummies in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem on the way the screws are pulling.
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors, representatives of various social shooting organisations, demand that the law be rejected by "independent tightening".
The percentage of holiganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared Vasilij Lesnikov, lawyer and criminal in interview with the Russian editorial of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed in six months of 2012 using guns registered by the Ministry of Interior, while 1168,000 crimes were committed during the same period.
Authors of the open letter are convinced, tightening up civilian weapons legislation does not force the perpetrator to enter the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon at low price can be found in Moscow at present.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" market with weapons is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says the colonel at Victor Baran, who worked for ten years at the Department of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept weapons orders
First of them - "armway or military", that means the weapon that was stolen during the fights on the Caucasus.
"The guns were stolen by the Russian officers and the lonely Caucasians," says Barananiec.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals in security forces.
The Baracon explains that there are also thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the authorities in criminal proceedings.
The illegal "mainly" is being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses there are often explosions.
"It is proven that some fires were set intentionally - to cover the mancake so," said the former soldier.
According to Barance's words, they bring their contribution to weapons manufacturers.
"Private armory companies, which are not competitive on the international market, are currently erasing weapons that supply to the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
Especially the number of guns and machines comes from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and a mafia that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have read the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue has been drafted in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Public Administration.
The specialists discussed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the Crimean Literature and the public data portals focused on weapons.
The major majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons appeared on the black market, "the blame of official agents whose work is connected with weapons," says the report.
According to the data available by researchers, 17% of weapons from armed conflicts are found, in 14% of cases of theft of weapons in their production, 5% are "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores that asked us not to give his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeology" are no longer buying - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers ride for new consignments directly to military warehouses.
Over the battalion, the applicant buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
You order a gun with him, and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He'll take it to the city and sell it for 900 euros per piece with two tanks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the painting, and that's why whenever they start to burn a plan in clarification of crimes, they'll do a check-up with illegal weapons dealers," says the counsellor.
"Such as in a luxury store."
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their friends.
I visited the website and blogs until the guy who offered me the opportunity to move to the "Talk Testing" platform, where a man who would lead me to a "home" where we're going to act together.
The price was the most important thing that I learned.
Military rapporteur, Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out tells the seller - the counselor. - I have a friend like this, but I don't trust him in full.
The salesmen on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to make sure that my daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He'll give them to me, too, because he knows I won't.
The beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he worked for the publication of this topic.
The chart didn't change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album where it was "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," he recalls a soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of the Lamb, does not offer rabbits in the bag - you can try everything.
I, potential client, I just don't buy-- we're going to the forest salesman and build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and if I convince myself that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," describes the expert's procedure.
Sofa storage unit
The search engines will bring you to the websites and groups on the "Contend", where you can buy weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a fixed amount of money," writes in a commercial title on the website "To buy a fight gun or a machine."
On this site users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale of a minor?
"Of course without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the version is maintained).
"I'm buying TT.Moskva" - it briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently set up a huge network of web sites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can collect a shovel.
People go down like hungry fish on bait and then get coal in Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Higher Military Admiral Viktor Baraněc
I've heard about these diagrams:web sites are usually registered within the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer will make a payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," says the spokesman of the non-governmental organization "Pravo na zbraň" Dmitrij Kislov.
Viktor Baranniec confirms that after ordering on the website you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently set up a huge network of web sites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can collect a shovel.
"People are grooming like hungry fish on bait and then receiving coal in Siberia," confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, you will pay the amount normally from 100 to 900 dollars according to the estimate of experts.
According to Dmitri Kisl's non-governmental organization, you will get a Macarov gun for $100 to $300.
You must wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon shall be expedited from warehouses to long-term storage through medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official statistical authority, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to January 2011, and was 22.9,000 cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and blackmailing of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fastfood workers and supermarkets strike
Work on the cash office of "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, the wave of protests against low wombs in the hypermarkets of Walmart and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave turns into a wave of nine, or whether it is meant to disappear soon.
The entire share is supported by unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries received by numerous workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, the aim of the protest organisers is to achieve the creation in their trade unions.
Today, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after the Thanksgiving Day, in a so-called "black Friday", when America hit an orgy of cheap sales, captured millions of people, and in some cases it was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some of the workers of Walmart, in which he is working on 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplace and demonstrated together with unions and left-hand activists of transnational trade chains, whose goods are intended for people from lower and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers through the hunting rifles and car battery to the vacuum cleaner, eggs and milk.
The products in his sales are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only at work.
The availability and range of goods made from the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because only few pay their employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions such as lack of automatic carts or manual scanners.
The demonstrants called for "black Friday" to increase their salaries and complained that the costs of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 per hour, but that doesn't correspond to the amount of expenditure, says employees.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases average wages to $12 per hour, it will cost $3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages fully to the consumer's shoulders, each visit in the store will be only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about 12.39 dollars more than today.
The defenders of Walmart point out that the protest was only in nine countries and the company should not cause practical damage.
"Black Friday" in sales companies lasted from 8 hours on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, her cashes made almost 100 million transactions on the black Friday.
Dan Fogelman said in an interview for Huffington Post's left jobs a total of less than five employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all over "there media sensation" organised by the unions.
"The unsettled cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goals were not the Walmart business houses (these progressive cities are not very popular, and therefore almost there are not), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of porcelain, and then he doesn't even pay you a sickness, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
At present, the minimum wages for work in accordance with federal law and the New York State regulations are $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants increase this wage gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive $8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower wage in this expensive town.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Working at "McDonald" will pass almost a quarter of American teenagers who work after school in part-time and live with their parents.
Only few people see their main source of nutrition or plan to stay there for a long time.
At the moment I'm constantly meeting in a conversation with the workers of "McDonald", who complain that they have to live out of these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, Wall Street Journal owes a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants of protests that began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the Treasury and chefs in high-speed facilities start getting at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the swift food sector.
American law prohibits the administration of the establishment of union organisations and punish the activists of the trade movement by bullying and release.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
However, the establishment of a rapid refreshment of the union is complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is an unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Dismissed
On this day, loud protests also took place in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The event was culminated at the "McDonalda" meeting near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians appeared, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of porcelain, and then he doesn't pay you well for your honest work!"
Demonstrants were also awaiting support for other prominent New York Democrats, such as the Mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we have to go together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, as each New Yorker deserves!"
As New York Times described it, it was the biggest event of his kind in the history of the American sphere of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved in it, even though not all of them were fast food workers that employ dozens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark that lights the flame of the mass movement, it is yet unclear.
"So far, the brain is going to be deceived on average."
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology is popular topic of extended reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially through fries of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented the working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also submitted an application for the relevant patent.
The interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that the glasses are already past for the scientists of this company.
It is tempted by the perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with hollow hands, creating virtual public space.
- Please tell us a frame, what's your research group doing?
- We're dealing with the interactions of a man with a machine, but at the same time we're trying to move the border of this interaction.
Humanity has yet been stuck in a stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touches the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is today for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all, it is a very interesting option to control using a gesture.
- What else do we have in the future?
- Notwithstanding that the Kinect system has transferred interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of the information has been improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow is not specially yet.
We're trying to change it, working on a truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including designers.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the area around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all - to hell with the stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it surprising?
Surely he can't be regarded as all-advertent - it raises a question of privacy, because we don't always want to inform others about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling the facilities in public places, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not the disgusting, just such smashed, short.
At the same time, the gesture would not eat the camera with the device, but the bracelet that would monitor the movement of bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watch.
However, it is generally true that the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
So you're going to get the user to adapt to what it can or can't the machine at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a reciprocal relationship.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can find human reactions more accurately.
This can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, that is very important.
If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can depart from in our work for a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels itself, but like matrix and depth.
In the present view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this entails the work of algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axis, but also the Z.
So the speed is also very important, the number of shots per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows 30 images per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serum-producing sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a man with a machine.
For me, it would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some more pictures in a second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- In the Kinect system, three cameras are now used, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - receiver of a boomed signal.
And already the third camera-- that's actually a common visual band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system of Kinect, play with the curved location of the cameras and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall well, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think it's one of the most promising platforms in terms of the daily use of the technology of extended reality?
- Of course walking and constantly holding smatphone in lifted hands isn't very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transmitable" like the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection screen and around.
Glass - it's a very personal device, it's their power (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses does not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imagine the moment that handling virtual holographic items in the air is not only available to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a normal mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that's the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of the motto impressions could be an eight-way breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the second hand as a certain kind of base for displaying.
He's doing a great thing of compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding intent to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several directional ultrasonic beams at a defined point where the finger is located, triggers a motto sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on a belly of fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve ending in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive your brain?
So he thinks he's feeling what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to force a person who is physically located in a very difficult space to believe that he walks in an open, practically indefinite space - we also work on the concept of running lines (not as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deceiving becomes a target, there is a job for many years.
That's what does work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things are in complete beginnings.
Vkusivian instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrohradská avantgarde", dedicated to citizens who are headed, are an avantgarde of culture and art.
At the top of the list there were already significant figures of the Petrohrad art scene, whose extractions exceed the city's borders, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the vast voice.
The new hero of "Rosbalta" is a stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, in fashion hospice and on the Vernisay.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical teachers, the artists of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - he's a conspicuous man of petrohradian avantgarde in the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city man, his revelation on the streets makes a smile on the face of citizens increases the mood of all.
He recently took a bottle into his hand and became a petrohradian flasquinette, because he had grown into this complex role with his whole godly life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you go all over town in red and not in yellow or in turquoise?
- I chose red color as a view designer and a image.
In this world, the red color of the compromise between artist, imager and public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is just a little different from the gray, wakes up the aggressivity and awakens the bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discuss.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in the Navy, where my work was exposed.
I understand what my path is.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists have passed away, I couldn't understand.
I made friends with the artists of the new waves, with the post-gasoons, who brought us to "Pushkin's 10", and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the words.
- And it all merged in your art-clinic... - It was important for me to be in the centre of the Peterbourg culture where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I settled the place at Puškinské 10, and there was a music-art club, the bohemian club, the home of the petěrburk goddemo.
There were many born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Šnura brought the "Ucho Van Gogh" project.
The sparrow and his friends sang under a sleeve of light songs, dressed up in adhesive tricots, in the midst of the Igor Vdovin composer, which is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programs of hall-galivian times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, so his big career, basic education and training began from us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Gribojedov - it's the Art Clinic.
That's where our working and permanent guests left.
I'm the hero of last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the survey was organised in the press, the special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination of "The Artist of the Year" I was appointed, the ending of my peak.
In new times according to old rules, work is uncomfortable, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In these years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are a distinctive way.
Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which the modernity and penitence is being captured lively.
I'll have a show program "Russian Museum in clowns."
Clowns are overtime.
I used to be social, being like this is painful and terrible today.
But in clowns, everything's rubbing, it's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world the way of totalitarian disguise in order.
Today, people meet by clothes, oriented at an external mechanic, not an inner man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deceit will be removed by the disguise.
- We have recently seen you as a city flasinetist. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be it if I don't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultural breakdown occurs.
People used to meet in the heads, the gods loved one, the simple other people.
Today, everything broke into micro-companies, it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 banknote to like everyone.
Today we need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand viewers on Stas Michajlov!
- He's gonna find fans, there's a sex-social sphere.
And there's 300 people on the cultural ground, and 10,000 of them are not coming, and the result is less management, money, everything's screwing up.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one's gonna deceive them and break what's been done.
When I was young, I painted pictures of one collector hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings people usually end.
People are often mistaken today.
They say, "Cultural Culture, Consumer Culture.
There's no consumer culture, that's different.
I am a man of culture last day, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's not enough in Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an activist over culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
For good cars it wasn't in everything, cars may not understand too much culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner, because there's a need for big experts who appreciate these experts properly and bring them to the right path.
Today he prospers in taste.
The same Erarta, but it's different that they sincerely say that we don't accept all modern arts, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburg is?
- Peterburg - it's not the capital of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And in our shores, art is miserable.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
In Europe, there are very many people who are interested, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
There's only a weak layer with us.
We need art to become fashionable as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is implemented for the grant of St.Petierburg
Families in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of the cowboys with the earthquakes on board are on their way, looking for a surrogate planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep your family under no difficulty or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be captured, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says the highly built scientist of the State astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsia.
Living there is only possible in a large height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the questions of reproduction in space, scientists started with flora.
There were attempts on plants half a century ago.
Four generations of peas grown on the orbit are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
The insect was then carried out on orbit - very small fruit muskets of Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to verify how the embryo evolves in the state of trouble.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the exit.
But then trouble begins.
"The serious problem with the fact that this bird must find resistance, must stand on its own legs and start moving," says the Chief Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find resistance, the birds fall chaoticly and make boilers.
After 10 hours, the instincts have been completely extinct in freshly excreted birds.
Birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, in four days, they just died.
"We had two birds out, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them," commented on the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe of Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarcha" with the animals flew on the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but only beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were broadcasting into space already grassy.
They basically didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellite, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts have to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on earth, the cosmic rats were born to their offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a hard task.
Animals in the loss of the normal environment simply cannot implement their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens manages abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The highest danger was at the risk of the Circles.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Tea flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if he could last the flight to space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after this flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says the veteran of the rocket-easurveyor Vachtang Vagnadze sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after flight to space, she gave birth to Valentina Cireškov's first wife-cosmonaut daughter.
Andrijan Nikolajev was also the father of the child.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonauter, Savická, who visited the orbit twice and also worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We only have a few astronauts who have been born and growing in health after a long years.
"It may be dangerous even during orbital years," states the cosmaronaut-pilot, the Soviet Union Hero and the Ruska Valerij Poljakov Hero.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the area of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in terms of zero attractions, the cosmonauts develop the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water imitates the state of no difficulty.
Even though water is comfortable for adults, but in a strange way, it is a natural living for young children.
Small germans seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is located on average 9 months in the mother's fruit water and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first redemption, it will only last two weeks.
"That's very little for the child to forget something," says Marina Axenov's instructor.
In short, if the newborn baby is a more natural condition, then for women the natural inevitable gravity is more attractive for women.
In a condition of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvic muscles are very fast, dropping the ability of the body to release the foetus.
We can leave it aside if muscle stimulators work when they're born.
After all, it is possible for birth to be carried out in a special chamber in which the mother's body releases the fruit.
"And what else?" Valerij Poljakov asks complicated questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not affect the earthly attraction, it cannot properly shape the body or the muscle system.
The newborn on the orbit track cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be rid of what he needs for his development unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a person who will be completely unadapted to the environment here," predicts the Head of the Committee on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So it's just a theoretical issue today.
One day, however, the time will happen to reality and when the earthly people will be released in their corals on a far planet that will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the NKÚ: Control of the Screw System failed by the guilt of politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and quality legislation in the context of public procurement, but is laundering in its application.
In an interview for Aktually.cz this says Vice President of the Supreme Control Office Miloslav Kal.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application of it - that's what we think is missing," comments the current Kala situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest common control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter Nečase refers to the so-called "svarc system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is therefore prohibited or authorised?
"The law must be somehow set up, and if it prohibits anything, even the Prime Minister can not prevent the activities of the Office, which is obliged to control and enforce duties," says Kal.
You spoke at the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber on a joint project between the Czech and the German party in which the legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What was the point?
It's a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
The simplest thing is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation, and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the check is not yet closed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, legislation is possible for us "special and perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not sufficient to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What exactly can this project help you with, what is coming from it for you?
Such a common control could contribute to stop making efforts to strengthening laws, reducing and improving limits if it does not have such a positive impact.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but it does not always mean the lowest) price to eliminate enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal conduct.
But by reducing the contract limit, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Perhaps the system will absorb such a number of "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw them from it a lot easier than if the limit stays higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with translating legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NKÚ, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, as the NKÚ works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, is just forming a little different way, but basically both authorities are acting similarly.
The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a social arrangement, so these accounting courts also have at the level of individual societal countries - in this, the system is a little different from ours.
The BRH can only control the Federal Money, with us presented by state resources.
Public resources that are managed by the counties and municipalities are controlled there from the level of the Federal Accounting Courts.
What's more about the legislation there, so that's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects, Germany is marked as a model, but it can certainly not be said that it is better in everything.
So is it even necessary by having better controllers?
No, I'm sure I'm not, but I'm saying again, I don't like this comparison.
But it is important to say that even the countries we consider to be a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth working with our office, would it?
With regard to national legislation, what was the amendment of the Law on Public Contracts for your office, does its impact have already been shown?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet available for us in the control actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, you need to count on a certain delay.
We are looking at this only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool for "detektion of risk of insecurity", through which we have reached almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there these changes will obviously be manifested because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of selection procedure will be adjusted and similar.
So do you consider the approval of this law rather as an advantage or another burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that it's going to "clean" and it won't be possible to follow them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, the controlled persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Law on Public Contracts means the infringement of budgetary discipline.
Is the law worth striking in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must rule out those who want to attack and abuse him, not to punish those who commit formal doubts that have no impact on decision making.
This system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how's that coming out?
Let's see which way we're not running.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that ODS will not harass businessmen by controlling the so-called "svarc system" - and what does that mean?
Is the shark system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be somehow set up, and if it prohibits anything, neither can the Prime Minister prevent the activities of the Office, which is obliged to control and enforce duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're gonna do it like nothing.
In the Law on Public Contracts, there are relatively strict rules on how it is to be formally implemented - which is right to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application of it - that's what we think is missing.
Roads are freezing, mostly bicycles
In several places of the Czech Republic roads are frozen and also snowed.
Most of the time, the cars are driving, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovarian Region
In the Karlovar region, the roads were rigged this morning, but the places were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature decreased between five to ten degrees below zero, but it should be slightly warmed during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lower areas.
However, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Krušné Mountains.
The spaces were even lower visibility due to the fog, resulting in the data of the displacement of the country roadrs.
The R6 speed roads and the first class communication are now free of restrictions in the region.
However, caution is on the spot, for example, in some of the crossovers, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes including mountain roads are also driven.
But there are still remains residues of ice and snow places in some sections.
Particularly in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubický and Královskýhradský kraj
On some roads in the eastern Bohemia there is a threat of storm, in higher positions, and in the mountains there may be a striking layer of snow on its site, informing roads and motorways.
Engineers warn drivers against the ice, can form in particular in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The following can be in the vicinity of Lanškruna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or the High Myth, especially on the roads of other and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/443 and I/34 are treated with Svitav.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
A striking snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the Rychnov districts above Kněžna and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia, today is most often clear to half clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, blowing the weak wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in Plzeňský kraj are rideable this morning, but places with increased caution and the weather needs to be adapted.
It's freezing in the morning, the temperatures move between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The seats must also count on the fog, but the visibility will progressively improve.
It's coming out of information from the district roads dispatch.
D5 motorways are almost without restriction, but caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most roads of the first class have a dry and frozen surface.
On the southern Pilsensk and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Communications of the second and third classes are wet, and in this case also notices about frozen sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequencies in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
With snow cough on the road must count drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouck region today.
After a chemical sprinkler, she remained on the Redhorrh Sea and on her way to the Videlian Cross.
The engineers drove the snow to the terrain at night, in Šumpersk according to travel managers snowed about three centimeters.
In the other parts of the region, the cars are mostly driven without restriction.
"In Šumpersk lies in the highest positions of snow remains.
With snow coughs on the Redhorský saddle, the drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," said today the ČTK distributor of the Swiss road administration.
In the field at night, their colleagues on Jesenick, the roads up to the highest position are now according to them after chemical treatment wet and wet.
On Olomouck there are roads without restriction, however, in Šternbersk, drivers should be careful in forest seeds where cars remain wet.
Útský kraj, Liberec region
Several driving places are immediately reported in the morning by the roadman in the north of Bohemia.
Apart from a few places with snow attacked or with a refrigerator, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice on Ústecka is closed, it is based on police database.
The temperatures are kept in the lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lows, especially southeast of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems, and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications are not yet reported.
The appearance of the iceberg is reported by roads, especially from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the conditions for her were ideal at night - over the day of rain and the drowning snow, at night bright and freezing.
The main moves are reported to negative conditions on the I/13 road in the area of the Ústecké and Liberec Region.
The closet from Telnice on Knínice forced the deflected branches of trees that moved under the bear of snow to the vehicle.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages we like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and we say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers closer?
This is a national benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar declared on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held in parallel on December 20th, from 21th.
They will end approximately at a time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, then we made up all of this with our Honza Augusta artist.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the situation in which this world is once handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have also created a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The Tap Group also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The end of the world has been cancelled".
She's already very popular at YouTube today, will she also be at these Beneficial Concerts?
Of course, and in a complete conclusion, so if we do everything and the end of the world doesn't end...
All the interpreters will sing it at all three concerts simultaneously.
At the same time, the hymns will also be connected in the unique direct transmission to Czech television.
The words to this song wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomáš Hanák, also singing in it Xindel X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other figures of Czech cultural scenes, given that we organize a lot of Beneficiary events and concerts...
We're trying to intensely involve them in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the profit from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the barrier education centre Studeo, which has been implemented with the Tap civilian association in Jedličkova Institute for the sixth year.
Students of the Jedličkovice Institute are regularly undergoing teachers and devoted to activities that are enjoying and interested in them.
The students themselves do not have the means to act on their own, so we are trying to allow them in this way.
In the context of the construction of the Jedličko Constitution in the future, a separate building will be created to move to this project.
There are several musical groups and interprets at each concert.
Why would you choose them?
We tried to build a program that would address all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some similar "bombastic action" to the future?
In May, we will first perform in the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I would like to connect it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by hendicaped people.
How do you handle these paths logistically and organically?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric wheelchair, her carts must travel in a luggage space, and we are, of course, pulling a large amount of cargo and bedding with tools...
However, it has always been done without problems, the ČSA and the British Airways were greatly prepared for us to be surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to the exits abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in barrier-freeness, public access to hendiced and similarly.
What have you so far met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnessing that in the east, everything is still in complete beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is very barrier, there is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move himself in the center of the city.
It doesn't apply to self-priority, as if you prefer the wheelchairs in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civil associations trying to alert the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, what do we still have to catch up to a better country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common that even people with heavy hendicap are moving separately in the public, they can go to the toilet, museums, anywhere...
But it's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in social life, we're a little ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or the barrier is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change real.
So far, it's the only case of people who have strong will.
The Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago, what made you start her up in 1998?
I joined as a tutor in Jedlinka's constitution, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play saxophone among other things, so I started an interesting music ring with my colleague.
Well, in time, it's what our moderator Láďa Angelovich says, a little out of hand (Laughter).
But has popularity come in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting to famous singers and also actively working on the promotion of the band.
We figured that a job that doesn't see, basically as if it doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your aim to pull this up with the Tap Tap that high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical, everything new is taken carefully and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is of course regret, that's natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary because people with hendicap are not suffering from all abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I'm saying if something happens to people with hendicap, it's not just going to move on for them, but for the whole company.
This success has also helped you to be a strict boss, how many people have identified you?
If we want to do good work, we need to be uncomfortable in many things and require some discipline.
But I mean, that's completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with the head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to a test twice a week, go on the preparation and spend many time on concert journeys, so they are thrilled to leave them quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work, and that wants to achieve something.
Today, the band The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were in her early 1998?
Only the only Santa Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave, and come, that's impossible to stop.
Whoever has the will and taste has always the door open with us
The day before the expected end of the world will take place on Thursday, 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynoje for the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities are connected to the telemost at the end of the evening during the joint singing of the band The Tap Tap "The end of the world has been cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multi-use barrier education centre STUDEO at the Jedličkova Constitution in Prague in a volume of CZK 25 million
Check-in is CZK 400, children under the age of 12 have free tickets in advance sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Poland was adopted at the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency last week for the 20th member of this European Space Agency as the other country from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of projects of the Agency over the next years.
However, Poland's way to space has begun much earlier.
Flying into space, Polish enthusiasts were devoted before World War II; but not always met with understanding.
For example, I would like to remind you of the lecture A. Šternfeld in Warsaw's astronomical observers, who, on 6 December 1933, represented the ideas of his pioneering work, entering the spacecraft.
The thoughts of a young engineer (born 1905) left listeners cold and after the years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for joining the cosmonautics in France.
The remembered Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator for astronomy and astronauts.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagator of cosmonautics and his contribution was appreciated by one of the craters on the other side of the moon was named his name.
In 1925, a railway track was built in Poland, which should have been equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the missile was to be used for the dissection of the codridor or to sound it.
The information about this secondary is only known from the time press.
Since 1933, the missiles began to take over the Polish artillery.
The research was provided by the Company of Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Professor Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is obvious that research has grown into the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted by research.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric prosecution missile was presented in the professional press, suggested by the engineer Rohozinski and the work of Rakieta - air torpedo and a rocket projection of the aircraft author Lelil-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of missile technology were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymporary Advisory and Science Committee), which he coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after the two-year activity, its activities ended the start of the war.
Further work devoted to astronautics after the war in the Polish press appeared thanks to the work of the Polish astronautical society (Polish Astronautic Society).
The first mention of the company in November edition of the 1954 magazine Problems, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronauty.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with astronauts.
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites were already running, and it was clear that space research is a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautical society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronautic Federation (founded in 1951) and has already become a proper member in autumn.
And in the following year, the first President of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He held this function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of very successful RM meteorological missiles, which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start was October 10, 1958.
The missile with access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 the flight test of RM-2 was launched in the Bledov desert.
The missile was 1,4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type had already been able to real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should have reached up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height wind.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
Following the first RM missiles, the Meteor-1 missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The missile was designed as two-step, its total length was 510 cm and the starting mass was 32,5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from the size of space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A missile, space of 0,4 litres was available, Meteor-1B of 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile development was conducted in the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile had a 380 kg start weight and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
The abolition of the Law on Public Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court cancelled public work law.
The resolution caused a live discussion in public.
Surely it will be interesting to look at this issue from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, nothing unrestricted movement of private capital along with unnecessary financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the labour price, there is a price voltage.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is seeking to deal with the imports of cheap goods in competition by "training" the price of a competitor in order to cut a larger market share and thereby increasing its own profits.
In a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production to foreign or to buy cheaply or to disappear. As a result, there is a high unemployment in countries where labour prices are compared to other high economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for the unemployment produced, the social expenditure of the State is essentially rising.
The whole situation enhancing the full failure of businessmen to pay taxes and thus replacing the economic and social damages he has caused in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to include specific statistical data.
Individual private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to all the people, irrespective of the social decline.
This is particularly reflected in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to adopt a pricing private capital dictate in particular in the wages area.
This is, however, a system of economic enforcement in the case of long-term unemployment, but by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with the rise in differences between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN, there are already many years of public food expenditure for the poor who cannot benefit from their own work.
The number of these people are already going into millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are quite common cases that duly employed people receive such wages that they have to be paid to their existing minima.
This scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Chamber.
Consistent measures in practically all the southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic disadvantaged social level are either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hunger wages at the edge of the company, hoping that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
But is it necessary to ask where he comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty from one country to another will be moved or not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egyptian or Africans are still working for a fraction of European wages.
That's about Latin America.
Liberal theory and media in the irritation argues that it cannot become a capital participant in its own economy that the economy managed leads to a economic disaster.
Private capital of the public insists that the State must not interfere with the management interventions of the economy.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, now he actually controls politics and thus in his own self-esteem state.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
The existence is practically versatile and in all states of the lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in corruption, providing mutual advantages, legislation, where everything is practically criminal, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that the Ministry of State for the lack of funds are putting forward proposals for laws to private legal firms that are lost in connection with industry.
These laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as it spells the Western type, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation described by Appiános in its work of the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia:" The state has been in full degradation for a long time and the authorities have been engaged in violence.
For bribes, unlawful acquisitions by means of stones or swords.
The bribes and corruption were warned without any obstacles, and the people went to elections with a pre-proposed voice" ..."the charming people were not approaching the office at all, so once it was due to this dismantling it was to stand without consuls." . . . . . . It was really beginning to talk about that the only drug in the bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose a energetic man. "The Appiános thought of Pompeia, but it became Caesar who changed to permanent democracy on the self-government.
Conclusion As in antiques, the current company is based on an irresponsible self-benefit preference regardless of the overall interest.
Private capital is no longer capable of understanding and applying a whole-social benefit.
The result is now, as it has been, an unprecedented decade of elit without any effort to reform deeper nature.
Therefore, we must seek the causality of fascist and communist regimes in the unequivocal liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
The discontinuation of these systems in favour of the liberal type democracy may be considered to be a certain break with the expectation of another round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the current elites completely ignore possible hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The abolition of the Law on Public Works is not a solution, at least not a permanent solution.
Under the pressure of competition both at international and intra-European level, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Therefore, this trend is a systemic trend.
The solution is a targeted political-social reform that strengthens the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthens the impact of citizens on government and weakens the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: The Laboratory of chaos.
"The violence will never go away and cannot even" Sting in the Fragile song whose main verse in the refractory is "don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, there have been a lot of reactions.
One is behind Israel, argues his right to self-defense, and Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argued by the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel matches the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is in periodically recurring waves of killing the guilt and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self - law, have been born in the current political situation and the beginning of violence have not experienced.
It is my point to offer the readers a look for the tire, a view of who, first of all, serves the tension lasting for 95 years (counted from Balfour's Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding who, or which group of people is the main rider of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first of all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down some of the great Alexander or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is if they were always those personalities that autonomously drove their steps and whether they were behind their throne someone who directed their actions to a predetermined target.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not come into life of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one that could be considered an octopus' head (if there is someone else I don't know about them, but I don't rule it out) - Rothschield.
It doesn't say much about them.
Obviously.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s to stop connecting their name with highly criminal works in which they stood and which always meant strengthening power, multiplying wealth or both for them.
They have major shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where central bank shares do not lead or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was only 5 countries, after Kaddafi's reversed only four, but in the meantime, Russia undergone the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to deny this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschield Bank of America, he began to issue his own (understand government) money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK started spending his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered in 1963, Ms Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the launch of a large economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led between 1859 and 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars by the highest age, the 33nd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of removing large monarchist nationals in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially the Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 to 1 billion people (as many slaves for their comfort and luxury are sufficient and do not consume enough resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than foreseeable for such solutions) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of richest families in the forehead with Rothschieldy works is to create a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the FED to avoid recurrence of the crisis as the one they caused in 1907).
So after they managed to murder the habsburg successor of the R-U throne of Ferdinanda in Sarajev, to launch the first world war, the Carago Russia destroyed by triggering the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the need for war to destroy Carago Russia) and then there was a fragmentation of Central European power, Austria Uherska.
For the ease of the second World War, the politicians had to create a latent conflict situation by imposing a huge war reparation on Germany, thus creating a radicalization of boasting masses, and then just enough to plant them to the Germans sufficiently strong, guilty and simple solutions offered by the Leader and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that had to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in the light of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields set up a Sionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judah with Jerusalem as a capital city (return to Sion).
The Balfour Declaration has already created an assumption for the mass immigration of the Jews to Palestine, which began to face the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War exploded, whether Hitler had ruptured from the chain on which international bankers held it at the beginning, or all that he had done was hard to estimate, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentrations created an assumption for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like the war reparations of Germany made for the 2nd World War, the outbreak of the third war was created by the State of Israel.
If international bankers succeed in spreading it, the Jewish nation, like in the other, will be victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or in general the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratorium, a source of worm and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (We will take the hard part of people on the supporters and the opposer of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in Palestine - Israeli conflict, where the wrongs cause the endless chain of violence when at the beginning of all the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers support the choices of people solely own candidates.
The present Prime Minister of Israel is the Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascisting international bankers of loyal, politician who does everything to launch a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in Shanghai's cooperation organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to increase in the global conflict and given the control of Iran over the Hormuzian flow, which travels 20% of all world oil (the flood corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to destroy the world economy.
In what light is now the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world's order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of fifty financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And he forces all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on the forehead, so that he cannot buy or sell who is not marked on behalf of that goose or the digit of her name.
That's what you need to understand: who's got the sense to get the number of the beast.
That number marks a man and it's number six hundred sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he occupied the crowds of demonstrators of the Islamist students of the American embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They should have been released in exchange for the defamated scale of Mohamed Rézu P header, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, who were the patron of his regime for decades.
For American administration, the situation did not offer a positive exit - to throw the gambling through the deck could not afford, as it would essentially jeopardise confidence in allies in other countries.
The release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the creation of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a hit for the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco attempt to free the hostage force.
Prisoners were finally released after 444 days, after the negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their work at home caused the wave of solidarity and the anti-iran sentiment.
Debakl in Iran made a significant contribution to Jimmy Carter's sin with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film of Ben Affleck Argo's directing actor describes one episode of the story that Americans brought a small victory.
Six employees fled from the embassy just before the embassy was settled.
After the complex peripetuals, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA managed to get them out of Iran in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, thereby helping the extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff, which in the country looked at the location for filming sci-fi velkofilm.
Manufacture of genres
The plan that invented an expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
For the legend to be credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film comes from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realistically captured political thriller, also called "caper movie", a story of a piece, a trick - an example can be a series of Danny partners.
The film thus alters the moods - on the one hand documentaryly captured sequences from Tehran (in the headline sequence, iconic photographs of the times of events are shown and the way the same situation was shown in the film - there are great differences in it).
On the other hand, lightning passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a mild oversight.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -management in the dressings -- they solve the situation at the tables, on the halls of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck made a rebound of careers in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director from a filthy actor, and his acting had ceased to be the objective of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third full-time movie, after the dark crimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck image that doesn't play in Boston's home director.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics of the older directors' films excellence over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows him in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the movie take place in the streets when reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also mediates the emulation of confusion and the inconceivability that occurs when history is clear.
Similar effects of Affleck and his coworkers are achieved in the stages made (famous staff on the Tehran bass).
Too many events in too many places
The director must've dealt with the story that was told doesn't really offer much in the film sense of exciting scenes.
Quite successfully working with it almost, sometimes something will think about reality - there is no way that everything is so elegant (the scene in which the threatful crisis at the Tehran airport turns the phone in America and the chase after the ranch is working pretty tight for hair).
The weakening Arga is, however, the discernment resulting from the need to show too many things in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of the Hollywood co-workers, but their figures would deserve more space and they're not the only one in that film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing a dramatic move, it's a picture that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciate the realization of the retro style evoking thrillers in the 1970s.
It'll be hard to shoot.
As a reminder of one still in a certain way of living history and proof of how exaggerated the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but it is sufficient.
Rules for inflammation of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually declares the most abundant bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for the "best regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"It led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court on the uniting of insurance rates for men and women is already among the nominated absurdities.
To date, women at life insurance prices have been favoured because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can nominate by the end of this year.
The vote will then be held by the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The controversial regulation of the EU also includes compulsory mixing of biofuels into fuels, which, as a result of natural damage, also prohibits the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances or the Directive on the size of chicken cages for which eggs have been significantly healed this year.
The criticism has also faced a real ban on the use of the expression of massel or the elimination of classical bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The EU's aparate often decides under the pressure of the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend certain states or groups (so the Czech Republic is now also the threat of the veta promotes the requirements of its banks).
The interest of the lobby was that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach lengths of at least 14 cm in the Union and could not show "anonymous curve".
The European Commission has defended itself by simply harmonising existing unified national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened over the opposition of certain states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for victory in anket may also be the EU Regulation last year, according to which it must be compulsory for inflatable balloons sold that children under 8 years must not be inflated without the supervision of adults.
The EU has called for American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of the death of children to strangle.
Similar restrictions are now applicable to children under 14 years of age in blowing into pilgrims.
The curious ideas are born at home
It is also quite absurd for European officials themselves - everyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of Greece and must speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, the Bank charge.com server has nominated for a survey, in addition to some of the above, the EU Regulation on the volume of food stocks within the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set in preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with high fines.
Surveillance organisers have also taken the idea to pay certain countries for not having the sea and an idea of granting grants on a request for the grant.
However, these ideas did not occur in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by no sea.
We will ask the European Union for refunds," said the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As a argument, he argued that we were born a lot of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases it was meant to become full of warehouses that he had to export.
For moving on to the ports, the EU was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palase.
Finally, the European Commission has come out of the Czech Republic by organising a tendency to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant was offered to the Municipal Development Ministry, managed by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, to write a request for a subsidy from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are exceptions
While the regulation is easy in the Member States to become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, while at the same time the more efficient functioning and development of the whole Union, it is rather deserving that many experts deserve recognition.
More serious problem is, for example, by experts, drawing up EU grants on projects that do not have anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have forced Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The emotions between Bohemia also raise that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to designate their traditional products in Brussels, and not always succeed in this match.
Although after the six-year struggle with the Germans and the Racushans, they made a mark of olomouck shapes, but domestic rum, whose tradition is touching us by the 19th century, our producers had to rename to the land.
The name of rum can only bear cane distillate products, not sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, feta and gorgonzole, marcipan of German Lübeck or Parmese have already been found in the company of world-known cheeses, such as the Karlovar sugars, the hood and the third-bone caprine chapel.
The EU's security mark may then also be proud of the perimeter and magnesium tubes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for the president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't watch the last 20 years of the country's raiding as the thieves run, people get higher taxes and retirement ages.
I shouldn't have been politicians.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I was 40 years old and I'm an independent nest, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for Senator or President.
You got into the senate, but you went to the castle.
Aren't you turning your back on people who chose you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the castle as the result of the senatorial elections.
Later, I pointed out that if I was elected senator, I'd be running for the president.
But my goal is not a function, the function is a tool to make my visions happen.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we are broadcasting in a pub and television, but that we are going to spoil anyone who wants to try to change.
This adds to the media that dehonest people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
Perhaps I was claimed to be a paying journalist or a consultant of Jiří Paroubk.
Let's go to your vision.
You went into the fight for the Castle with the physical and criminal responsibility of politicians and remitted property confessions over 20 million.
You have to change the law to that.
But as president, you have no authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I lobbed as a citizen for conducting free business, it managed to get rid of it.
The problem is politics - if someone comes with a good design from the left or right, he will approve of rejection, and that will delay the citizens.
As an independent obstacle, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is, without a side-by-chilling and dogmat, I can take something that is best for our country, on every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-hand person or a left-hand person?
From the czech point of view, I think people are more of a left line.
It's not important to me if a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're pissed off when someone says you're a populist.
But you can't prove it to what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some perfect goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer.
Someone can call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are working or talking about are important experts in the world.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only have passwords.
And you can't do that in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them that you can deal with criminal and material responsibility for example?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them to our side to set it up.
If I was elected President, it is not a problem to organise the television direct transmission, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enforce material and criminal responsibility for politics, officials, judges and state attorneys.
And they'd have to say why they didn't want it.
If a strong personality is named non-screws, it can be pushed on a political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was a credit for public pressure.
I'm just saying I'm an amateur that I'm not even a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm looking for allies.
I just started in politics, and I'm gonna try to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work, I'm done in six years, and I'm going back to the private sector.
It sounds kind of like Okamura should spare the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, which is why I've been circumcised by a number of known people whether they would also run to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, and he refused for a lot of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenco, which covered the fraud of light fuel oils.
I was running for people to be really dissatisfied, but now I'm serious.
Sixty percent of people didn't go to elections, and those who went, most of them chose the representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you thinking of setting up your own side?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check out the pure past of every potential party, and I don't even have the money.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand on my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property, I'm guessing about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land for about 25 million, a ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of art works for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and the Superb damage for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I've always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, he was gallant to women and at the same time fought against badness and nonsense.
You drive Aston Martin, you have assets for $60 million, and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to be joking?
I've already hit a campaign of 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that I don't think I'm interested in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay my money.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover the amount of senator's salary.
But I wouldn't make it out of him, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd silent these activities?
But that doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I partially silented my activities.
For example, the travel agent will become my deputy in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I need to live from something, too.
How used to taking a month as a businessman?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I'm going on.
And if I was president, I'd end my business.
You will find the whole conversation in the Saturday edition of the Law.
MVRDV Architects are proof that real adventures do not only happen in the head - for example Spickenisse and recently built Mountain of books - 2 pictures
"This building seems happy to me, looks futuristic. Finally, it's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, which goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, thinks, "Over, the house is nice."
But I ask what else we need today's library.
They all have Internet, iPads and electronic books.
No one's volunteering to any of these libraries in the old style anymore, right?
Spikenisse, a seat close to Rotterdam without his own jobs, which is not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants demonstrates the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision has fallen to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted turtles of fictional bridges displayed on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive was not very dizzy.
And so the city councilmen knew that there was only one way to become the masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Wine Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of crazyly bold column charts and maker of funny, often even cynical constructions, accepted a thing with normal peace and appeared in the 2003 competition negotiations with five books under the arms and a sleeve on the face.
And while the committee looked around and shook around her shoulders, the vicious Maas raised his gifts on himself according to the size and his actively reasoned speech ended the words "Great Municipality!"
So this is my proposal to the Mountain of Books in Spikenisse, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was set at 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalisation project, including underground parking, supermarket, mail and several adjacent residential and serial houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of the books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The Malomy hedge that has not yet been able to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, for whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer by a little bit of a courteous architecture.
But above all, now Spikenisse has the first public cultural structure in the history of his existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: reader eldorado under a hatch on cheese.
While the elevator drives the mass of the mountain, you will discover the real space and reader passion when the topography is walking.
From all sides of the glass interior is bright and clear, floor from the burnt corridor and elegant street lantern clearly expresses the atmosphere of the public square.
City environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally, there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a great dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a classic spatial configuration upside down, and we removed the space for the readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of the books is widely used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological centre and home technology.
The special pleasure is the black police for books that are one of the walls, one parapet, and another I'm gonna rob the stairs.
The appearance, the structure and the smell are coming from the circumstance.
Even the architects and construction engineers will invade their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Problemorst, the project leader at the village of Spikenisse, on the request of the Standard magazine.
So, one day, in a french farm, we ran into an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years, it has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a basis under the roots of the millimeter rouno from synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons, and then it's mature to throw them into volume waste.
For the library, the rouno - for the first time in this quantity - was slim on boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
The effect of the heat and pressure is called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colored in dark, homogeneous and difficult material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs, you'll get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters of long travel you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also by Dutch fences and figs in the flower shops.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially the proper humidity of air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass areas, a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says the trouble.
He's heating up and cooling down the Earth's heat.
Although the mountain of books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in just a short time, even in sunny days.
Wide glued wooden ties, which stands for glass facade, serves as sealing and captures a large part of sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of them will handle fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial scout from the IT business, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even refers to as "the long-term soul" Spickenisse.
Reason: every resident of the city was invited to open up a few weeks ago to devote one book from his personal fund.
This was supposed to be first filled with optical gaps in a currently not completely equipped library, which currently contains 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proved itself.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident has a relationship with a new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for the ornament.
That's what the MVRDV has done in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the professional shark.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
Whatever it is young and uneducated.
This is finally the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote when deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on the relations between the US and the Europe of Stephen Szabo, Berlin balances on the close edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first announced that it would vote against the proposal for the Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be cautious about his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's gonna support an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote when it was a flightless zone.
NATO finally sold it.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear attitude on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that he's just changing his foreign policy, and that's from a policy that was so-called the US-controlled, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to "the more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
What in particular means "normal" foreign policy from a German perspective?
It demonstrates readiness to take into account national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and their relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from the economic interests of other greatness and therefore must protect Germany’s interests.
Did economic interests have an impact on the position in the near-eastern conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has a large residency in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Gulf of Persia.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to scare the public but not to elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to add too much meaning, that's not a unilateral relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the US have damaged when Germany has abstained in the case of both important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the US, he has a great understanding of the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was in Libya's question.
Hopefully, Germany will even make some respect out of this.
This signals that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views of the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the US clearly expressed themselves for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think that Obama's government may have a considerable understanding of the European position.
But, of course, as a result of that political situation, this attitude cannot be public.
I think that differences in opinions really aren't as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not quite happy with the Netanjahu policy.
Isn't it difficult for Germany to bring close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what makes the Germans difficult.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line, and instead they have to drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he even want to take over the main role?
Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country, it is still hard to play a bigger role for obvious reasons.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, when Germany takes a greater role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position in this regard than the US.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly dropping, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at present.
Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and it makes them much more uncomfortable - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is Deputy Director of Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution where academics and experts on European and North America are studying jointly the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Shabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Travel Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what's Armani Polo?
This covers a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he is taking protection for as long as the actual brand owners are sued.
And then it's not even clear whether they're going to do the law.
"For a foreigner, it is increasingly difficult to protect its brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office specializing in the violation of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, there's a new case on my writing table.
The counterfeiters will have a few extra letters to sign their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies are legally copied, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens the caterer with records of the Peking Board.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company had to protect the trademark of Zegna DF Puma. A artificial name that parasites on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities there are several floor business houses in which almost exclusively sold counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases are different, but with the mandate of his mandants, it opposes the Chinese companies to receive entirely the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere from the stamp office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
This word is focused on "Bang Dakuan."
That's what the women who hunt rich men are.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages the deal, we have to fight it," calls the Pattloch.
"The test is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and court costs of the affected business go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the CLSA research company, China is the third largest market for luxurious goods and markets that grow as fast as possible.
However, the removal of doubtful records in the brand register can be achieved difficultly and it costs something.
The control can stretch for nine years, with a uncertain result.
The Pattloch tells about the cases where the court has rejected the lawsuits because the name in question has become "market reality" after a long time.
If the defendant has bad luck, he has to pay the plagiar because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machines, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps on the Putzmeister concrete mix.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use the emblem, which is similar to the star of Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. Spor was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
A manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO marking office admits that in 2010 there were shortcomings due to too little number of employees and space.
But last year, it was allegedly "the course of the work process returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed objections proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
The 57,000 of these cases were closed, by 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet, there are still 81,500 complaints to be dealt with at the office.
It's expensive to do something against it.
As often in China, they're impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million brand protection applications were delivered by CTMO, which is almost a third of more than 2010.
That's a record, and that means China's 19th behind it leads a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - there are 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion of Yuans were selected on fees.
This simply means that every login average costs 1280 Yuans or 160 euros.
The case of the German family company Freudenberg is several times against it.
This company has been fighting the Chinese plagiar for over seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitated car parts has been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to ensure Chinese rights to Freudenberg.
We would be reminded of that as the surname cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office also rejected the Monachium Company's objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg has become lawful, but the opposer in the dispute continues to fight until now.
You need to be so careful.
Now the matter is being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The direction is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
In the company archive, they had to even look at hundreds of years old to submit evidence.
Fifteen years ago, Freudenberg offered a "high six-digit amount in euro" for settlement of the dispute.
"You see what it means to us from that," says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East threatens Europe too.
And that's when the imitators get unprotected marks.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business has already given up, but it has been able to reverse the registration.
"You have to be very careful," said Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamp rights, but foreigners would rather have "all that's worth any way to protect, to sign in China," said Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg, in the last act of his drama, undergoes the mark, he will probably have to pay the counterparty license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World Day Fighting AIDS: Singing, Singing, Help
Heidelberg testes the Imbongi congregation - and in Swaziland it makes orphans happy for parents who died of AIDS.
A story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's assing: cowboy high shoes, basketball boots, ladies' boats and men's mocasins looking for the tactics parket and they find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of singers will slowly be lifted - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - insisting, moms and each other are prosecuting.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile boots when it connects the voices with its very wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the musical hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, testing the Imbongi congregation a new song.
Fifty singers and singers came between 23 and 69 years, from the researcher of human genetics to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each congregation voice has another text, and yet in a very foreign language - a zulu speaking 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesothu, Malawi, Mozambique and in the parts of Swaziland.
Help for your help
Unaids, the United Nations Programme for Disease AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people live around the world who are infected with HIV.
Of which, 23,5 million lives in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans from parents who died of AIDS in Swaziland.
HIV positive is more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, the village of Esitjeni found Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them visit second-degree school.
Patronage may be taken per month in EUR 15 or 20.
It guarantees a child's school uniform and one warm meal daily in Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "the story teller" or "the one who glorifies".
No one can talk in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has practiced songs in this foreign soft speech and sometimes it brings back where they originally come from: south Africa.
In the air distance of 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, the Kingdom of Esitjeni is in the northeast of the Sussia, which depends on the mass of the German congregation’s votes.
Forty percent is infected
There's about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple aluminum or slammed chicks, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they have HIV.
In Esitjeni, it is seen in a small place where all the stables of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infectiousness, the lowest expected life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of male preskin, which provenably reduces the risk of disease by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of weak immunity inside themselves, there is no rare thing to die in less than thirty years.
This village discovered the congregation on a joint journey to Africa in spring 2005. First of all, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets, which were missing not only parental care, but cleanse all: food, clothing, education.
Without graduate education, they have no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals, which in a few euros made it possible to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the "Voices for Africa" congregation has been established, which has since been taking care of orphans to parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually portable infections
What are the most serious sexually portable diseases?
The bacterial SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and hood (gonorea).
Frequent viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The ammunition and the scab belong to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syfilis and hoodles occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert's Institute Love comes from the fact that at least four of all five cases of siphyllitis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults there are sexually transmissible diseases that occur often, chlamydi infections, trichomonades, candidas (plain), capaves and human papillomavirs.
HIV is among heterosexual adults that are relatively low in us, but approximately 20 percent of the newly infected HIV people fall to this group.
Chlamydi’ s infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections relate to young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavirs often occur among our youths.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syphilids, according to the Institute of Robert, loves from 1697 diseases in 2001 more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIVs has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were some 2700 cases.
That's about one ten less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the area of genitalia, urination, outflow, pain in the abdomen and blisters or nipples.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unreasonable.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
Dangerous diseases can reduce condoms, but do not offer 100% protection.
For the agents of sexually portable diseases can be partially transmitted infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, in particular in the case of frequent replacement of sex partners.
In the case of early diagnostics, most SPIs can be cured and subsequently prevented.
Thanks to the patronage, the charitable gifts, and last but not least to the fees that the congregation earns by singing all over Germany will gather some money.
"We have already sent about EUR 200,000 to Esitjena so far," says Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the Zodwa Promini village itself, a self-confident woman who can settle.
She also cares for the seed children to find a shelter, for example with some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the old women are called wolves, are the resistance of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they make sure that the kids come to school every day in time in uniforms.
Children who no longer have no one go to Khanyisile's shelter, a lonely woman who pays the association as well as two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" started the school of sewing, built two jackets and together with the American PSI health organization arranged that many people in the village had HIV tested.
Even if the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone keeps quiet of it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely a taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has something to do with sexuality."
Actually, it's pretty strange in the country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King of Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
We're polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this approved state of life is also guilty of spreading the HIV virus so quickly over the past decades.
But many migratory workers that spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected relationship."
In order to at least support a little cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confident of the black continent that many in the southern tip of the black continent know even from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black people's language - such appreciation brings not only the mood and joy, but also has excreted tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road also leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village is hardly found on maps, the valley of Ezulweni is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's a light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an airline of 8733 kilometers from here, to the assy singers in the Bergheimer Straße testroom, you see that the light is shineing here.
Messenger: NASA discovered in Mercury Ice
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there's ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Even when the sun is closest, there is also frozen water, as it shows from three studies published on Thursday the professional magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe found evidence that there was an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in a constant shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters, and maybe even up to 20 meters strong.
This water seems to come from the comet or perhaps from the asteroids that hit Merkur.
But let us not find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leading scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Merkur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsia.
However, findings could help us to clarify how the water and other basic elements of life got into other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unrecognited earthquakes, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, the images will come to Earth, a small window to endless distances.
The image comes from the photographic apparatus that the German scientists developed from the Institute of Max Planck.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the crusade planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circles around the sun behind Neptun, Ceres is not according to the new conceptual definition of the International astronomical Union of 2006 "planet".
This cut from the infrared screen Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pinkly colored "reborneata" in the nation hall of stars.
This area where the stars are formed - scientists call it W5 unromantically - found Spitzer's telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia in 6500 light years.
This variable heat of dying star captured Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The stubborn ring consists of a material that the star has wiped out during the process of dying.

One of the largest and sharpest images of Hubble's telescope: Vire galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies become real artwork, according to their coloring.
The call published by the European Southern Observatory shows a number of thousands of light years away from Trifid's fog in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (distributed to three parts, three-cold) because the dark stripes of dust divides the warming heart of this starbird into three parts.
In the constellation of the Hadonos astronomers photographed the spectacle of the cosmic precipitation: within 400 million light years of Earth, the core of two linguistic galaxies has to come to a collision inevitably.
This birth of the star recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not like technical shortcuts can call it a nickname of the South Wind.
Photographs from Hubble's space telescope show Iris' fog in Cefea's constellation.
This 1400 lighting years of the distant fog consists of dust varieties, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
Shows a ring from a black hole that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Route.
The crab of the stars gives rise to new growth.
Also, this star cloud, connected to Rosette's nebula, is still born new young stars. They are 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There is no dust in this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, but just gas.
Scientists believe it was only shortly after the Great Bang when it was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views into the universe: the most important telescopes
The long-sighted view was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo, he used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views that mediate are still deeper.
The world's largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope for Palomar observers near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had an average of five meters.
Large Binocular Telescope stands in the American Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures on average 10,4 metres.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to support costs.
Yet, its average is about eleven meters.
The disadvantages of the cheap way of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook in an altitude angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope is fixed in the altitude angle in Texas.
His speciality is the high strengthening of the light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world’s biggest mirror lens.
Using the radioteleskope in Arecib (Portorico), scientists in space are searching for alien signals.
This radiotelescop is 305 meters average.
For "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help every computer owner that gives his calculation performance available.
The view of the Observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chilean Andes.
There's a very big telescope standing here, and he's honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extreme telescope is also planned for the Chilean ESO observers.
Its main mirror is to have a full of 42 meters and it is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
But the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, besides them, looks into the universe and through the telescope of Subaru and IRTTF.
Also, Mauna Kea is supposed to create a new giant telescope - with a three-time mirror diameter.
Here you can admire him on the picture.
However, the most important impressions of the universe mediate the Hubble space.
The activities of remote worlds have been offering us since April 24, 1990.
Cosmic telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those who are resident.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been found since the beginning of the mission.
Last preparations prior to the launch of the space telescope Kepler are documented in the picture.
James Webb (JWST) will first be shot into the universe on board the Aryan missile.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxy on the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on ice and on the southern field of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, since the Messenger crosses around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for several decades that it is ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger’s sonda, which was sent out in 2004 and is the first to be around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day and live with 168 years
In South Azerbaijan, many are living in the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In South Azerbaijan, many are living in the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call Talys the wildly romantic ride.
Microbus rolling on the road with many corners along the thickly wooden hills, drastic rivers and simple selves.
Everything's green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the farest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of Talys, which is not well known, besides that he speaks perfectly persky and barbarian and experiences a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is swinging too monumental architecture from the Soviet times, which is not suitable for the picturesque mountain landscape.
The tourists from Europe don't come here. The arrival from the Arbaistan capital of Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours are needed for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairytale wealth that the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, the Pilata Fatulajev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the ability to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Prize of Eurovision in May - and we will have the world's greatest festival next year," says Fatulajeva.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talyšów from the surroundings who are centuries old. Fatulajeva shows black and white photos.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he became a child.
However, the resenting star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep of Müslümov, which was supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest man with documents was 122 years old, Muslümov’s age seems very doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajev.
This man was supposed to be married three times and had 23 children.
Didn't Müslümov have been wrong about a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Institute of Maxe Planck, in Rostock, also heard of flight people in Central Asia.
"Scholz says, "also in Sardinia, there are very many old men living in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be given because of the missing evidence, especially when there is no matrix.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerico are experienced by Bible ages very often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are 100 years old.
So why does he live here in the south of so many flights?
Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the special Talys genes.
On the contrary, the director of the museum Fatuljev believes that it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of Talys, who love meat, bread, and especially milk products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, it does not seem exactly credible from the bromatological point of view.
Or is this the original way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near Lerik, Rubaba Mirzajeva lives.
In 97 years, she is relatively young to this geographical width.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with a butterfly, which he's annoyingly kissing.
There are eight people under the roof, including one of the sons of Mirzajev and the daughter: both of them are grandparents long ago.
There are two little children around.
The kitchen is prepared for guests for tea, which is served in typical abdominal glasses "armade".
The white teeth of Mirzajeva make a perfect series and hides a long dark blonde copy that proudly reveals to us her son.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look and kept my color.
"I've never used shampoo either," said Mirzajeva.
Monthly retirement is enough.
She's always eaten just what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
In my whole life, I haven't bought food in the supermarket one time.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
It was the worst in World War II.
But everything got better when the village took over "loved father" Geidar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds weird from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan, does not know the limit.
He was at power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the village.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan don't have an emergency.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manatas every month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is a leverage for the current ratios from which you can enjoy well.
And maybe he's right, even the long - shredded son of Mirzajeva: "The old people live in our culture of great seriousness."
They live in the middle of a great family, they are loved, guarded, and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Disturbed demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the deep spread of the country.
It is hard to discuss a future institution based on chariot law.
The Egyptian president didn't spare the patose.
We have to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible for people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian kopts, to the liberals, to the enlightened Muslims and to secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly distracted in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "I love the state" in Nile, given to the grace of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologised said that he temporarily reduced the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended yours to "safe the Revolution."
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has a degree of doctor at the U.S. University in South California really does not have to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear.
Should the judiciary be disposed of power?
234 paragraphs, which the stand-of-the-art Constitutional Assembly with Islamists, have quickly approved in the 15-hour night maraton, partly raise concern.
As in the former constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what do you mean, the rules?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists use this most clear formula and with it the connected legal free space for a more stringent interpretation of the sharía.
At least this explains the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to sharía, it is necessary to consult with the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
It does not, but it may mean that the clergy will be supervised by law enforcement, which would bring justice to a factual withdrawal of the rightness.
There are a lot of interpretations in the design of the Constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts is to continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to repress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal stands, the State should also protect the "righteous essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is so legally formulated that the state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature by means of this paragraph.
In understandable speech, it means nothing but censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
Another paragraph forbids a disgrace or arguing the prophet Mohamed and his emissary.
But it is unclear that is disgraceful and how it will be prosecuted.
It's also doubtful that the formula is prohibited by "imunification of people".
Is it enough in this case that the President's caricature or a joke on the account of the experts?
The interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Mursi will submit to the signature, and according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the purpose of the people vote.
"Revolution is back."
For several weeks, the opposition against the Islamist crossings has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual clarity on Friday night at Tahrír Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional paper before it started to pay.
"Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was placed in the presidential elections in the third place.
The Nobel Prize carrier and the former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej declared that the proposal of the Constitution was "on the trash of history".
Through the service of short messages, Twitter accused Mursi's advocate that they wanted to do "puccifier against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and cast it," said the opposition member Jasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not punished," quoted the Egyptian media of the opposition politician Chálid Alí.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood declared rebellion, but not at Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the second shore of the Nile before the Cairo University.
She was attended by many hidden women and salafists who called, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called Mursi, "Clean the earth!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
Fighting for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would probably induce a state of a civil war like that.
Mursi's accomplices obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opposers and the supporters of the proposal of the Constitution were loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people in the election uren decide which direction the country should go.
Most of them are considered to be certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The Word of Human Rights doesn't exist"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, claims the Hafize Abu Sa'd.
The eighth-year-old human rights defender and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or stood before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights for him are invisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution there are no words of "human rights" nor once," complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi's power extension to all three power files in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"It's a place to strengthen the president's civil society, seriously cancel it," Sa'd complain.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned to the international community, watching the match of ideological fractions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could get revenge.
The demonstrant at Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakphisk: Most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the mystery of the success of the country be associated with the local appetite for the extremely fragraving fish?
Take a few red-eyed cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet soccer equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you get the scent paralyzing smell of cancer, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snow, a beautiful view - and there's all the smell in the air.
Racphisk is a salted pstruh fermented in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it is dark and it begins to be cold, Norové start meeting here in Fagernes at the festival dedicated to this as to say the best, the most submerging food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavity," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the course of the festival.
People all around us eat small fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquatic than a carcass," says Havard.
Drink can overtake the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of sushi, which was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when poverty was in Norway, and because there were still no refrigerators, the fish in autumn struck into airproof barrels with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses have undoubtedly poisoned with alcohol.
Just once generations were forced to leave their land and look for work, and they mostly emigrated to the United States.
At the moment, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large number of jobs, high earnings and a wide range of care systems.
The residents of Sweden, an old rival, which has been much richer recently than Norway, flows to the country behind work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, even though the relatively shining part of the Norwegian past.
It belongs to more expensive food on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will make you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and it seems that most people do so.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-hand racist extremist, who killed 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned in opposition.
Instead, the shooting is called "The Event of July 22."
Nors can only hardly believe that one of them was able to brutality and murder in their peaceful land.
The current wealth of Norway lies in the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970 ’ s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says when you're giving plates with a lame rakphisk, our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents a prototype of Norwegian well-being.
We are, as they say, considerable people.
Her English, as well as the English of most people here, is absolutely great.
We don't give up, we don't like the vocabulary.
Norway is very careful with its oil riches - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to the world's financial crack, they had no money, the Norwegians had strings tightly stuck on their sleeves.
"When we can ski in the winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he delivers with careless laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in the front for something to eat. I've had enough cancer.
Such a lot of burger's definitely something else, and he's beautifully juicy.
But tonight's a stinky fish here again.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where the rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most difficult fish.
They have a connection with a live television transmission where a butterfly moderator is surrounded by plates of cancer.
It's like Eurovision's singing contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"This is our score, Havard."
It's called applause and laughter.
A man will fall out of the chair, maybe soiled with aquatic.
Or maybe the vapours of all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take over the office, Will Grant of the BBC is looking at the challenges they face and the mixed expectations of its fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is stuck even in the best times, steel barriers were raised closing several key routes to the capital and causing the roads of chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent arriving in order to get to work, but to prevent protesters from approaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's shrimp and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
At the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has led well, but the country is in the chains of the drug war, which has already been estimated to be the victim of 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told the American President Barack Obama at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking his hands with the American president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are different in his old home, folkly and vast state surrounding the capital.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in goodness.
Citizens acknowledge the development of tourism in the aeroplane and the construction of infrastructure.
You can travel to the city now on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the pathways that have been here before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect to bring a real and permanent change," says the friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernandez, the State Member of President Pen Niet, the Party of the Institutional Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country needs so much.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
The messenger Olver admits that after 12 years beyond the presidential palace Los Pinos, many expect many are expected within the side of Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he refuses to express the opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He's a very straightforward man, very interested in the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great stateman, and he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people have from their former governor.
In the Unhualcoyotle, also known as Ciudad Nie, cannot be the contrast with the lens of Valle del Bravo streets more evident.
It is placed under the highway crossings in many reminiscent of the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And problems in the municipal community are also endurance and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help manage the drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially stunning is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, there were dozens of murdered women thrown away in empty places next to the massive dumplings of waste.
At the time when Pena Nieto was Governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, which is much more than the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous for the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the criticism of Pen Niet says that in his work in the office, he failed to deal with the problem of women's murders.
And in a worse case, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for the lost neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna, and suppresses the crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone washed her body," she recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of punches on him and after death, there was already a stiffness.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is the only word: "Right."
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they were awarded.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a puppet.
They just want you to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and forgetting," he says.
The Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime and the new president promised that for the time of his work in the office, they will be his priority.
"I hope he's the same president as the governor," says PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning wasn't complaining about bad treatment, said the military prosecutor.
The Military Prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claims on gross custody treatment.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of gross treatment with Manning in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The Military Prosecutor is trying to prove that the army Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest leakage of secret material in the U.S. history, missed many possibilities of complaining about gross treatment that he allegedly suffered in military custody.
At the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, Ashden Fein claimed that the record of the weekly visits that Manning had with unit officers during nine months of Quantico in Virginia showed no complaints about wrong treatment.
The cross-examination which occurred during the hearing on a proposal to reject the case against Manning because of gross treatment at the time of custody, which is sufficiently punished, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of theft of thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the fifth hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through the forms that officers completed after meeting with Manning at Quantico prison, where he was held in a security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that treatment by his guards was "excellent" and total treatment in the facility was considered "very professional".
Formals do not show any complaints about misconduct, even though officers of Manning directly asked how he was treated with him, said Fein.
Manning replied that the concerns of the various problems were expressed orally and that officers who visited him spoke about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but these problems did not.
"They have written "no problems" (after they discussed the concerns) and that did not necessarily mean that I hadn't mentioned them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked why he hadn't complained about his person in January 2011 when meeting the committee assessing suicide ideas that he expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury".
The army said that this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime for suicide) used to protect and secure others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy the higher quality of life, as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning on Thursday witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transported to a prison at the Quantico Marine Corps base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and one day he fainted because of the heat.
He showed that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to be with him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very grumpy.
"My world only stinked at the base of Arifdžán, on the cage," said on Thursday, Manning.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said that after arrival in Quantica he spent most days (at least 21 hours but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, dentists, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying during the day against regulations.
Manning said that he always slept with light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side of the night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint on the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning was also asked about the charges that he raised in the fourth statement about the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guardian and other prisonmates in the morning counting.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to cover his blanket when counting.
On Friday’s interrogation by Judge Manning, he said that, by order of his guards, he had judged that he had a blanket which he could hide, to postpone, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his names to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night his underwear, his names and glasses were removed from his cell.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before the military court, whose beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, he will significantly reduce his punishment.
The defense said that Manning was planning to confess to blame in lower crimes and that he would fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, a military prosecutor is expected to defend the binding conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all arrested in custody with maximum security.
Among the charges raised against Manning are the aid of the enemy, the illegal cause of the publication of the intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My crisis of Mexican-American identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient options there are.
The Mexicans are to be guilty of those who have gone; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely crossed the crowd and arrived in the area for the immigration agenda where I encountered the problem.
The tips pointed to one of the two fronts: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" (the Foreigners).
I stood there a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in high California, and all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy".
So later, I ended up with the name "mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use the shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish enough to handle both sides of this language.
But I don't have a vocabulary of a native spokesman and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood up to the front for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment that the newly elected Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama this week.
On the programme, they had common issues to discuss when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that the Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a business block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced his leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half the Mexican territory in the United States.
But for the Mexicans who think over the centuries, not minutes, they are all the comments.
So one minute after the United States leader says something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and the elite complaint about how Americans intervene in their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are going on a war path.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is to have a relationship with over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
They're a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and defeats, the people of which the earth offers options, and others who are not.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that in some point of our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, weak education, the origin of the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we live an American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the government class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and viewing us as a subtle race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, according to their view, only about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never leave him.
And we would now not be trapped behind a silk tire, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legitly traveled to the United States, reminds me that there's a tension between Mexican and Mexican Americans because the Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel a part of either.
We love to listen to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
In Mexico, he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexican.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "private ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and press on political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and a generously extended corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States as they have dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still feeling annoying for the way their family members have been treated in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The termination of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an insecure base for peace.
Is there ever a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses of who it started, many buildings have been changed into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of the civilians, and six Israelites. And for the first time the missiles from Gaza came near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelites and Palestinians seem to have been trapped in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed old orders and Palestinians and Israel, whether they like it or not, are captured in the future chaos in the region.
Maybe this will cause their fight to be even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that it can interrupt their deadly pathetic situation.
A war that isn't even won or lost.
At first sight, it seems that at present there are no many reasons to optimise.
Even if the stopping of fire closed November 21st, the fights from this week strengthened the bushes on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement in Gaza, will say that they forced Israel to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most pathetic and human corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamás has an influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his enormous rivals from Fatah, more moderate Palestinian fractions.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas can very well judge that time is on their side.
The Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained a greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, resurrected regional power, which was once the nearest Muslim allies of Israel, joined the side of Hamas, and also Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in Gulf.
The people of Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is surrounded by Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the party/million of Hizballah, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly clinging to Islamicism, can settle Bashar Asada, to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And above all, in the southern wing of Israel, he changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursí in Egypt, far the most human and hard Arab country, balance in the region.
The Hustic Mubárak, the secular destate, which ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and his leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israelite supporters of the hard line will come to the opposite conclusions.
Hamas was put back in the box in military terminology.
The Israeli anti-racquet system Iron dome has proved its price and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as reluctant as always. Many European countries also blamed Hamas from the launch of the last round of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanjahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the Gaza missiles have been killed by around 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may once be the Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish settlements that are still growing up despite their injustice against international law.
Prime Minister Netanjah, whose party Likud, at the beginning of the campaign, was connected to a more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those perverted Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they were really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like they did to their countrymen in Gaza?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and hit them when they push their heads out.
The hard line may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not love Israel too much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defence expenses are higher than the expenses of all its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a new war with local superpower barely will help new Arab governments recover their economies.
The fact that President Mursi and President Barack Obama cooperated with him to achieve a stopping fire is a good sign and could mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should look at this situation from a long term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the conspiracy of the rights of Palestinians to self-determine the barrel with a gunpowder that must explode one day in the occupied areas of Israel - as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
The repression has already been weakened in the Jewish state of democracy and the demographic situation is even worsening as the Arab population is growing.
Blood discharges against Gaza, taking place every few years in order to suppress Hamas, they will continue to choose a more diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people are spelling on both sides, most of the outer world, and these newspapers: two states when Israel will pass the territory for safety.
In the short term, there is a little hope that the stopping of fire will give pressures from outside at least a little more influence on the deployment of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to establish a stopping of weapons supply to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of the Jewish State based on the borders of 1967 with the exchange of part of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also press on the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create a Palestinian State.
President Obama also has his work on how to get Israel to the table of action.
He neglected his own peace plan during his first election period.
Now, back in the White House, he seems as rude in his entry into the trial.
That's pathetic, short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means peace settlement between Israel and Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarettes have entered into force
A warning for smokers and sick parts of the body is shown on unexplained green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands.
The Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first species in the world, and the logos and colors of brands replaced the general olive green boxes with disgusting pictures of the sick parts of the body and the view of children and newborns who were ill as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, from Saturdays, the only difference between boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small letter.
This is the most strict system in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by riding this evil habit of his attraction.
It depends on studies that show that if people don't start smoking up to 26 years of age, 99% of the chance they never start smoking.
"Even in very small children, you can see that it understands a message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says the Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes the studies that, for example, have shown that the children are connecting their crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry was hard lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks for this legislation will be serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others say the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, small family companies, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicone for coverage of disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, UK's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeals regarding the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale sales and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible obstacle, experts show the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and there is only this small space to promote your products, there is an inconvincible space for you online, in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in the rating of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "primary Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro's cigarettes and has made this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia argues that the industry focused on how to impose new regulations than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are significantly traded.
The implementation of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Ms. Plibersek says that the government had interviews with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce compulsory warning photographs in 2001.
They now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering more stringent laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"Just pull out a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a picture box in the mouth of a tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to the single box, it is harder for him to balance the shelves.
"It took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should simply ban them completely, then we would say, "OK, that's it, let's close the shop'," he said, and he broke hands.
In the world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
The last day of Thanksgiving, I spent five hours unexpectedly at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half the day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in child development are increasingly boring.
They say that for us (and our children) it is good to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen, we have no chance of getting bored.
So should we support boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to it.
Firstly, as many people I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History of Nude (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, he has a long history of boredom," he said.
There was a Latin sign on the walls in Pompeii regarding boredom, originating in the first century of our year.
And then there's also a question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontaria, Canada.
After looking at research literature and demonstrating the ideas of the target group about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as a experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
The boring is different from the apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no need for apathy to do something.
He says the core of boredom is "the disturbance of the attention process associated with the wrong mood and the feeling of slowly running time."
Boring can remind a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, the boring people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble focusing.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment where participants listened to the tape that person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups have heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others have heard it so quiet that they barely noticed it, while the third group has not heard it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boring than the other two groups - had trouble focusing, but they were not sure why and attributed these boring difficulties.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontaria and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as it's looking for the wrong parts on the factory line, the distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and whining, which is often viewed as a sign of boring, can actually help with boring to fight and keep people physically more observant.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to drill will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom - delays in my flight, screaming speaker, especially a long film.
But some individuals have a better chance to get bored than others.
To help measure nude scientists in the '80s of the last century developed the "Stump for Nausea" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The stamp covers questions like, "Most things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do it all."
Through these scales scientists found that boys tend to bore more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally inadvertent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Social Development at University of Illinois, performed an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found out that 32 percent of the teenagers said they were bored at school and in doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of their parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of the expression of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "supporting is a peak time for boredom", which is largely caused by the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling games or use addicts as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boring and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nude is a way of telling you that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you're bored and using this energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to confuse himself or drive alone, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child can't only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical to her.
Our goal should rather be comfortable when we are from the reach of constant waste of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to bore even more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people actually are looking for is a way to relax and enjoy time.
"In a environment in which we are constantly overcoming," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain when the noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high-school student and a footballer from Southeast Colorada, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and pipes that he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one bright day was with some friends in Lamar on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the policeman found a marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for drug holding and drug use equipment - minor offences for each fine of USD 100 - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalisation of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends rather on the place rather than on the right.
Hundreds of offences for holding marijuana were already here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures, cancelled.
The police department has ceased to blame adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small quantity that will be legally authorised after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative areas of Colorada declared that they would continue with existing marijuana cases, and still accused people of holding.
At the same time, several cities from Denver's suburbs are voting towards the western mountains to prevent the opening of new, the state of licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going on," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are scrubbing regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, either in good or in bad, is first before most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good lead," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State's alcohol sales licences.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There's no real precedent we could follow," he said.
The Washington Law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves the annual vacuum during which there will not be a state licence system, but legal holding yes.
And there are some mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as balanced by the State Directive on "relevant access" to a licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in hemps within 330 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to place a licensed trade in hemp than in the urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Legal Hemp Centre, recently established research groups.
On 21 November, the police chief of Oates from Aurora sent his e-mail officers in which he announced that the city prosecutor would no longer be prosecuting violations for holding a small number of marijuana in every citizen age 21 years old and that the police "with immediate effect" would stop accusing people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will promote urban law regulating medical marijuana growers and that they will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In the district of Weld in North Colorado, the district attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
Following the vote, he declared that his office would continue to prosecute marijuana holding cases, mostly as a way of pushing on users to seek treatment.
At the present time, the charges of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute a criminal offence that was criminal offences at the time of the crime," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction police, the largest town of the county, no longer accused adults of holding a small amount.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to deny all the ongoing holding cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it's changed," he said.
Although 55 percent of the coloradian voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the government's arms and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state have revealed deeply disintegration between local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant of the possession of marijuana, and the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Acts.
"They spent so much part of their life prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first countries that build on a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national testing cases for the legalisation of drugs.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new borders for legalised sales, and at the same time they are looking forward to guidelines from the federal government, which are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will vote.
Despite several arrests of the sellers of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it that attracted attention, the federal government usually left medical marijuana shops in Colorado, Washington and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-draft agents probably won't go out the door to catch a small drug bag, it's likely that they will be able to allow for the state of regulated trades with recreational marijuana authorised by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former advisor in the field of anti-drog policy of President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities don't wait for the federal authorities' procedure.
Even before the day of the election, some local governments have approved the moratoria for any new marijuana trade, even if it will take about a year before any business can open.
Last week, Montrose, in the west of the state, proposed a six-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we give someone a license and then we'll have a big federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this supplement.
We're looking at what the village voted for, compared to what he voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
They're not just being attacked by students today.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my elder brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest knowledge, a modern envied Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the '80s, I went to Worcester College in two weeks, where I wanted to study history, packed my bags, and went into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard said I gave up because I had objections to the love of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson proclaimed I was gone because I was forced to drink from the dumped pots.
The truth was less comic.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidating.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for the only reason, and in this cradle of the supposed enlightenment, it was both big and barbarian: my father, deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly built consultant of Margaret Thatcher and I was the advocate of the Conservative Party.
You can ask me why I'm pulling it right now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students on the right from the middle suffer from a similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so big that last week the group of these students had the same protection of equal rights as gay people, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the association of younger years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claims that because of their political opinions they are "sometimes actively isolated, exhibited by personal attacks and are shown to them that they are not welcome".
They are requesting a position in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to ensure that their views can be communicated freely.
Their situation did not help the recently mentioned documentary TV BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (The Fairy Land: young, intelligent and right-hand) about a student political event that the conservatives looked out as strangers and neonacites.
A graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA), who drove the Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other universities, conservative students say that it is treated with them because of the introduction of a higher educational school as "sacred lambs".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (conservative Association of Nottingham University), said Sunday newspapers that "the cheap influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Twenty-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind a movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant", while the 19-year-old president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that the approach of JCR members to people on the right of the middle has been deteriorated.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and stunningly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the worst.
A year earlier, the university voted against the refusal of the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in the financing of higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinist would be worried.
During the first few days in the introductory week, when the new students meet with the professors, I got to taste the pellets that was supposed to come.
I found out that not only the milk professionals approve the appetite of conservative pupils, but they also like to participate.
The politics of the mining strikes, privatisation and resilience of the government against apartheid sanctions in the Republic of South Africa have been brought into the wood of listeners.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century to English and what followed, I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've had a lot of stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake, was very bullied.
"Thatcheroves refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were hihning.
I had tears drained in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, so if you are not too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a light bubbling on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," said gently.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservative elements pretend they're laborists.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be failing.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (as irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students noted him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love?" asked one.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt like the homosexuals had to feel before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet similarly thoughtful people just after dark?
Would I have to turn into a worker and repress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they developed as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history that was based on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign politics and one of those who write her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for his provinciality and malicherity and for his adherence to the marxistic-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he joined Professor at the University of Bilkent in Turkish Ankara.
"You're not happy here," he told me.
I started to come from Oxford to my parents' house in London looking for refuge with my uninvited metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his study at Oxford in the 40s, all political opinions were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetic.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes have grieved.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted frequent trips to London made my emotional resistance worse.
My friend, also a favourer of the Conservative Party, underwent pressure and gave up his belief.
The next week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in total seriousness declared that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the middle of a cold, I confessed to my "parents wash my brains" and I called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-term.
My Oxford career's graveyard's nailed by my father.
At that time he wrote two columns to Murdoch's papers every week.
My door was locked.
I cried inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my trunk and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a scumbag.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in the education institution.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, not only of which 14 conservative premieres came up, but which, by today, also covers for the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which was launched this week in London, spoke ABC with Naty Abascalová, Fionou Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabela I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentin Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed it in the opening of the glorious retrospective "Valentino: fashion master", which represents more than 130 models of high fashion created by its studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unchangeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of the story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honourable clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until 3 March, overlook private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Chán through the Greek princess of Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the simple tailor from Vogher, north of Italy, on the idol of the international "bothemian smetana".
It's nothing wrong to love the royal families.
"They don't have a bad cigarette stick in a great carpet like they do some beautiful celebrities of pop-music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy generous and elegant.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and the close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelliová or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazz is showing Valentina
The charisma designer doesn't forget even the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been a lot of years since after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome we went to his dinner.
We were 20 and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail his apartment, decoration, food, music, in all things he felt and felt his spirit.
All invited were able to feel important and loving," recalls the top model that began working with him during the Paris week of high fashion in 1995.
"Never comes out of fashion, because his designs are artworks," he ends.
Show of birth
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but a truly reproduced love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset House was converted into an individual 70 meters long passage that offers an exchange of roles: a visitor will turn to a model and march passage to observe the "obecity" of dreams, which is wearing Valentin's masterpiece as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotel Onassis, a costume that was wearing Monica Vitti in "Noc", or a coat of wool and furnace, which belonged to Emperor Farah Dibaová.
In the audience, names Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophie Habsburska.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is the first love, "I can't forget it."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the fall-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' musicians.
"I give him a priority for his femaleity and great love for women, because he underscores our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
"I love the colors that he uses, they make a lot clear and give "sink" faces.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how to wear Valentina for the first time.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full-year-old and had the opportunity to wear one of his night dresses...
She finally waited the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with calls, ordered nuts and a top without a shoulder.
It was a dream that became real," says the widow after Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is overtime," explains the Italian aristocratic, whose life is growing between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'Arenberg has the ceremony of the designer's dress "very carefully... because the dress isn't just dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in them".
The King of Fashion
The golden ridge of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greece in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of elephants with all pearls, twelve types of different edges and a long four and a half meter was needed for four months of work and 25 "holes" (as the designer of his swabler).
According to Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialised press, they represent these dresses the peak mode of the end of the 20th century, the "return of customers from the high society".
Valentino glowed over the years by elite "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest prize in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of the Czech Legia collects so much honor as any of his husbands.
"My attention was always attracted to his choice, peace, well-finished and perfect appearance," says Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him, I saw him at the gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was great. Time left no trace of him."
When the princess says that...
The toughest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the area of volcano Kawah Ijen
Four euros gamble the carriers in the Indonesian volcano with their life and health when they bear 70 kilos of sulphur down on steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and they are the ones who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn live by conquering the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of Indonesian island Jav.
Because of this, every day, they must be struggling to the bottom of the crater, where the gases from the inside of the Earth are avoided and in contact with the air go to a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur that weigh up to 70 kilos together, they carry them on their shoulders in two bamboo baskets on the hard stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters away, but it takes over 40 minutes before the turtle rises up, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps to avoid slipping and failing to collapse.
They know that any confusion could make them life, as it happened to one French tourist who crashed years ago from the Kawah Ijen rocks.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilogram of sulphur that earns
When they're up there, they're taking a road around tourists photographing them, like they're apes in the circus, and they're tired of carrying heavy baskets to the weight that the mine company placed slightly below, at an altitude of 1850 metres above sea level.
This is a PT Candi Ngrimbi company, which has been exploited in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for a kilogram of sulphur.
Then she sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamicity and even whitening sugar.
"Because we normally wear 70 kilos, we make about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each journey," explains Anto, who usually graduates three trips a day.
One way lasts three hours, and at the end it's ruined, but it can make 138,000 rupees (€11.5) a day.
Even if it seems like a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it's three times what he would make in the field.
"The daily salary of the miners is very high here, for example, for the collection of coffee is 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day, and the salary for 14 days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier that previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a meadow.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family to Banyuwangi, village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing as the sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is hinduistic, and I took her to Jacob to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases.
In its 27 years, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur has already taken its tax, although his face is protected by special masks and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing bad, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases that avoid volcano.
That's the price he has to pay for to reach his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open my business or study Spanish or French," promises more than a handsome English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man with destiny could be a tourist guide, a waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of a carrier.
They share a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and get up every day at 2:00 a.m., because the sulphur at night does not stop sulking, and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Despite the darkness, Anto is in the crater and lights his way with a small light that he has attached to the helmet and bought it for his money himself.
Approximately 400 carriers carry on the shoulder basket with sulphur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high income, the mining of the sulphur for cost savings did not limit, nor does it provide self-employed carriers and with such efforts any equipment.
In fact, they don't even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of a surcharge for photography, which together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) picks up natural park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for humans," says Madrusin, a big 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work as long as he can, because he needs money to education his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and stings in the eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and pollutes the miners in dense vapours that come out of the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulder caused by weight baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only charge 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues are in a volcano of 15 tons of sulphur, which then three camouflages take a steak between the shovels to the warehouse in Tamansari with 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik and opens up a wide range of mouths in which several teeth are missing.
From his five sons, you're the oldest, thirty-year-old, he's also earning the bottom of the sulphur.
The time flows, but the constant poverty of one of the most difficult craftsmen in the world continues from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapore states that they don't have children, careers, stress and cost of living and education.
"The homeland of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife, and you're my patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of the advertising for mentol cannons, but still - or maybe that's why - the video has spread massively to YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These phrases are part of the rape that uses the local hits of the "we'll put the chick in the oven" as a laugh of the degree of birth in Singapore.
The BBH Advertising Agency, which created the video, hopes that they can draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artist director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to meet his "civil duty".
"One about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a theme that we had to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things like expanding the perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not completely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing like the rap is to solve the problem."
1,2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too much weight is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 annually to encourage citizens to have more children.
The governmental package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends maternity leave and gives financial benefits.
However, all these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich urban state with advanced technology in the Southeast of Asia, also known for conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the degradation of the population is at the moment 1.2 of the child per woman.
Lastly, the birth rate of 2, which is considered to be the restoration rate in 1976.
Why do Singapore have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage union and family of the National Civil Office, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"So people have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, it is not only a wedding and a family," explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the decommissioning of marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were drastic efforts to increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, there was a misfortune among local inhabitants.
On some singapur web pages, uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the Singapore Government has recorded its worst election outcome since the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, there was an effort to address the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While the decrease in birth rate has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health and immigration policy expenditure, there were also some unexpected consequences in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so little homes.
She, for example, started to influence the real estate business.
The City Development Office has started regulating the number of small flats known as "crabs from shoes", which can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have a area of 46 square meters and had great success in sales.
However, it is fear that these apartments can support young people's lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developer company EL Developers, claims that their "boot boxs" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and they're selling days to weeks faster than houses with a larger area.
That's why our cash flow is much better."
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer rules to developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singapore working in a financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still in stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, that's why many people delay," says a young official.
"The rest have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress and cost of living and education as grounds that prevent them from having children.
So no matter what the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they're anyway Singapore people who have the last word about the family's creation.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal nature or a "the area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance".
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does this definition apply in its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet issues that he would certainly not tell anyone in common communication?
Newspapers from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as a "something completely own" in a personal plane and as a "user name and password", if it was a social network.
"My greatest secret would not be published," says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"On the FB I give nice photos or pictures of how we play.
I'm talking to some friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a picture that wouldn't be mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photos of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends that he has on the FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
There's a mother who has a name and a password of one of the accounts.
"I have set up a Twitter account so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'm just giving them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an unsub's request.
He wouldn't even care if anyone recommends someone unsub.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns the accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his friends list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him on anything, or after him, he didn't want an address or a phone number.
"If they insist on me or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José volunteered to Ask after he read his Twitter recommendation.
These boys are not foreign experiences with what is called cyberbullying today.
"They blackmailed a friend in the social network.
They threatened him and asked him for money.
He never knew who he was," he confirms.
The victim didn't sign out of the account, according to José.
"Only, she activated her private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps, how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photographs of people in some uncomfortable or awkward situations.
"Of course I'd do it if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents in social networks must understand that the main objective of these networks is to be informed.
It states that "Internet was created as a means to seek information, but when the social networks appeared, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a pedagogic graduate at Yale University and the author of the article Digital nationals and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital nationals are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who must learn them, and yet we are just learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complicated theme, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at the age when they are not mature."
Also, to be - about the surroundings - considerable, at a time when what he desires most is to be popular, have thousands of friends and do not think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way for children and adolescents to show what privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras also lists some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or, would you like it if someone published your picture the way you published your friend?
You know what the others say about you?
When you're labeling people in the celebration photos, did you ask these people to be allowed?
And one more thing: do everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment as much as it does outside it.
They're the same rules.
"The man is outside the Internet with respect, moral and other principles, and it should be on social networks," says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, teacher at first level and educational adviser explains that it is necessary that parents of children read carefully the social networks.
"If they understand every dishonest, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences that he can have on the Internet.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "no talk to strangers".
The South America Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without having been issued a statement from Lima, which was commissioned and which was allegedly signed by seven current presidents.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Offices who have established at the beginning that the document will be published after the end of the summit, said that it will be published later on the website of the Peruvian Government.
They also stated that the content was published by the Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Newspapers had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, video from the Presidential Assembly was transferred from the press room without sound with the report "confidential meetings, audio transmission forbidden".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present, but not to the Peruvian speaker.
The only document published during the negotiations was the list of participants in the presidents, which created hundreds of journalists from different national and international media that asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent to the media an e-mail with a "concluding statement" from the summit, but it was only the expression of President Humala, and not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and was not originally promising the Statement from Lima, even though the press was required.
On the official ASPA pages, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were broadcasted, but completely prevented the input of information.
The Summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment from Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court, which deals with a dispute on the border between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollant Humal and President of Chile Sebastián Piñer gathered during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in Hague, which will begin to discuss the dispute against Lima against Santiagu on Monday by hearing the defence speech of both parties.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will solve the dispute we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humala, along with our Chinese counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be the country respecting international law, peace resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñer and greet President Humal with a hand press on the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Columbia adopted this week the Bogot Pact, thereby expressing its submission with the judgments of the international court, which decided on the maritime borders with Nikaragua, and Colombia considered this decision entirely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of Brazil Presidents (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organization in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollant Humal was entrusted with early speeches and by the end of the Lima summit shortly after the fall.
The President read the final document in which 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects between South American countries have been planned, with investments of 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements adopted, it noted that the UNASUR Member States will take "important steps towards the objectives of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended".
He informed that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in combating civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to the common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in the crisis, "he has no economic consolidation (Latin America) of the victorious nature, but is to serve to extend our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transportation of different locations of South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic links," said the Peruvian President.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its cross-country axes from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to better connection with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American nations" from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to continue to remain prosperous and peaceful areas that are complete and have good neighbourhood relations.
In that sense, the Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in a regional meeting that he hopes that on Saturday, in Mexico, he will meet his nickagian counterpart Daniel Ortegou to discuss the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute that is questioned by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortegou tomorrow (saturday)" said Santos.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nikaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I will be able to tell President Ortethus to conduct negotiations with the most civilized and most intimate form," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to attend the inauguration of the President Enrique Peñi Niety.
In the framework of the summit, EU Defence Ministers have prematurely gathered to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the field's defence.
The members of UNASUR shall be Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
The Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "the South America, in this case really, must teach from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the sixth Presidential Summit of the United Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on State TV Perou, that Europeans "killed in World War 2" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of the creation of South American citizenship that the Unasur Member States support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place between the members of the Andean Community, but there are still returning areas that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President, among other things, expressed that he agreed to regroup the United States (OAS) provided that the influence of the Anglosa States will be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
"We South Americans will never commit themselves to anything, and we will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is financed by the United States in Washington," said in the risk of political asylum provided by Ecuador by the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because I did not disregard his principles and respected his " deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "the reasonful suspicion that Assange could be released to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish Justice, which asked him to question in the Swedish territory because of alleged sexual delicacies, while "own Swedish legislation enables it to take place through a videoconferencing call that could take place from the Equatorian Embassy in London".
Correa said that there is a risk that there will be worsening physical and mental health in Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since the moment that's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had minor pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said the Equatorian head of the state.
"But his physical and mental condition is going to get worse because it's locked in a small space without moving on fresh air.
That would mean everyone's health," he added.
The President Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange as of June at the Estonian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that London had been interviewed in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but conversations have been ongoing all the time.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances," said.
He said, "If the UK releases a pass tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden, Mr Assange, hears at the Equatorial Embassy in London or through Skype, how this, without a problem, allows the legislation there, and as it has been done in other cases, this problem will be over tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of the freedom of the press, and to clarify that he certainly does not tolerate "priority, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of free press are not us, underlying and perverting politicians, but bad journalists in profit, pressure and extortion services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy on the fact that even such journalists, "not even bankers, nor hegemonite countries, nor the buržoasia do not control Ecuador", and said that if it was re-election, "will continue to change the correct path and the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay as regards the Unasur membership in the Union at least to its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and tolerate oportunism and puchism covered in legality" because in fact "destructed the legitimacy of paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered "to be absolutely appropriate" of the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nikaragua on sea borders between the two countries now, in the time of the judgment of the International Court in Hague, which decided in favour of Nikaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be evaluated widely to be overcome and the possibility to go forward."
He also expressed the hope to settle the dispute on the maritime border, which is addressed by the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek an international instance if both countries consider to take a judgment, whatever it is hard."
With regard to the possibility that he will be running in the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to treat the third mandate in order, he notes that he perceives this option "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"In person, I was never interested in the power, but the unfair situation such as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be repaired by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I'm going to be the same.
I've made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new health treatment of President Huga Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Madur, who says President Chávez left for a routine treatment planned and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign was over.
This is not a recurrence in the state of the President's health," explained.
The head of the Equatorian State today took part in the Sixth State Heads Summit and the Governments of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was terminated with calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are due to late diagnosis today.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of his test: HIV positive.
"It was like a lightning hitting me," he says in the memories of the moment of truth that the doctor tried to "a bit of soften up," but clearly without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his disease on his own beards, and he started to inform himself about it, with such an assumption that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most important HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came to in 1994 after several fears of diseases.
Fabrizio has been living with a virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years of age, which was something inconspicuous at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and larger stigma.
That's when the Clinic Director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) didn't say good-bye because he had a cut wound.
That's when having AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their disease and lose until the virus caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the length of the patient's life, which starts with treatment in time and appropriately, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of the HIV Unit in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital, with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva has explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed, while those who do not use drugs are better: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
It simply means that whoever is HIV diagnosed in 25 years can, according to these findings, "in compliance with treatment, live without problems up to 75 years", the doctor explained in the interview.
It is appropriate to point out that the average life duration of the Mexicans today is 76 years old.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UN Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS – UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients died since AIDS was discovered.
Only in the state of Jalisco died 255 people in 2011 and until this May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals is ensured.
Why are people still dying of the consequences of the disease?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
This is how I see it. This is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted medical supplies. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or in a late stage of disease."
He adds convincing data: "9 out of ten patients are coming when some associated infections are already shown. All we need to do is to influence overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore, on a large scale, it is necessary to offer tests to detect disease to all persons who request them."
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for Diseases in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to make tests for a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he has already propagated AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, cancer disease, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm supposed to die, I'd rather get out three times a week," they say, but it's not my case.
Change was for better, healthy food, practicing, taking medication."
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, traveling, I lead an active sex life, but responsiblely, I keep an eye on myself and on the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate my testimony to those who are afraid today within the World Day of AIDS.
"If they've been risked, it's better if they're HIV positive, and if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a large gap between health programmes and common citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadalayarian journalist, finding out information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that devoted this task, "that really increased the distribution of condoms, they gave us one or two before, today give us packets and hundred condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," said.
The most vulnerable to new diseases are teenage.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and assessments from social workers, school advisers, staff of curators and medical staff that adolescents want to avoid, says the reporter.
He suggested this ineffective distribution to change, so the condoms are not just behind the counters, but the hundred in the dosages in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about 'paying beer and a motel' as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to split the conservatives in his district.
It's best to make the condoms to those who already run sex life," he said.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 HIV cases) have been reported.
This condition means the fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the disease is on a sexual pathway, 6% of the blood route of y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who don't know about the disease on one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt as set out in the competition in Mexico, creates a miserable precedent for any national business with branches in the neighbouring country and a problem of solvency.
Thus, it appears that the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws, in the country of stripes and stars do not apply despite international agreements.
Approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Halem at the Blackmail Court for North Texas leaves the Mexican company in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the second shore of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican manufacturer of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against three irregularities.
In the initial case, it should be said that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to follow the insolvency law of the United States, the appealing court of the fifth period with its registered office in New Orleans says that the main procedure is to establish a audit procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolation of transnational enterprises.
In principle, the United Nations' model law was established for this purpose to unite international trade law, which determines the organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the branches from the internal business structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro against the branches is recognised, the required majority would not be achieved to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility of Mexican law accepts this option.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first to accept this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Infrastructure Institution guaranteed the debts.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors who stood against Vitro in the United States, i.e. "sup", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, did not reach most.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This statement is not taken into account by the appeal court.
From another point of view, the Court blames Vitro from the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - to the background of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company Gonzáleze Sady will appeal for a new assessment directly in the appeal court to carry out an assessment for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy to revise the process of a higher instance, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The case is serious that the court has omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae department, in which it is described in detail the Vitro procedure under the Concurrence Act, and in which it points out that the company has made it easier by inclined to agreements signed by both countries to confront the Act with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, these are the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: the penalty for Vitro and the State.
Overall evaluation
Without notice, the criminal notification of the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of the company Gaston Azcárrag Andrade, which was claimed from fraudulent negotiations, and according to the professional organization of the pilots, the vessel has already fleeted.
The head of Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit to the National Bank Commission and to the Commission for valuable papers accused of the obstruction of achieving justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to submit reports to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this business, with 198 million pesos selected from IXE from the Fideikomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation.
The products were probably directed to purchase shares Professional hotel management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As known, Azcárraga Andrade is a major shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Dressing Dragon Martha
In the Universidad de Caribe area, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of a association in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from the "land with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a living zone for employees from 150 companies in the bottom part.
The Canacintra Organisation (Camaara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has already managed to unite the Governors of the Southeast Zone to oppose a monumental area that would in part destruct the protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which was not taken into account by the Government and which requested an explanation under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador of the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known under the English short of ACTA, under the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial) has ceased to exist.
As it was known, despite the fact that the Chamber itself ruled out the possibility to consider it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long-term horizon
In trying to repay long-term debts and not affect the short-term development company Homex puts investment certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of the four identicals that offer reimbursement of interest every 28 days.
The Competition is born
The leading companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet were born associations with the trade name Competival, whose aim is to market software services in Central and South America.
Investments in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketbal was my life"
The Basketball World Timer Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been involved with this sal sport for over 60 years and has been traveling through the whole world.
Not many people in Puerto Rico have so many memories of the history of local basketball like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes had been involved in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a junior category player, a national basketball league player BSN, the owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rico basketball federation.
"I held a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including a few at the same time as in the 1990s I was president of the National League of BSN, the General Counselor of the National Team and the Chairman of the Federation," Reyes recalled visiting the newspaper reporters of Primer Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel for over 50 years, his faithful wife.
"Basketbal was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and memorial objects from his long career, prove that.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest move from all guards, those that remind him of his activities in the los Vaqueros since the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, I had the most enjoyed because I had the opportunity to attend eight championships with the los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a number of successful flights, including five champions held in the years 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one champion in 1981 when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, which was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was here before, was a coach, and then he worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown-up two-foot player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me the Raymond Gausse player who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon a victory in the championship, Gausse will contribute to the next."
The champion, when he played Gausse for the Los Vaqueros team, but he had a long time, because in 1988 he was already performing the function of the president of the basketball federation.
At that time he wanted to pay full attention to his functions and enjoy Mincy's location in the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic game in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world championship came in 1990, where we ended up in quarters, but we should have the bronze not to be the Canadian arbitrator who let us repeat the final throwing," Reyes said.
Is the world championship man in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team in Olympiad in 2004.
But my favorit was a national team in the Panameric Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we ripped out the U.S. manhood, which was quite similar to the one that blew our bronze into the world championship.
This manhood had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculine" (Ortiz), but there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 for knee injury.
A man who may not have had a perfect composition, but he managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a man of the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentina Neuquen.
With the players on the rival, such as the "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and Junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded because of the fights in the Pan-American games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
How was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has reached at this level such results as Piculin.
Not to mention his activity in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best portor coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of the young people, Leo Arilla.
What is your success in the Federation as the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national manhood in 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s the national league of BSN in one season to 17 males.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to set up as the distribution of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I can also see the benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, judges' assistants and arbitrators.
Nice to meet you.
What are you doing now?
The most I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos from my time, I enjoy grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course, I'm enjoying my wife Isabel's company, which was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was worldly famous by the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he was embodied by a man who acted recklessly and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the precious petroleum magnate J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series, became a symbol of lacquer in the '80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series of Dallas, died according to the official notification of the family, which the Associated Press Agency provided the production company Dallasu Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon to complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked to play again," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in the Dallas hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he was drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, his liver found a nasty tumor and Hagman had a transplant.
Years before the broadcast of the Dallas show, Hagman was famous as a decent guy in a relaxed comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcasting the NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the figure of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl that Barbara Eden plays, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedys, which were only broadcast shortly, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His role in films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly reluctant J.R., who led him to the star peak.
The CBS Dramatic series on the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propagating slogan "Who shot Jayear?" who was supposed to cause expectations about the work of full emotion, when Hangman's figure was almost murdered, caused not only a huge range of speculation of viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in the stakes offices.
This also helped to achieve a record of observation.
On average, the 1980 November, in which the answer was revealed, was observed by 41 million television viewers. Dallas thus became the second most observable entertainment series of history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million viewers.
At J.R., his sister-in-law Kristin fired.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened her to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable champagne with a charismatic smile: an inspiring entrepreneur and an infidel husband who tried to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic woman, locked into a treatment.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be, "There's an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered on Friday at Hagman as someone who was "great on canvas and outside it."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirable people in the world and in the hearts of all of us who had the happiness of knowing him and loving him.
Ten parts of the new series of Dallas broadcast the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The film of five parts of the second row has been completed and the sixth was just spinning," said the television station.
Right after Hangman's death there was no statement from Warner or TNT station on how the show would continue.
The family of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she was born to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the '50s, Larry tried the luck of the theatre scenes in New York, and then in 1952 to 1956 he served in England in the air force.
That's where he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, who he married.
The married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities stayed.
In 2001 he published an autobiography book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could hurt anyone or somehow harm him," said Agent Prensa Asociada.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital where he helped fighter patients.
"I advise them, deliver courage, meet them when they go to surgery and then," said 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in combating smoking and taking part in various campaigns.
It begins the course that explores the end of the world.
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would do a course about the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar to come on December 21st, many people caught as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he was waiting for in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budgetary spread, which some called "long Armageddon", and the growing conflict into which Israel is dragged into, a place where Christians in theoretizing the end of the world will begin with the Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told the students of Rutgers University this week in Camden, New Jersey.
When a man takes care of what's going on in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, the bad means good for the apocalyptic thoughts.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses about the end of the world in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, an expert assistant Barry Vacker is hosting a course of "Industrials, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We find why these thoughts are expanding in time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that run certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material reaches into the hands of terrorists, war may go off.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic topics and study how they differ from real life examples.
"I've been trying to inform students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker says.
At the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history of Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solariová, expert assistant of art history and anthropology to organize a course with simple name End of the world.
"We don't connect "2012", because we always count on the possibility to organize the course again if the world does not end," Restall said.
Despite "threatening destruction," students must study, create projects and do final tests.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place in the Apocalypse evening, which gives students no choice but to work "up until the foreseeable end of the world" said Restall.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He spread in two hours," Restall said about his high-price course for students who signed up 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mail questions about whether there was a place.
The students themselves make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said at the Rutgers University of Camden, 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
So apocalyptic, worldly or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursery student, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no pronounced student, let alone the professor, didn't say he believed in the date of the end of December 21st.
"Our first project was discussing the Mayan prediction, and in a certain way we will disrupt it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans have never foretold the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which reaches a few centuries back, which people respond to the change of their surroundings by forecasting the end of the world.
The blooming of these speculations caused the internet.
"The people don't think about it," he said.
It's happening in the whole majority of the English language world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about a course on the end of the world, he answered quickly.
"The Philistines are not participating in the end of the world," wrote and suggested an exception to the highest office.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that during the years it was talked about many days of the last court, and said if nothing happened on 21 December, "the people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosopher that December 21st is the beginning of the seventh period at which the world will disappear.
The date is taken at light weight by students and professors.
Several of them said they were going to go to the end of the world.
"I think I'll call some friends to laugh together," explains the 20-year-old student of Samira Ford's communication.
