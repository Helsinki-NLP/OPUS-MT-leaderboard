Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefiting of Colored People (NAACP) has published a warning for the colorful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discrimination principles of the state and racist attacks.
‘The NAACP Travel Recommendation for Missouri State, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and inhabitants of Missouri to take greater attention in travel across the State due to a series of contested racial motivated incidents that are currently occurring throughout the State,’ stands in the statement of the Association.
The NAACP has argued that this step has taken place on the basis of the current law of the State of Missouri, which hinders the defence of racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as in the light of the actions of the authorities active in criminal proceedings which are inappropriately targeting minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by cops only because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," said the president of NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel for Kansas City Star.
"We have the biggest complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued for the US State.
Among the incidents that the organization quoted were racially motivated abuses directed towards the students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in spore circumstances at the beginning of this year after he got out of gas travel across the state, and the police put him in custody without accusation of committing crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent State Supreme State Prosecutor State of Missouri statement that black skin drivers have a 75% higher chance to stop them.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and to warn their families, friends and collaborators against what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay bail, or to alert their relatives to travel by the state.”
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme, there was a hundred cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, which brings the state to the 16th place among all states.
At the same time, the travel warning is a response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it easier to sue the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) has issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizon after the States have approved the immigration law, which enables the State to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law which, according to ACLU, is to improve the racial profile.
The travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Countries, but lately the advocating groups have taken action in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family has no peace after 12 years!
The murdered model is Sally Anne Bowman.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant she worked in, he planted her stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, eventually killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a cautious crime work to look at the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was convicted in 2008 to deprive freedom of 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
He only admitted a juvenile assault in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found a dead girl lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie said that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"She also attracted attention to the taxi driver," he said to a liar.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, though, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stabbed her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven as a lie and charged him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his hornyness and flavor after a girl.
When he dressed her up after sex, he felt happy, and he had to burn the marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, said that himself to the police, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, which is why he attacked her from behind and put her hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after 12 years, the family faces other attacks by the vandals destroying her grave.
In the last six months, he was damaged four times.
There are such cruel people in freedom who dig out these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of the dead girl Linda information about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrator costs dozens of thousands.
"Course are not prude or conservative," says Martin Ráž, which operates the Prague Intimity boutique.
In it you can find design and luxury erotic tools.
Including the Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started incredibly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Rage and his friends went on a cycle trip after Moravia.
One of them didn't only bring a bike, but also a box full of indifferent vibrators.
"Various croissants and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with the German design producer of Fun Factory, which was interested in Martina, and he offered to assist with marketing.
When the companion left to take care of another profession, he replaced him.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street butik Intimity, where it sells erotic aids in the way they are normally offered luxury purse or shoes.
Why wouldn't he?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, do you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such a puritans!
Just the Berlin Fun Factory trade, which was designed by a recognized designer Karim Rashid, served for the butik Intimity as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone here used to.
No covered window, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed more than in perfumeries.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek Šebelka began to think about how to take the Prague business where he should be and how he should name himself.
Intimity's name was liked by both.
"Intimately, it is related, and it is, it is, you can say, delicate," he says.
Followed the purchase of the Internet domain and the search for suitable space, which went parallel to various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, she won the variant that spread the shop into the garden of delight and the bedroom, the duke of the bed.
Dagmar Štěpán made it up for us from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
First, he didn't seem perfect because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting on the name of Intimity again.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main, so no one's looking at the customers," he commends Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with brandy nice goods, in a place where women, which are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not that they're ashamed of entering such a store at all.
When I walked into the Intimity Boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to an erotic aid store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior that I know from the fashion boutiques.
Even though there's only a woman's service in the shop, it doesn't mean that the male foot would not be welcomed here.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Music usually can't estimate the right size and chooses more," smiling Martin over a lot of mistakes.
These are those prejudices, those intense clichés that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men usually choose black laundry, while a woman usually stretches to a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a bad product called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touch-free clitoris stimulator.
I have a teenage need for admiration of what a serious tone is given to me.
It's like it doesn't fail.
And it doesn't really happen.
It's at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well-accepted.
It's about the last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He cared for women to be more interested in the design of such products.
The other was the vibrator for the We-Vibe couples.
He completely broke the taboo, which may persist in some men, and that in erotic aids he sees competition.
"They do different variants," it continues.
With one engine, two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
With love connection, a woman can have a controlr in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain fall is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least it's with us.
The Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose tools and buy classic vibrators, even though they need to use it exteriorly.
But in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would only work for men.
It'd have to be a little different.
The question is, what to offer men is," Martin thinks.
"We also have help for them, but to a limited extent." Most are sold mainly by a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomic vagina imitation, but "speed as a shower gel or as egg or futuristic object.
He's very focused on function and experiences in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me astonishing.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot of erotic aid, I suggest.
"This is the Internet reality," explained.
The usual is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are rather linked to using women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are a board for women."Just for interestingness - what the Japanese Tenga brand is represented in the Intimity Boutique sells worldwide, is still about half of what will be sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and Czechs aren't very prude.
On the contrary, we're all a good nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years and "he has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
She comes to get something nice, more quality, what she would complete with her partner life, or for her own." Martin Rage and her business partner Zdenka Shebelka are looking to see if they are perfectly functional for each product.
We also don't want to go into bondage and latex specialties, because we don't have space for it, but it's not fit to be here.
Such things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are the people who always had an axe to go to the sex shop because they were afraid to look at them like that.
A lot of products exposed on the shelves are actually kissing.
This is also given by the selection of renowned brands.
Some even won design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was the mentioned sea horse "and it triggered a change in the whole sector.
It started dropping from cheap materials and, on the contrary, working with healthless, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that some are behind the design of the Czech Republic, although popular designer Anna Marešová.
I must say, I'm quite surprised how many people have the design stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mareš buys, even though they're relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus' balls from Anna Mares.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can do differently, nicely, with a story.
Ann's story started as a school job.
Now it's a finished product, which is also produced for us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a big product, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
I may go against the current, but it seems important to keep developments in the Czech Republic.
It could be possible that in a few years, we will not be able to produce anything anymore," describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin, that our company is getting more open.
He does not meet with a negative or denial attitude.
They're supposed to be distracted.
"But even they start smiling." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator offer that you can make a personal message on, and she also plans her own lubricating gel this year.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should come.
The borders of healthy sex
I wonder where the boundary of what's okay is.
Is there anything Martin Rage would never sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What happens to one person is normal, another may seem totally unormous, so we are more defined by a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them are letting into some extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the most crazy demand they got?
Right now, the e-mail came in a week where some lady asked for a masturbating aid for her friend with a long, 20 centimeters in nature.
Then we had to write that one, unfortunately, we didn't have anything like that.
The question is, if any of us didn't make fun of us," Martin's measuring me with a suspicious look.
Even that happens from time to time...
A shot for Karl Gott.
Two Alzheimer cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals all the memories from people.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," said the singer himself the sad news of Lightning.
I know about my disease, and so far, I can handle it quite as far as I'm concerned.
"I take medications that have accompanying phenomena to slow down," he added that he thanked the closest for support.
The whole sophisticated family has come to make it easier for Karl's life.
Eva's wife is trying to be home as much as possible, and the daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, the son of Karel, spoken by Karlas, comes home to her father.
Fortunate fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavík to support him in his challenging treatment.
He's got 60 chemo.
He was able to get back to work on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have been foretold from the astrologer to be here until 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
With the same disease, the actress of Flower Fial is now fighting in the constitution.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer in your family?
See how to treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has abolished the ban on interference, the law shall assess the USS.
In Chile, the absolute prohibition of artificial pregnancy interruption is still valid, therefore, not for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators lodged a complaint against the Constitutional Court and that ten people would now decide what we had argued about in Parliament for more than two years," she complained to socialist senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August should be given a new chairman, which, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law breaking the absolute ban on interference, initiated by the current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on July 19th.
The right opposition then announced that the law would attack in court because it believes that it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
The Members have postponed the vote on the bill last month until the mixed parliamentary committee has been analysed.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and again made the Senate after them.
According to the new legislation, a criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy should be stopped in three cases: if the life of a woman is at risk if the fetus does not have hope for survival, or if pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter of El País in Chile since 1931, that is, before the women had been given the election law in 1949.
The absolute ban on interference in 1989 introduced the right dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where the absolute prohibition of interference applies.
Other include Nikaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador is now behind bars of about 20 women who are taking up up to 30 years of imprisonment during the interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, the defenders of human rights claimed a spontaneous abortion, which the court claimed to be murdered.
Is there anything else sacred?
The destination of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Freedom
The criticism of the statue is a miraculous sign of the change of mode.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully inspired downcast of the statue of Saddam Husajn at the Firdos Palace in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key supporters, surely knew what he was going on when he had a passionate debate with the CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of president's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants with a symbolic axe on the Freedom Soch.
It's nice to say Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, a crowd of owners of cruise boats and imitators of the Statue of Freedom would lynch him.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 the plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the suburb, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller replied to Acostus: “I do not want to go into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that casts light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the heel additionally, and which you refer to is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, this isn't about history.
These are mainly the stunning words of Emmy Lazarus, which are now resonating - he invites them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: “Let me go, who drops, the poor who barely breathe freely, who can with the poor worm in the midst of cities."
And in modern times, we can watch these “wretched worms” on our screens better than ever.
Miller was not trying to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of the extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict of importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death tried to set up posters with poems on a stamp of statue, knew well that he was going into a high political game.
The statue was supposed to express the merger of the French and American Republican government by representing a classic topic, i.e. women's embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem there is no female character abstract, but has its own voice.
He also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The combination of poems with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right believers long try to reverse this meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptist in Trump’s coming to power - argued in 2010 that the Freedom Statue does not really invite anyone to the ground, but represents an early unconstructionism, bringing the American flame to the world: “Soch of Freedom runs forward.
It brings a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Limbaugh is amazingly attacking an important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger, who often after a long and frightening cruise across the ocean comes with hope in the heart into a new country.
It is literally a view of the world with the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue of hope expresses and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that Miller and Trump will definitely not recognise.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championships at theatre of 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom athletic Federation, Neil Black, said that the powerful 16 Scottish Scots in the World Championship team will be a "great benefit for the team".
For MS in London 2017, which begins on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that in Scotland “something is happening” and the British athletics could learn from Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
“I was talking to people from the Scottish Sport Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Directors think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
That's what people in the streets think, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
“A few athletes, whether the Scottish or athletes of other nations, came out of the room with a feeling of great pride and motivation.
The passion and the unscrupulous feelings Eilidh spoke with were unrepetitive."
A silver medallist of Commonwealth, who will compete in running over obstacles to 400 m on her fifth world championship, said that it is “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The highway runner Muir only set five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in running at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. This year's season won British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers her first championship where she was the only Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team led to the “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of colleagues had reached the team, but in many cases they will also attack the participation in the finals and the medals.
"I was very honored to be elected as captain of the team, but knowing that members of the team have chosen me is delightful," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who have entered the team.
It proves where I've moved.
They're athletes who're going to think about the front scenes on the stage.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did it.
I just pointed out the fact that we could be proud of this year's championship because it's on the ground.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm gonna enjoy the incredibly atmosphere."
Blocking the critics of Facebook: Do not treat public function if you do not bear the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspaper didn't take long to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political opinions.
Yes, this critique did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to shut the critics up.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and the foolish and the German will be guided as sheep in defeat.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work on to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
Staff of the Governor rejected the action as unjustified, and many of the comments on the Internet appeared as “who cares”.
“It’s just Facebook,” said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially at the moment when they're like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not awkward.
As it is visible, its state manages with its own certainty and strictly respects the principles.
It turns out that it is also vigorous in the use of Facebook as the main means of connection with its voters - except for the publication of the first photograph with the head holy after graduation of chemotherapy.
Blocking the people who call the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his staff paid from taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse defended the Governor that blocking comments took place from the position of moderating contributions.
However, using a picture of online trolls, spamers or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post corresponded to a number of real people who were erasing contributions.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. questioned hate crimes, but her comment was not hated.
"I politely pointed out that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," wrote Washington Post's daily commentary.
"I do not like the idea that once a certain number of people commented on the same subject, some people are referred to as promotion of so-called collective efforts, instead of being regarded as a larger group of citizens concerned."
What the governor's staff called "oriented spam interest" would probably call others "protecting".
Modern Facebook era allows us to manage the posts easily by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It's much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require employees to be sent to the streets, where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism or they would arrest or shut the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public activist to be criticized for the disgrace of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a plea by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first addition in Alexandria, according to the district judge James C. Cacheris, where one of the voters had prevented access to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also met visits from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the low price of mail had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press was four times multiplied and the leader's position questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in times, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents gathered by people under the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions gathered in his office criticising his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they will use more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs will use more of their tariffs abroad than at home.
The most often moves in Austria, but the collection of data in the summer season leads to Croatia.
However, on holidays, they have more time to broush on the web, and under the parasol, they don't usually have the possibility to join the Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use their services at home prices.
It comes from the latest statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the slot than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum nations ride through the winter, the consumption of data increased in this summer season even fifty times.
Italy was then placed in the second place in the database of data consumed.
Most minutes Czechs are calling from Germany, where many of them are going in work and during the summer.
Croatia according to the dates of the Association of Czech travel agencies will visit 800,000 Czech Republic annually, it is our most popular holiday destination.
But people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The recordman was this year's July 7th.
"The data would fit dozens of millions of photographs," stated the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users moves in neighbouring countries.
Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia, first place.
Croatia is up to four and Italy is six.
We're going to Austria to the hiking and active holidays, and we don't have so much time to whistle on the Internet.
"During Austria, Czechs are headed to Adriatic," she explained Cieslar.
While the data recorded by the operator following the release of roaming charges high annual growth, growth is much lower in phoneing.
The number of minutes called for roaming increased to twice last year compared to last year.
Germany is dominated here with a tremendous ahead of other countries.
"Long roaming calls are rather used by corporate customers on work travels," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
In the next three days, Ronan Rafferty's former golf course will be hoping for a comfortable atmosphere in Renaissance Club in the East Lothian Scottish administrative area, which hosts the 25th year of Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who came from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby golf course Archerfield Links on the way to the final, according to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of the ambassador in the representation of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow up slowly in front of me, and this year's tournament will show the world his beauty," Rafferty said.
“ Players will be able to love the first-class quality playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his success.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The English Eales will first defend the master title, despite the fact that during its 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I have a good feeling about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no chance to defend my victory on Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful golf spot.
I remember last year when my wife and I meant a real win for me.
It was beautiful times I will not forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to homeland after celebrating this year's 50-year country.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play in the land," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to be successful while you feel great pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I think I'm good.
I'm happy with the current result."
The three players will also join the former winner of Masters Ian Woosnam and the winners of the senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former captain of Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Check-in is free of charge. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two and more passengers.

Poverty and death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he's rarely using a pelvis.
In its wooden chateau, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotal in the Indonesian province of Papua, the woman usually simply throws sweet potatoes - in the language of local “nota” - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, the potato will remove and enjoy it with unwashed hands.
The Bardina sits on the pale country - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in defected water from nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is filled with a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no field was assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Working in late nighttimes is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"Friday after 5:00, no one will allow themselves to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life in Papua's high school, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 older were forced to vote in the form of a public raise of hands before the occupied army.
The current protest movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakart government, which dominated the whole region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua-New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and devastated city where you can get from Jayapura Province to Nabire after the 90-minute flight.
A massive transport in this place doesn't work.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs from wool sheets in shades of gray and rusty colors.
Only few Indonesians looked at this place, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, local inhabitants worshiped the god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to its colorful, handwritten turban, dark t-shirt and bright dress.
"We used to wear leafs."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and here's child mortality and gravity is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoeenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015, Freeport recovered gold and copper worth $3,1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at a estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these wealthes are a source of suffering for the Pope and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army.
The investigation carried out by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid to local military agents and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The Popes who call for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore hardly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, beaten and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s were equal to the genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Only last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the report of the Brisbane Archiecéze from 2016, describes the cruelty that happened last year, as extra-soudual executions, torture - according to other reports, it is particularly popular rape and execution by electricity - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week," Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch said.
The whole situation has made it difficult for the papanese resources to attract colonists to Indonesia.
From 3.5 million inhabitants of the province here, 83% report to Christianity, but demographics are changing with the flow of Muslim immigrants from Indonesian islands - Javy, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawesi.
The Japanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papaans,” explains the 14-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to Jayapura Province for work.
"Original inhabitants of Papua - Mama-mama (woman) - have lost their job."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is being named Jok, in his presidential campaign in 2014, promised to solve inequality and rights violations.
The former carpenter has secured and his way to the presidential palace in the 27th of the 29th districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But it changed very little in Papua, and local people feel hurt.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he would hear our call for justice," said You.
The fact is, just two months after the October inauguration, Mrs. Jake's suffered a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the camp fire in Enarotaly when two Indonesian motorcycle soldiers appeared from the grave of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers had this enthusiasm and tone, which she had been told, and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers chased a group of children and beat them with their arms, put sacrifices and witnesses.
One of the soldiers fired on a bunch of kids.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strong that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down the nearby building of the Electoral Commission, and the next day, things were still performing.
About 1,000 young papanese men and women gathered at the football field before the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came up with ceremony hunting bows and made a dance for waiter - in which he runs in the circle and imitates the singing of birds - the papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing on stone buildings.
With the tension level, the soldiers were ordered through the radio: “If a crowd attempts to resist at least three times, you have a permit to shoot,” said TIME weekly in an official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremies Kayame (56), head of the district of Enarotal Kego Koto, recognized the threatful danger and invited the inhabitants to go to their homes.
However, no one was negligible to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said TIME on the porch of his pester painted wooden house.
Kayam still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the present soldiers.
“There were a lot of people everywhere, and there was a lot of shooting,” he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was shot three times according to the words of his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I went to the body to convince myself that it was really him," said Yohanes, a sad weekly voice Yohanes, who only uses one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told the journalists that his officers were only "survivors" of the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us to death," said the press spokesman of the papanese police in 2015, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The report on the murders was bewitched by the media on the next day.
Three weeks later, Jok presented a passionate speech in Jayapur and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that he can never repeat himself," he said.
The Minister of National Security of Wiranto announced in October 2016 that it would establish an extra-soud mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, the excuses began to be heard.
“ Most violent acts have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In the interview of 5 June for the weekly TIME, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be prevailed by the court.”
Wiranto, accused the United Nations of "the crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than 1,000 dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua have yet been settled, including an incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his statements with disbelief.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned a total of four times, but I have not waited until now,” said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the sight of many Madame people who are worried about the incident to speak.
According to his words, the members of the army killed him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The fight in which one person died and another 17 was injured was between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in the transport of a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned in fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angered villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the statement, the villagers throwed on their own stones, and their responses were a warning shot.
However, locals claim that a mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting into the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't come out of the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament was required to punish interested police and to withdraw mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the native people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in central high places.
Many of them joined the Papua (OPM) Movement for the liberation of the rebel army, which protects the Papaans' rights by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Koya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and liberally detained thousands of people of Paniai, all under the prerequisite of the “project of national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never be seen.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil in the fire is poor.
That little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals.
And bread is still inexpensible.
The residents here grow their food: especially sweet potatoes, fruit and leave vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them makes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened more airline routes and began to flow to the country, new immigrants have increased economic inequality between the Nazi Papaans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs will normally take more educated and richer immigrants.
Papaans rarely have the necessary capital and education so that they can go into business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages for lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Madamai Tribunal.
Thanks to the isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from the parrot of this year, because of the negligence of cooperation with the authorities, all this despite the fact that they received such a rare permit for filming.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch, Jokowi, in his election campaign, promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and to achieve transparency and development.
“The foreign journalists who work in the rebellious most eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at risk: the lack of visas and the classification of black papers,” said the statement.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in Papui is largely limited.
In March there were six paaciphic nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “the various and widespread violent acts” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir has lost charges when he declared to journalists in Jakarta that: “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media are free, and it is therefore difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people call for foreign governments.
When the official delegations from the Netherlands, headed for the human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, visited the 4th May Jayapurau, local people called by the source that he also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password “we want freedom”.
Other elections are scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the pope says they won't vote Jokowi.
“Joke is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - besides that they live in constant fear of the robbery army - fall into poverty, miserable education and health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of the Madame, as well as the other Papaans, consider their voice to be “debt,” who must repay Jok.
"They don't want money, demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidations of the families of the victims of the paniai shooting continues in the last symbolic act of opposition: they bury the victims' bodies on the property opposite the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not let the responsible persons forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," said Yacobus with his head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy captured a huge cocaine supply to Australia.
The French Navy has detained 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth about $ 256 million in the Pacific yacht.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the intervention, a four-member crew of the ship was arrested, which seems to be the people of Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, came out of South America and the police pulled it to the port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence said that in cooperation with its international partners he would seek to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going, and to reveal the 'litevian syndicate'.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures to stop a large number of drugs headed to Australia," said Col Blanch's Executive Director.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of increasing the number of drug addictions.
The current raid is not the first.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to smuggle through the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
The seniors don't feel thirsty, drinks need to be reminded.
The problem may be at home for seniors, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic, the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlová could be the infusion of a physiological solution that squeezed with a thin needle under the skin.
They are used only in medical facilities so far.
The older man, the more water falls in his body.
"And also loses the feeling of thirsty, so the seniors generally accept less fluids and very quickly dehydrate," said Madlová.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, she often thinks that no doctor is watching.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually addressed by infusion.
"I think that even there should be gradually introduced to get subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, two half-litre bottles of physiological solution may be added to old people.
Lack of fluids can cause minority, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration turns out to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"On one day, the old man will say he can't get out of bed, talks confused," she added.
In case of negligence, it may result in a brain event.
The blood will shrink and wipe the vein in the brain, and the kidney failure is also at risk.
Patients lying should not be covered with a feather, maximum cotton sheet.
The problem may also be one-time diapers.
"It is a nurse more challenging, but it would be ideal for the patient to uncover and let the skin ripen," said the doctor.
In Dubai burned the second marble The Torch
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential marbles appeared in the flames. The firemen had to evacuate all the inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floor buildings.
In the last two years it is already the second fire of this height building, which bears the convenient name The Torch (Torch).
All residents of the building were evacuated and there was no injuries, the cause of the fire was unknown.
“We slept and woke us a alarm. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the marble.
Dubai civilian defense said that firemen managed to get fire under control around 4:00 in the morning (00 GMT) continued to cool the building.
Government leaders have added that they provide spare accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could again initiate discussions on the safety of materials used to circumvent high-sized buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation, which initiated the management of the Torch cloud after the fire in 2015, it appeared that the most damaged the deposition and external panels used to decorate or isolate.
The British police said that the system of insulation and deposition of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, in which nearly 80 people died.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States are carrying prohibited objects on board aircraft
The survey between passengers has demonstrated that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously gave the prohibited objects through the control post of the US Government Transportation Security Administration on board a plane. At least six percent of passengers entered on a plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of the passengers claimed to have later discovered that they traveled with guns, ammunition or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which responded to more than 1,000 questionnaires, it appeared that there was more like a violation of the rules in younger passengers.
From respondents who admitted that they tried to travel consciously with the subject that is prohibited from the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours flying compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
The most common items that escaped TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents consciously gave a sharp object through the security, while 2.2 percent of the women concerned and 3.7 percent of the men in question were also admitted that they intentionally put the drug banned aircraft on board.
The company stated that she carried out research between passengers around the world to find out how many of them randomly delivered unauthorised subjects through airport control and how much they did so on purpose.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel a plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are quite complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can make to the plane.
It is therefore not surprising that TSA confiscated in the largest amount of just forbidden fluids.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would be handling books in the same way as smuggled goods.
The transfer of fluids is permitted within domestic flights, not international flights.
Chief of EPA Scott Pruitt on the deferral of planned directives to reduce the emissions of Obama Administration
After 15 states were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, her boss Scott Pruitt revoked its earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obam's administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within his plan, and he reacts more intensely than the previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last term laid down on 1 October when the States should start to comply with the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of the amount of the ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the agreement would postpone by one year and will provide a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "inferior to local decisions or threatened economic growth".
Pruitt, who served as a reliable opposition to more stringent environmental regulations before the EPA head of President Donald Trump.
Since he settled in Washington Pruitt repeatedly moved or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden medieval turnover is the greatest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA executor exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the integration of the Obam's administration plan, which required the oil and gas companies to reduce the leakage of methane.
In the statement published on Wednesday night Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened EPA's commitment to cooperate with the States through comprehensive processes and implementation of new standards in the given time frame.
“In the former EPA administrations, she often did not fulfil the terms and wait until she was sued by activists and others, agreeing with the settlement and further setting of plans,” Pruitt said, who put more than a dozen lawsuits on the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in the regulation by means of a court dispute and by fulfilling the term we take seriously.
We never joke about our statutes and authority which results from it."
However, in the EPA declaration, Pruitt may at some point use ‘the possibility of delays and all other legally available authority’ in order to ensure that the regulation ‘will be based on healthy policy and the most accessible information’.
The Republicans in the congress are pushing for a wider transposition of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has still not passed by the Senate.
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who was headed by the coalition of the States sued this week by the EPA, said that the group would not authorize in legal pressure.
“The turnover in the opinions of the EPA - following our courtyard over - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Natural ozone arises when normal harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refinery, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths every year.
Advocates of public health and environmentalists welcome Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is disturbing what pressure is needed to be developed to change the thinking of responsible persons and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burdová from the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological intercept of Trump's administration, trying to help pollutants and special interests."
A man's acid polished, yet it's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one point, you're home with your family and you're laughing at each other, suddenly your whole life will change from the foundation.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andrease Christopherose from the Great Britain, whom the face of the unsub attacker, who was eventually discharged by guilt.
The information provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros's.
Andreas raised himself to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door that was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise was waiting for him.
The man he's never seen in his life, right after he opened up without warning, he spilled acid with the words, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was inappropriate.
My clothes fell apart like nothing, and I just felt an incredibly skin pain," Andreas said.
The family quickly transported him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned a terrible report - according to the doctors he had no chance of survival.
A few weeks after the incident, the doctors were constantly concerned that their patient would undergo an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Of 90 percent, the face was hit by the doctors attempted to assemble with the skin from other parts of the patient's body.
The great complications for Christopheros have become a loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most torture thing I've ever seen.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," described your misery.
Today, Christopheros has 12 operations that are far from the last.
Injuries that suffer the victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgery and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after challenging and long-term treatment, the victims of tissue are scarce to the rest of their life.
"Sometimes people are not recovering and fighting deformation and disruption throughout their life," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery.
The attacker's wrong.
As far as the attack is concerned, Christopheros is sure the unsub man must have misled him.
The perpetrator believed that a man who sexually abused his close person was revenge.
The police investigated the case properly and then the attacker tracked it down.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict of Christopher's family's amazement changed substantially.
"Three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be abolished because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks with nutrients has increased considerably.
The Ministry of Interior has expressed its view on the issue that it plans to provide new guidance to the State representatives on the classification of jerseys.
They should be included in dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not intend to give up.
They require the government of Great Britain to enforce more stringent and longer sentences of freedom to people who attack their surroundings with acid or other nutrients.
They also require that strict checks on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often available in different stores, as these are different cleaning means.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates Dubai burned at night the famous marble The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the dubish civil defense, the inhabitants of the 80-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the Dubai Police, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to a few inhabitants of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they said," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to the next tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke in the highest floors and spread down with the fallen hot wrecks.
We were sleeping.
We woke up the alarm, people screamed.
"We went down the stairs, it took us from the 50th floor of about ten minutes," said George's tenant.
Another of the CNN witnesses estimated the flames of about 40 apartments.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to civilian defense communication, the fire managed to get under control.
The reason for his creation is not yet known.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power's out.
The large fire damaged the dubaiian marble The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred flats.
There's about 680 flats in the whole building.
No one did anything at that time, for the people were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 meters the highest residential building of the world.
The record was prepared by another dubish marble next year.
Culturalist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, there was a varied collection of unauthorised resources - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically or this wild mix didn't help him to title, ended fourth.
Culturalist now threatens the four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian ragbista David Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which until then was a record of the number of adhered athletes.
A third-ligian player started taking steroids a year before he fell through culture.
Lucka Vondráčková in Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-lover!
Lucka Vondráková has barely stepped in the Czech territory, is in one round.
And he also draws attention wherever he comes.
She last fell into her arms, her ex-lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for his family.
Lucia was only 19 years old, and she certainly didn't want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went apart, but friends remained today.
Which also proved at the press conference of TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
The coincidence was both aligned to the blue color.
First they didn't notice each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she fell behind her belly.
Then they hugged each other, and the photographers were willing to pose.
But their meeting was not a coincidence, because they're going to play a lover couple in a new series of Prime Minister Exner.
The Islamists have been given life in Great Britain for the preparation of the assassination.
The British Court sent four members of the Islamic cell to life on Thursday, who called himself the Three Musketeers and planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were already sentenced for similar deeds, were arrested last August.
The authorities thought that he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partly finished tube bomb, knives with signs in Arabic that mean "unbelievers", and a gun maker.
It happened at the moment that MI5's secret service agent puts the device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what horror the defendants might have caused if they were not stopped," said the Deputy Attorney Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict who is 38 years old can do after 15 years behind bars.
The men during the process in London declared they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed by an MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then rejected the defendants.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodonsk.
Tuesday temperature record 37.3 degrees Celsia remained on the top of only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, recorded in the Watchtower in Hodonin, he survived it on Thursday, which thus became the warmest day this year.
This was confirmed by workers of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
Apart from Tuesday, there were no many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, the records were overcome or settled to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years.
On Thursday only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
Like the Watchtower, the fourth temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclavsk of quarterly 37.4 degrees, the original maximum of four ten degrees exceeded and in Pohoříce in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tens.
Both records, just like the Watchtower, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared in the south and the east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Guardian was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyjí in Brzeclavsk, where rtumbly climbed at 37.8 degrees, but the record didn't cross.
On the other hand, for example, in the western and northwest Bohemia, the ČHMÚ’s website was only around 22 degrees Celsia.
"The heaters started to grow there until later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current vedars in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to the CHMÚ, and on Sundays even more significant rains could come.
Most of Moravia's locations will remain high temperatures on Friday and on the southeast of Moravia and Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Peking is losing billions for visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to apply its influence without using force resources.
It spends $10 billion annually in support of language schools and universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry to foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
That's not a good thing for Peking.
The state media there speaks of the plan to make turism the power of economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists in China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
It is caused by, among other things, that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome a foreigner with open arms, he evaluates the situation in the world's most human country, Professor of Economics from the University of Beijing Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa free contacts with China, and the citizens of the others have to deal with the visa beforehand.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese new year.
The visa costs 140 dollars, but if you don't want to wait for him for hours in line, you'll have to pay 100 dollars and more for extra services.
Such restrictions are building significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for visas reduces the country’s number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited the mainland China, while Hong Kong, who participated in a gross domestic product of China less than three percent and lives less than one percent of all the inhabitants, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in spring reduced transport to South Korea in the context of a breakdown around the South Korean anti-racrat system, the South Koreans repaid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent annually, while Japan had a 85 percent increase.
This all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to the recently published report, the Fed Central Bank could have left China as a result of the Chinese's foreign routes up to 190 billion dollars, while China, as part of selling currency to tourists, gets about 35 billion dollars a year.
According to official figures on the development of the payment balance, China had a deficit of $217 billion last year in turis, which is equal to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in the commodity trade.
A small number of tourists, therefore, a country that anxiously prevents the outflow of capital, puts a very painful wound.
However, the quantitative factors above are only one more general convergence to foreigners.
In many places, China almost never heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
There are more in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not a cross-border, has doubles.
However, a number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can't practically find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step offered is to simplify the visa aparate.
Other Asian states, especially India and Vietnam, have recently developed a great effort to simplify and leviate visa granting procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, they multiplied the deadly poisonous plagues.
Plzen Kingdom may enjoy the youngness of three rare, mortally poisonous plagues.
Only nine freshly born people will see Turkish in the exhibition so far.
This species lives in North Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"The meter lengths are up," described the spokesman zoo Martin Vobruba.
The youngest of the other two species, the mortals and the red cobras, so far they will gain power in the breeding background of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We'd hate to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal with the fact that it could take a year or two.
The Australian perverts have come to the world eight, they are descendants of breeding couples from Sydney's population.
"The individual visitors can see in the exposure belongs to the mortals of Pertha," Vobruba said that it is necessary to winter for the mortals at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsia.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a dream of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo were licked out of four eggs of a total of four young men.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," said Vobruba.
This kind of nature on his victim blows out poison, within a distance of up to four meters.
He's headed for his eyes, he can cause his blindness to last.
Youths of all three species live in the zoo with hoats.
In 40 days in the garden, youth kissing is expected from the black mamma's dreams, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to the untrue transcript of the phone interview, Trump's making pressure on Mexico because of payment for the border wall
The American Journal of Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview of 27 January with the Mexican President Enrique Peñou Nietem, Trump asked him to stop publicly spelling that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president blamed him that he publicly condemns the construction of a wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
Trump promised in his campaign that he would build a wall along the southern borders and preach that he would pay Mexico for it.
The public also escaped his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. supervisory agreement on refugees headed to Australia is "smell" and " stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to this agreement - which came to President Obama's government - he would look like a "droged" after he suggested a ban on the entry of refugees to the US.
Trump ended the call after Turnbull explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk spoke again at the D.A. for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," said the brother of the dead president, the chairman of the Government Party of Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," said Tusk and read to the current country leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
When leaving the prosecutor's office, he was waiting for Tuska according to TVN 24 crowd, which scanned Donald Tusk! and wished politician for 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and made sure he had a clear conscience, "I have nothing to worry about, and Kaczyński won't frighten me."
The prosecutors say nothing, but he does not doubt that justice is now to serve Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's been interviewed for the second time.
Experiment was questioned at the prosecutor for the second time, this time the interrogation was supposed to be questioning about the autopsy of the victims of the muddy disaster.
In addition, the body in coffins came into a change.
The families were forbidden to open the coffins, and there had to be reasons for it.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because he'd have had Polish-Russian relationships.
"The maintenance of good relationships at all costs, despite such terrible events, was intended to serve Donald Tusk to become someone very important in the EU," said Kaczyński in Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that the possible conflict with Russia would spoil Tusk’s chances of obtaining the most important chair in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński declared that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that with Donald Tusk it could happen differently, but she didn't notice.
Tusk has undergone an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office since April 19th.
He didn't even say as a suspect at the time, but as a witness.
However, many of his call for interrogation considered a part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and chief of the PiS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by connecting to various scandals.
The Prosecutor is under the responsibility of the Minister of Justice in Poland, who is responsible for the role of the Attorney General.
The call for interrogation came after the election of Tusk to the head of the European Council, which Kaczyński was struggling but striving to stop, including visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU Summit against the extension of Tuscan mandate, only the Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, he left Warsaw on the barbers and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote newly on the composition of the House of Barma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representatives since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It will flow from a decree that regulates the delivery of votes to foreign.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, at the moment is in a reminder procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for Members abroad.
"From the last amendment of the 2013 Decree, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative authorities have been established, some authorities have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," writes in material.
The decree shall contain two Annexes, of which are listed in the first paragraph by the representative offices for which paper voting tickets are added.
This group of authorities is represented by the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a vote in the printing version.
Their list is just changing with a decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could have voted on Czech ambassadors in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassys are closed.
The Czech Republic also canceled its representation in the Malaysian Bamaku and the Japanese Kyoto.
He's not even gonna vote for the General Consulate in Doněck.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 for the war in the east of Ukraine.
Newly they are on the list of embassies in Kenya Nairobi, the Senegal capital of Dakar and Zambia Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation of the General Consulate in Iraq and Čcheng-t, the capital of the Chinese province of S'čuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs had the opportunity to choose members in the election rooms at the representative offices or consulates so far four times.
Before each election of the State election committee, the loser shall determine the country for which candidates are voted abroad.
For the first time, it was in 2002 when the decision was made between South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among Southeast candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected this year.
The number of Czechs voted abroad is constantly increasing.
During the Prime Minister 15 years ago, it came to vote about 3800 people, and in 2006 there were around 6700, four years later 8222.
The premature elections of the House four years ago arrived at the embassy of 10.571 voters.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
Ford Mercury, 1948, drove around the perimeters of Monroe, Georgie and codercal towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver was enough to reach the bridge, the road was replaced by a group of white men with guns.
The leader of the group - the man of the middle age in the stripped suit - long stretched out of the cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside, the passengers shattered with fear.
"We want that n-and Roger!" screamed a man.
"Give it to me!"
Quiet breaks the scream of a young black man, which is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction event that took place on 22 July.
But when one of the men flies through the "Roger" neck, the audience will breathe by excitement.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford Bridge returned to a regular group of activists who reconstructed the destiny night of 1946, when there were two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcomová and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of Kukluxklan.
No one's been tried for murder.
"It is strange that in all these years, the only person has not been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, helping to organize the events.
"It's a spot on our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, it represents the reconstruction of the event a dramatic challenge to take place, and every year, Monroe's community reminds me that justice has not been done enough.
"We require the prosecution and the closure of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," said Brooks.
“The recovery and reconciliation process cannot be started until then.”
On July 27, 1946, the medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the lynching victim at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI reports that NBC News received, lynching was expected to attend up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Although suspects remain free for tens of years, citizens of civil rights claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, the residents of the state of Georgia’s black plea received the right to participate in the elections planned for the summer.
And right in the summer election period, according to the FBI, the farmers of black skin Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owners of Barnett Hester's white grounds during the fight because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, he used to be around Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different condition.
According to the statement, the FBI made on July 25, 1946, the leading landowner of Loy Harrison's white skin for Malcoma bail of $600.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
In returning from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects replaced their way.
"As it turns out, he planned murders and organized Harrison," said the FBI.
“It is also obvious that a secret agreement was made between the state and local law guards, who were not only involved in lynching, but also disposed of evidence and seized the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks expressed himself more briefly on the whole issue.
"It was a massacre because of the law of the election," said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local residents of black skin: "This is how you're going to get in if you register and go vote."
Every year, Cassandra Greene organizes an event reconstruction at Moore's Ford Bridge for almost ten years.
Its performance is figurative, cuffy and illustrious, showing deeply rooted racism, which many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and it is even harder to turn away from sight, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because in this case we must face unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
“But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you listen to what I had to go through.”
The main tests this year's reconstruction began in June and the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks - recorded in the room where Greene met them with a very carefully scheduled presentation.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of the auxiliary director.
For many years, he played the leader of Kukluxclan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it opposes who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, are trained by Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a fight - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my property n-e!"
There's no Rascona.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every actor of black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" Rascona's turning around.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," the Greene vests.
"Only, I don't think the white people then called "n-r' such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the actors of black skins will win out.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
Energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of convergence.
Everyone wants to be authentic, just to be done behind enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona puts emphasis on the right expression of the word on the N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The show ends violently and fast.
The bushes, the shots... and the silence has come.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings a grieving song by Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen watching people wipe their sweat and tears out of their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the community.
One couple traveled from New York City, many observers from nearby surroundings.
Each of them bears a local moisture climate almost eight hours, and Brooks is in the crowd leading to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until this moment, it could have been seen at murders with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where lynching occurred, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words, Greene's crowd will be invited to inspect the bodies.
Kids are kneeling to the heads of the victims, watching fake blood, and unhybted bodies, and whispering something in their ears.
"They're not dead," a little boy will grind.
It'll take a few minutes and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and stop tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona, let's hug our two friends-herces and cry in their arms; eventually there are emotions on him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know that the role is adhering to you.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feeling of today's performance.
"It's hard to listen to the ugly words and look at the disgusting deeds... that people look like you do, and they do it because they look like you," she said to reconstruction.
“It will make me realize that lynching is still the current topic,” said, “he is called police fights.”
On the other hand, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom and enjoys dinner and talks about civil rights.
His own words have already begun to plan the show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to experience – but it is also a moment to think,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says the instructions for using only a coward.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often rival surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember the past times, where the instructions to use anything was rather a rarit defect.
So, for example, my first recorder contained only one paper on which the hieroglyphs were showing the involvement of some components, there were all secret marks.
After years of misunderstanding, I offered that list to the chaseman who wasn't afraid to scramble the back board.
He told me what the paper with the line labyrinth was suitable for.
Yes, it was a used help with the chronic deterioration of toilet paper.
The game found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl pies again.
The new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he just held a cross-sectioned grapefruit, required about ten images.
Particularly, a sketch with a description of how to move one piece into another.
The set was two-party, and the other procedure just wasn't possible.
Oppositely, it required considerable efforts with the necessity of breaking certain plastic components.
My contempt of the instructions ended with my Seat Leon's self-hyb.
The year of production 2003 had such a book with the instructions of minor corrections, including the exchange of the blinker lamp.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions forgot to state that while the bulb right went to turn really in three steps.
One separate cover.
2. scratch the cracked light bulb and screw the new one.
3. put the cover on.
The left bulb had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by pushing the right upper limb into the wagon, I'd find a spring, a screw that was easily removed and then I'd already follow points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
Law mistake.
The cover had no place, no space for a slim arm of Popelka, let alone the Obese Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by the entrance of my wife to the garage, which the rhythms and words that my mouth hears completely exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked me with nothing.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I missed the vulgar terms, there were only two public words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"Why does it take you so long?" risked a sentence that could be her last in the long term.
I slowly explained the problem, with the main emphasis on the procedure of torture by the author of the instructions, where blessed by the burnt iron on the hand that the instructions wrote, then by her comfort, so that he could never write anything again, was just a introduction into a wide range of instructions of Kladida on the witch, including his comic burning on the top of the Losin castle.
"How about to disassemble the box?" said the woman was wearing the battery.
It happened in clear despair and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day my colleague called me, who was just discussing the collapse state after checking the two officials of the State Department for Medicinal Control.
I know him as a competing colleague who experienced the possible and impossible in the field, and who can also interpret wild stories with an undisciplined voice.
"Put that I was penanced for not being given the instructions on washing my hand," he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I had the whole problem that he had in mind that over the sink in the patient's toilet there was no picture instructions to wash his hands.
His argumentation by the Commission's official that adults usually can wash their hands and that there is no need for icon to handle the ordinary activity of decent people, had no healing effect and cost it little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of washed hands of running water is a primitive act at the level of the kromanian that a modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, is doing this ceremony in ten steps.
Then it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the couch.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end, it is a joyful finding that a man washed his hands exactly as it ordered him a hosudar from the SÚKL.
In the end, I must point out that I have been inspired and prepared a detailed plan to operate in the toilet.
In the matter of defection there is a single procedure, there is no problem, for urination, given a certain differentiation of both sexes, it will need to hang out instructions two.
The problem remains the icons, as the creation of a perfect procedure means even the exact drawing of all anatomy details, which could wake up at a prudent visitor of the toilet certain abduction, given that he could finally learn that he had wiped out the right hole in a completely wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson releases another 3000 employees and reduces dividends in trying to revive trade
The British Education Group Pearson stated on Friday that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring programme to change the business model.
Another wave of discharge, which, according to the statement of Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision to release 4000 employees in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of £300 million (394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to increase the declining trade due to a sharp development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its share in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said that the view of this year remained unchanged after it declared a one-procent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack, and several others were injured, said official representatives.
Five soldiers and interpreter were wounded, and NATO is expressed.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died during the attack in Qarabagh County.
This month, Afghanistan hit a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday during the explosion in the heratian mosque.
On Monday, the suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that the Tuesday explosion occurred after the patrol with the members of the Afghan Army was attacked by a “local person with an explosive device”.
The statement further states that all injuries of soldiers are out of danger of life and are located in the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of NATO’s allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people killed the bomb in the car in the Kabul district of Shia.
Taliban has signed up for the attack.
On 31 May, he killed a large explosion in the city center of more than 150 people. This is the most fatal militant attack in the country since the U.S. forces have dropped the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is already undermining a doubtful situation in Afghanistan, and President of the United States Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military forces and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have been shattered to which the public trust in the government in recent weeks, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Ašraf Ghanín.
In response to the action, the EPA re-assessed its decision to dissuade the rules of smoking
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the Law of Obama's administration, which has ordered States to reduce emissions only a day after the Agency has sued 15 states.
The EPA has notified its decision on the delegation of "Ozone Standards 2015" in Wednesday nights, with the word that it submits an agency's commitment to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said CEO Scott Pruitt.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA’s efforts to delay the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, on the basis of measurement, determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., brought an action on Tuesday, justifying that the EPA negotiations were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid many environmental regulations suggested by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in trying to kick economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have initiated countermeasures by the Democrats and conservative groups that are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that air breathing with ozone content “can reduce the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as as as as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flows!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer has arranged for the Czech stands of a monstrous event that hosted such a leading personality as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and a number of others, and the event has not been modernized by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, show up to the public, and introduce your music video to Sara's song, whose baptism has just been made by the appointed personalities.
A few who already know that the video climp itself was filmed in Russia did not run without any problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big movie with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't go without a real embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a blow of facks in the video clip.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and in the nose that a young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, the blood started out of my nose immediately," commented on the situation of Ladislav.
The colleagues and producers said the situation at the place was unfortunate and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injuries weren't so serious to influence the continued shooting.
We now bring you a video clip of a young artist, you can also record the scene with a punch in it.
The unscrupulous version with blood, but it was not preferable to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could inspire the most exciting boxing game in a light vase, met at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was found in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the unprofessional champion in the light weight World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed the Lomačenka, the champion in the serial weight of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-fold world champion Adrien Broner in the Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got to the list of five best fighters in light vase.
Garcia drew his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomačenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomačenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former champion in a featherweight," Garcia adds.
“For the fight with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain, but I'm not that big.
My 63 pounds are small.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
The Slayer has to pull back to get lightly... then we can get away.
The fans want it.
Why don't you fill it with them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"The box would be good for this game."
Klimas claimed a payment for an overview - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should graduate his debut in a light vase at the end of this year and next year, Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the fight against Jorge Linares duel winners vs. Luke Campbell, who are arrested on 23 September for a degree in light vase in the arena Forum.
“The wrestling should take place by means of a payout style, so they ask fans,” Garcia said, who later expressed that it was open to broadcast the match through the television station, which comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that attention to each other.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he acknowledged Lomačenka as a “great boxer” and could participate in his Saturday fight.
But the Lomachenko didn't make Garcia cheerleading when he said that the champion of three divisions from Riverside looked "sorry slowly... sorry, Mike, but you're thinking of knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said that they felt the tension before each other's duel.
“You can't just forget this game.
No other fight will take so much attention.
And I will, with great pleasure, put in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomačenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A couple of 12 years ago, he disappeared without a trace.
Their car was found on the bottom of the Volha.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There's been a massive search for them, but no success.
And eventually, the police stopped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to a couple.
After 12 years, a sad ending of the whole story came.
The wreck of their car found a cheap diver at the bottom of the Volha River in the town of Čeboksara in Čuvašsk.
Only thanks to the documents that were left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire decade underwater, without them the police would take much longer to identify the identified.
The last couple were seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick his girlfriend out of work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous so far.
He reported his discovery to the Czech police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen path leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after the end of the investigation.
Recent results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people have been asked as 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÓttsmedicinalverket) began to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess more precisely the applicants in assessing asylum applications. The measure was added after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) has been criticised for failure in determining the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
The Swedish Migratory Agency has now forwarded a total of 2481 tests made from mid-March to 31 July 2017 for investigation of 6880 cases by the Forensic Medical Agency.
80 percent (2002) were judged as 18 years old, while in the next 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the question was “possible to 18 years of age”.
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the question was ‘may be under 18 years’.
Tests shall only be applied if the age of the questioned is disputed.
According to Johan Gíransson, the results of the Forensic Medical Agency correspond to the previous month.
"Across the last month, statistics are kept in high tracks and numbers are very similar," said The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated at age 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years or older”.
The news of Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the questioned said he would have had 18 years this year.
The criteria were also awaited by a medical method of determining the age, which included the X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and MRI of the knee joint scan, which subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Carolin Institute, which, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological dosage of people to determine the age of puberty concerned.
“I had a reason to think about this issue, and I do not think these types of measurements to assess the age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is in a certain sense very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise," said Metro for the newspaper.
The Agency's Góransson Medical Agency defended the decision: “The risk of misunderstanding of a child as a adult is currently small.
The highest risk represents the fact that the person in question is closely below the 18-year limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all the questions."
Trump threatened President Mexico on the phone.
The American President Donald Trump in the January call to the Mexican President Enrique Peň Niet threatened that he would not meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of the wall between the USA and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Likewise, he spoke to Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It's coming from the transcripts of interviews published by the American Journal of The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of the wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's preelection campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after entering Trump Penieu Nieta's function, undiplomatically coughed for being critical to his plan on the construction of the wall.
The South Neighbour ruled as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in a conversation of January 27, and threatened to discontinue contact with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a resentment statement.
I hear funding is going to work out, and it's gonna end up good.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you guys anymore because that's unacceptable for me," said the American Trump journal.
The wall, however, referred to as the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it may be the most important thing.
The expedient command to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after taking over power.
The Mexican construction and financing of walls of 3200 kilometres has declined, and the relations of both countries have thus become irrelevant.
At the end of March Trump said that the project will be valid for the United States.
In the end, Trump met with his Mexican counter for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed about Trump's phone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull from January 28th.
Chief of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
In such a conclusion, an exchange of views on an agreement that Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for taking the United States from accession facilities in the Pacific Islands.
The Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later he joined her.
"You can certainly say that this is not a deal you made, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull said.
In some passages, the phone interview with Turnbull was almost feasible, for example when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump was joking.
Suddenly, the tone of the interview has elevated.
"I hate to accept these people," said Trump.
I assure you they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people who will work for local milkers," he said.
In the interview he also pointed out that the refugee could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, i.e. about a week after the arrival of the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world state states, often several during one day.
The call with Turnbull finally referred to as the least pleasant in the whole day.
Before he finished him, he said he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
Before the crowd, they killed Rana's killer.
Even her father was watching.
The execution took place in the square in the capital of Jemenu Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his victim the little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took her father's house where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which then threw close to the mosque.
A violent death of a little girl hit a whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of the thousand-headed crowd to be witnessed by the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was condemned under the law of the chariot.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Even the other members of the family were present, together with the crowd yelled the password "to live justice."
The rapist in the square brought the police van from which he was brought out.
The cops tied him to the belly.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every wound that was burned out.
Mr Al Almatari said to MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the country's legal system.
"The justice, Alah and the law of the chariot won," he added.
I stood at the Sana Hall of Liberation and was waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then the family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been accomplished.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, the killer would catch up and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court under the control of the Shiite Huts.
But after arrest, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whip wounds, but his act woke up such a disgrace that the judge decided to punish death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched his house's basement, she discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would have been more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that brought Rana's body was terrible," he said to the media.
"The morning disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
A girl's mother, Jamileh, must have been hospitalized after she found out her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to go out playing with other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he is.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking in vain.
The residents of Yemen were devastated by crime and began to gather before the police station, where al Maghrabi was held, and to demand immediate punishment.
The deputy of the Ministry of Justice has read the records of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused, according to all his actions, did not show regret.
Just before the punishment, the police read his sentence, but the sentenced man only looked at his executioner this summer.
The whole event was recorded for national television, but there were many records on the internet that the crowd had arranged.
Governor West Virginia announced a change of political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday night at President Trump's meeting that he's going to another side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today after a long prayer and reflection, I am telling you... today as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The retreat of the observers exploded in joy.
"I'll report to the Republicans tomorrow," said Justice.
"As a coach I can tell you, it's time to jump into another game."
Trump promised the people at the meetings in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia 42 points and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to the Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited great property from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night, in which it stood: “The Governor of Justice is another morning for the democratic party, which puts obstacles in our way, instead of giving rise to our country up.”
“For the democratic party, which has only 15 governors and has the least legal authorities in history, the announcement of the Governor of Justice is the last drop for the already so diminished party without a leader who is striving to find a positive and unified report,” said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in her statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's “true” apology for the doping scandal
The former excellent athlete Sebastian Coe commended on Thursday Russia for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that there was no time to return Russia to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athletic Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was held in the evening of the MS in the athletic - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said, “all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite its comments, IAAF members voted in favour of maintaining the ban which entered into force in November 2015 after the World Antidoping Agency report (WADA) showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think that today we have witnessed very sincere answers and presentations," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised to admit their mistake and work with all the power to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said that he was also “happy” that Russia adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have stepped up to another stage, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis staff on the preservation of the punishment that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“In the coming months, we have to do everything to stabilize the situation.
Our efforts were always to separate honest athletes from those unfair," he ended his speech.
Athletic MS, which begins on Friday in London, will be under the neutral flag to compete with 19 Russian athletes who have complied with strict IAAF rules.
The chief of the IAAF Rune Andersen Crisis staff said that Russia still has to fulfil several criteria before it is admitted back.
Tests for drug presence are still inappropriate and the exclusion of coach continues to operate, told the reporters in London after the IAAF Council's presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract has acquired Františka Savova, whose state is prosecuting.
The CzechTrade State Pro-export Agency's public contract has won the publishing of the Young Front Františka Savova.
The officials have given him a hundred percent of points in all qualitative criteria.
They didn't mind that the Czech State was chasing Savov for tax fraud and demanding his release to Czech Republic.
CzechTrade's pro-export agency issued a public contract in April for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract of the total value of the CZK 30.8 million was won by the publisher Young line of entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police already accused of tax evasions in 2014 and pursued him on the run.
Savov fled to the Great Britain and Czech Republic asks for his release.
In case, he alerted the server Aktually.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was supposed to decide 60 percent of the offered price and from the remaining 40 competitions for beauty, i.e. the quality of the project.
As a result, Savov’s company has helped the second criterion.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received 100 points in all sub-priority criteria.
It was the result that moved her before the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM publisher, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of 404 900 crowns a month, the VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it has received a sub-priority assessment from judges in all qualitative criteria, total of 62 points.
The tendru also participated in the consultant BDO Advisory and digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Actually.cz under Economia publishing.
VLM issuer has made several objections against the result of the tender, with its assessment considered to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it decided to attack a competition at the Authority for the Protection of Competition of the EPA.
He believes that CzechTrade was opposed to the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has made a decision to select the contract supplier on the basis of a rigorous subjective assessment, clearly favouring the member of the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," writes in the proposal to open the procedure submitted at the IUHS this week, which published the server currently.
According to the Director-General and the Chairman of VLM Michal Klímy, the pointing of the selection committee seems to be an incredibly and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as exceptionally suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspected," said Klíma.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed itself as a result of the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not substantially comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information on you mentioned contracts are in accordance with the law published in the contracting authority's Profile and in the Public Contracting Office.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express itself," said the media representative of the Agency Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by a statement that it considers to be extremely problematic that Economia's publishing has hit an article in Actually.cz in the competition where he has its own business interests.
However, such a fact was set out in that Article.
In the tendrum, it could have helped her to provide BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
For the first time, the contract was contested in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Kuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the tax evasion police in connection with excessive VAT deduction to its companies, which caused the Czech State to damage up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has requested the Great Britain to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, his criminalization chief of the movement, yes, Andrei Babiš, whose influence falls under Mafra publishing.
The London Court of First Instance rejected Savovo's appeal last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, from Great Britain, we have not yet received any understanding in the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment," said Actually.cz spokesman of the Prague City Prosecutor Štěpánka Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was located in Harvestor Limited with its registered office in Cyprus, which was controlled by the Czech-Buievic brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, which was purchased at risk of assets.
Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, who owe over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also linked to bringing the property out of the former socialist youth union.
The biker ran down the sidewalks and the park, ended up in anchorages.
The biker put attention on himself on the streets, sidewalks and park travelers in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of Stan.
"Police men with increased caution chased the city when he couldn't drive on one of the side roads on Mariánských Lázně, and with a motorcycle went into the field where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Eventually, the rescue helicopter had to fly to the Pilsen hospital to the injured biker.
Afterwards, the police found that the motorcycle's own driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were removed, its production number was cut off and the production label itself removed.
It's possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to another investigation.
"The test carried out was suspended at the site of alcohol in the driver, but the test was found positive on the substance metamfetamine," said the police spokesman.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymara to Paris
The rules limiting the financing of European football clubs do not interfere with Neymar's record passage from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which supervises European soccer teams and has the power to prohibit team participation in the prestigious Liza Masters.
The financial fair play rules (FFP) which introduced the EUFA in 2011 provide that PSG will have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million to purchase Neymara from its contract and Neymar will require a salary of several million dollars per year.
Several financial conditions are followed by Neymar's transgression to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a rich cataracic family, which has rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymara into such a star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts for buying players, but on the other hand they have to demonstrate legal income sources, allowing them to cover the administrative costs of football business activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after joining the chair of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that owe themselves to new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovič used with Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and spent horent sums for players y to build a global brand - suddenly he was not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may declare losses to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the prohibition of excessive spending.
"The FFP rules are still valid and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," said last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, which is supervising compliance with the FFP rules.
Although PSG paid the amount for redemption of Neymara in a disposable payment, it may, for the purposes of accounting, distribute the amount to the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be written to EUR 44.4 million each year for a period of five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions of the FFP hit PSG in 2014 together with Manchester City, who owns the Abu Dhabi group.
The PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million (82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the male League of Masters to 21 players in the season 2014-2015, instead of 25 players.
EUFA is paying attention to teams that may attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing its revenue through companies associated with club owners.
Therefore, although the Catar company sponsors PSG as soon as financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, EUFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
The EUFA adopted a similar measure in 2014 following its decision that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of the Neymar income in the PSG could be paid from the organising committee of MS in football 2022 in Qatar according to some reports.
However, the PSG and the representatives of the MS 2022 in Qatar denied fat that Neymat should become the ambassador of the MS in football and that EUFY players would easily reveal such a maneuver.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that the EUFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent rules,
According to Tuesday, the dedicated EUFA did not initiate any investigation in the case of the transfer of Neymara to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous as it is not entitled to comment on the situation with the PSG, said The Associated Press.
The last published accounts show that the PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and EUR 542.4 million turnover.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signature of the contract.
The Spanish league leaders, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, tried to destroy Neymar's departure, claiming that the PSG would break the FFP rules.
“It is a clear case of the “financial dopingu” of the club and the state,” said the president la Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the ownership of the PSG cataracic syndicate.
The manager of Arsenal Arsenal Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's position on the financing of the club.
“It is a result of ownership that has changed the football world from the foundations in the last 15 years,” said Wenger on Thursday.
“ As soon as the owner of the club becomes, everything is possible.
Compliance with the financial fair play rules is very difficult because the State may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartian Bookmarker Rosický: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický goes to the square.
The same scene as on Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Sparťan Bookmarker was moving against the Crved Elevator game, he invented several goals, but his teammates didn't head to the black one.
The airline team, pumped by new multimillion reinforcements, thus ending after the introductory double match in European cups.
Was there anything else hard to do with the match after the Belgrade Brother?
After the incredibly score, four had to be shot, which was hard for us.
At least we tried not to lose, to raise our confidence, so that we should get away with what to fight other games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the fight for so long?
The game is so worked.
The combinations of the opponent were much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, and in the middle of a time, we fired one.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half of time was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push the opponent more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the assembly?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new man is formed.
We've only played three competition games, and the assembly is still changing.
The point is that coach finds the perfect eleven that sits down.
Is it encouragement for you to have already played part of two matches after each other?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will evolve, and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's just like the wound.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came in great numbers again, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Show me something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visiting like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season be at least a advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting each other, we're playing, so that's not the advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the businessman has to sit down for ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint by a Jiří Toman entrepreneur who is supposed to be taking taxes to a significant extent to offset ten years in prison.
The amount of damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice violated its fundamental rights, the factual findings of courts in Zlín and Olomouc are incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges claimed an unfounded complaint, the ČTK found out of the court database.
The US is not another appealing court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, judge factual or legal doubts which the general courts allegedly committed if they do not constitute infringements of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," stands in the resolution.
Toman was tried to escape.
The verdict has been competent since November 2015 when the Chief Court of First Instance has confirmed it in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in an issuer's custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, it was also at the time of the decision-making of the SA.
The penalty imposed is at the top of the legal rate, which corresponds to the damage suffered according to the verdict.
The main court has identified the case as a extreme tax leakage which has even a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He worked as chairman of the World Service Board between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was incurred only for the period from January to July 2008, the overall leakage according to the expert exceeded a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the whole amount.
According to the defendant, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax credits.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise taxation in the orders of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only statistics.
World Service and some companies with which the company has traded have a relationship with the Radomír Entrepreneurs, who have chosen justice for VAT machining in fuel stores for 13 years in prison.
He also rejected his complaint before the Constitutional Court.
Serials “Late to Survival” and “Comrade Detective” play the nostalgic string
Iteration of the story is nostalgic for figures from the famous '80s; and for the dirty 90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put on the MTV comedy sketch 'The State'); and of course for modern times, namely, 2001, than the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Peaser and Paul Ruddd have spread to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parodie and also the embodiment of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
From the franchise point of view, it looks like someone's running out of breath.
The “First Day of Camp” series worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to the absurd humor (for example, the story of the formation of talking cans with the vegetables that H. Jon Benjamin urged).
Authors have turned out to be the main funny point - actors of the middle age who play teenage horny children - and they could not be pulling out of previous events.
Continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play so much on emotional plane and satira is posts to sporadic, including parodies on thrillers from the 1990s as "Ruka on the Cole."
At one point, the figure will be found on the Apple Powerbook Harbor, roller skates and “a lot of other things from 1991.”
Many major stories are repeated.
The goodhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the writer, has still not passed over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy engagement that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which encourages George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, they are the best part of the franchise of many side stories.
Particularly fun is watching the young Rudd with long hair, alias Matt Dillon's figure of the Young movie, whose once respectable figure of Andy is now behind the old paprika.
The French could start the moments of accidental madness, such as the "Seven Up" series again until it reaches what I assume is logical: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the entire group will be released to the premiere "Late to Survival".
"Comrade Detective" in Amazon in the meantime appeals to another type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the cold war of the series "Such normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No regret" and even the series "GLOW" in which the icons of the east and west wrestling scene are gathered.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak in Rhys Thomas' residency are supposed to act as a television inscension: a drama of two bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxismu-leninism.
The main roles - the toughening Gregor and the idealist Iosef - play Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulici, which have taken over to the English language of Channing Tatum (perfect producer of the show) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
For some jokes you laugh (such as police officers watching chess on TV - parodie on American football).
The series borrowed its voice by many famous actors - between them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" is, however, too focused on a vicious propaganda drama - which includes a killer with a mass of Reagan - and it also looks like.
Six long episodes are too delicate, and comedyal moments aren't enough.
In shorter traces, propagandistic satira in the “Comrade Detective” could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in which two fattenings have hamburgers put on a large pile.
A clear message for an imaginary communist community is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The ideas of Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
The Russian athletes have failed to cancel the IAAF start ban.
The International IAAF Association at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian racers due to the state supported by the doping programme.
The vote in the world championship scene, which starts on Friday, came very clearly according to the expectations.
In order to extend the ban, 166 delegates were pronounced, only 21 votes were against.
The main reason for rejection is the fact that Russia cannot meet all the antidoping system requirements, as the chief of the IAAF Rune Andersen Special Investigation Group stated before the Congress.
His group recommended that the prohibition continues.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard, and there are still coaches working in the country with a corrupt reputation.
The Russian antidoping agency RUSADA is not fully functional yet, which does not meet the standards of the World Antidoping Agency.
However, under the supervision of foreign experts and the British antidoping agencies can perform testing.
"In spite of progress, we still need to do a lot of work," said the chairman IAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so the Russian athletes lost last year's Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians will take part, who have already demonstrated that they have been tested out of the Russian antidoping system for a long time.
But they won't be able to start in national colors and in case of victory they won't play a Russian hymn.
The Bank of England will hold a interest rate at 0,25 %
The Bank of England should, according to the expectations, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following an irrelevant economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has resulted in speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “in the background” in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite the overwhelming of family budgets.
The Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) Banks of England voted six to two for the preservation of interest rates at 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of an increase in interest rate supported the impartial economic growth supported by a weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank foretold growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the Bank suggested that in the next few years, there should be growth due to the inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that rents from vulnerability should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of part of the mammut's package, whose task was to support the economy, which was introduced in practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the plan of the timetable should start paying from next February, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England stated that, compared with the planned £15 billion, it will now offer £15 billion less.
In short before the decision, the Bank stated: “MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will shortly stagnate with the pressure on real household income and consumption burden”.
On tariffs, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to ‘leash cash policy’ to calm inflation, “up to a higher degree” than the markets expect.
Markets are now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be ‘free’ and ‘restricted’.
The Bank reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% foreseen in May.
The expected growth in 2018 was unchanged at 1.8 %.
After the publication of the estimates, the dollar and the euro decreased.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollar and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a disappointing increase buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped to 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase, with great probability, will remain to 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it should be slightly increased according to the Bank's comments.
The latest report on inflation is a slight comfort for households affected by increasing inflation and miserable increases in salaries.
The report further states that the monetary policy cannot prevent the reduction of revenue in the coming years, but the wages are expected to rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase thanks to the great interest in British goods thanks to weak libra, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This Decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0,025% last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a decrease in libra.
The Bank estimates that the total uniting of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the decision of the bank on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with increasing inflation, which increased the pressure on households. Three political players demanded a increase in June to 0.5%.
The inflation last month decreased to 2.6% from June to 2.9%, even though the bank stated that this change was expected and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank argued that the overlapping of the relative to 2% of the target was ‘call’ as a result of weak libry.
Andrew Montlake, Director Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise as soon as the creditors begin to compete on contracts with a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and recapitalisation - there are options without fees, as well as low rates that they gain in popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug 10,000 patients
Patients have since September access to “transformative” treatment for HIV prevention based on the decision of the highest court on NHS funding.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis pill (PrEP) that is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 percent will be offered through medical service to approximately 10,000 patients under the three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year with a statement that the NHS has funds to pay PrEP despite the statement that the medicine should finance local authorities.
The decision notified on Thursday was adopted by the NHS England from the mouth of the Director-General Simon Stevens as a “great intervention” while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decision moment”.
The clinics of sexual health in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start taking patients. Other clinics will join in October and until April 2018 will complete implementation across the whole of England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV medicine that is given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among endangered patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is sufficient amount of specific medicines in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinicals shall determine eligible participants who sign consent to participation in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in Great Britain can also sign up in their local clinic of sexual health and seek potential participation in testing.
The programme comes taxpayers for £10 million and the NHS England signed this week a drug distribution contract after obtaining an international public contract.
The test period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PrEP, its aim, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should be complemented and fully burdened with continuous expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
He's another milestone in over 30 years trying to stop one of the biggest challenges of human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnesses of a decisive moment in combating HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and to patients at risk, it will offer a possibility to change the English epidemic of HIV.
Since September, NSH will offer patients who are exposed to a high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and does not require a partner to intervene, resulting in improving the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust said: “The first priority must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
Now we have a PrEP test medicine and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
Sharon Hodgson's Shadow Secretary of Health said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial is welcome and a long-term change after months of delay and retention from the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the termination of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect people who are exposed to HIV together, thus stop the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on the high leg: the interstellar and smart design transformed this small apartment to Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, former banker with passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - and is an appreciative demonstration of modern design that uses to the maximum space available.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in the Knightsbridge district," said Joanne.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him right now, and the same day I screamed at him."
Since then, the apartment has passed by the size of 1,000 square meters of complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to pass the kitchen - wanted Joanne to add deck spaces and a half-floor to use a high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the designer and design studio Duck & Shed with its headquarters in Notting Hill and used a almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights as two gaps - the challenge for architects so it was to create an interdependence on which to walk upright.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
‘The steel construction is completely complicated,’ he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk straight.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time to fire the steel structure so that at the right height above and under the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on itself - and at the same time add to drama.
In the outskirts he sees the beautiful living room of old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in golden color, silver line and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
Use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storage of fittings and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the whole apartment a considerably larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if not used.
The cuisine is nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is a stabbing door.
"We had to solve the technical page," says Erfan about reinforced doors.
“The doors are provided with anti-treatment to make it very easy.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained a further 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall setting of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you sell is a living area, or the appreciation of your property," said Erfan.
‘The real estate broker in principle calculates its price on the basis of the residential area when entering the apartment.’
In this case, it managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that lend the space of luxury appearance.
"Material is very important because you touch him and create an emotional relationship with your home," said Erfan.
“You will not love electricity distributions in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get."
As it turned out, the quality design and increase of the living space can transform the ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And as well as Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States are disconnecting.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepened.
California has issued a ban on travelling its citizens to the State of Tennessee and the other seven states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a revenge ban on traveling his citizens to California.
Obviously, this is not a ban in full sense, the US citizens may travel freely in all 50 states.
This is the fact that California has prohibited to spend State money on the paths of its citizens to eight other countries Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle considers it discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted a law on the reservation of conscience, according to which the psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with the treatment of patients from the LGBT community, has no obligation to provide it, has the obligation to ensure another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again adopted laws according to which religious charity organisations, which have received children from mothers after birth to adoption, have no obligation to adopt these children to provide uniform sex couples.
Because of these laws on the exception of California’s conscience, it prohibited financing of its citizens’ travels to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, this means that California professionals must not have the way to scientific symposia, for example in Texas, paid from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Likewise, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support of their schools.
On the road, they have to get either federal grants, but it's absurd for the federal government to finance the paths of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsoring.
The Tennessee State has reached its patience and its Parliament has adopted a resolution that he also does not like the California policy of high taxes, high state expenses, high deficits and tolerances of illegal immigrants, but it does not impose on California because of this travel embargo.
He's charging them as retaliation for California's travel embargo to Tennessee.
And it will be the same to any state of the Union that would have ordered a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he invited the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is contradictory.
The states have the right to adopt laws on the subject of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they can't do.
Secondly, what's wrong with conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why make him sell porks under the sanction, when the butchers offering pork is enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces anti-discriminatory lawsuits and high fines because he refused to bake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him in peace and order the cakes at hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federation system is that the constitutional rights of all the federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can have an internal, domestic policy in the powers which are not federal, adjust according to their own, i.e. in accordance with their preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let living, which should be guided by all reasonable people, but some activists do not seek tolerance towards themselves and others, but about extreme insolence against others.
No one must ever demonstrate moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if he does, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern enemies of freedom.
In the fifth, I don't know the situation in the American history where the states have done this for political issues, except for the one case.
Even in the time of the struggle for black people's civil rights, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and South on the side of the segregation, the States did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 50th year of the 19th century, the political case was slavery and went to the war of the North against South.
Of course, there is no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the red Republican states is deepened and the US is mentally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critique has been penalized.
The Russian opposition policy of Alexej Navalnyj received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violation of the campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court gave him a fine for provoking people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalnyy organized two major anti-governmental street protests in the last two months and announced that he wanted to go after the head of the state in March next year.
The official boss of Kreml Vladimir Putin has not yet reported his candidature, but it is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalnyi said the police came home this morning and took him to court.
He gave him the fine for calling people to demonstrations through videos placed on the YouTube web portal.
The fine is three hundred grand.
"Before, we're gonna pull them off the salary of the judge," he was joking on the twitter critique of Kremla.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalnyi cannot participate in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of disbelief.
However, Navalny, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
The fines of 300,000 rubles, as well as 25,000 rubles of the court on Thursday also imposed two members of the Naval pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj joined Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign all over the place.
In February he was sentenced to a five-year sentence due to robbing Kirovles' forest company.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so competent, which, according to Russian law, prevents the running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of an empire by their Italian family, stretch by one of the most expensive Victorian real estates worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak County, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who brought a dispute about common property and business assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly pronounced before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna owns 38 real estates worth over half a billion dollars. The first shop bought a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, Westco Jeans founded its family, which expanded into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company at $85 million.
Other properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family have been purchased for money now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, which according to Paul’s words, is “a significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns two-thirds of assets.
The Court reports that Colin owns 316 million dollars, while Paul manages real estate for $176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds has just become difficult.
“Colin’s proposal was very pronounced in my eyes,” wrote Paul in the vice-priced statement in the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few failed attempts to reconcile, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now are also fighting for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his comments, cut off Colin.
Colin opposes that it is not true and accuses Paul of wrong handling certain properties.
In the former vice-previous statement, Colin said that he believed in the apparent resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that the family is most important," wrote.
The costs of the court stand are rising. Hundreds of pages of vice-administrative statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooded by lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defenders of both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a walk in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For money gained by building property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy.”
Anna De Lutis said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would go well.
“Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was remunerated at his departure by $10 million and Luke's $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation.”
Since then, Colin has been holding back, despite the fact that he is a former member of the Management Board of the AFL Club, as he said in his autobiography from 2015, Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied through a text report in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was addressed before the court, “I have no added to it.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter in court,” wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in Colin’s court said that he tried to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
“Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,” he had heard and added to “he still hopes in a seeming solution.”
On Friday, all hopes were unaware.
"Our disputes will be resolved in the early trials," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Drivers of MHD are faking water and summer clothes.
In the maternal school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are currently going, they only go out in the morning.
The school is after the reconstruction and planted trees do not give a big shadow yet.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower in the mistress.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where the stomachs are withdrawn and the curtains are pulled.
The air is trying to cool the air, because they don't have air conditioning.
It's difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limit for maternity schools, so we should actually not have an open operation in this period," said the director of the schools Miloslav Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in the preschool, where she thinks the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We'll blow up in the morning after 6:00, close the windows, and we'll have the south sides of the stomach that we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest preschool Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees growing on the property, so we're underneath them.
"There's a beautiful nut, there's a table underneath, and there's things we do," said Barbora Kompane's nurse.
Teachers and kids try to go to the woods where they're bigger.
The children of wet hats and have different games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-pressure distillery, which is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Kompanová.
Also the director of the maternity nursery in Novoborská street at Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers are trying to keep their children in the shadows and drop them water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out this morning and then after 15:00.
Every child has to have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a few sweet tea or diluted juice and have drinks with water in the garden.
Each day they also eat vegetable salad and eat fresh fruit and vegetables that sometimes give them to their parents.
"It's like a mother brought about a 10-kyll melon here today," she added Makovičková.
Drivers receive water or summer equality.
Prague transport firm DPP provides them with hot days of water, ion drinks or summer equation.
The cabins of drivers are also buses in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokesman Aneta Řehková.
Air-conditioned in addition to the cabins, some trams and passenger space are air-conditioned.
Tramways of high temperatures have not really damaged them yet.
Small damage occurred in the loop in the Hostivara.
At current high temperatures, we especially care to make sure that drivers have enough beverages.
"The cooled drinking water is available in all loops, shift points and cars," said Řehková.
In cars and in some alternate places, the staff have so-called sodobarys that produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokesman added.
The hot and dry weather has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the entire Czech Republic destroyed 108, i.e. twice the long-term average of the day.
On Tuesday, over the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsia, he used firefighters mainly to fight fire.
"There are fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with the harvest work," said the spokesman of the firemen Nicole Zaoral.
The firemen’s relief did not bring any evening weather change where the heat in a number of places changed the storms and slopes.
With regard to the storms, firefighters went to 236 interventions.
In particular, it was about removing the trees and branches.
"Sometimes they intervened in the Middle Bohemian Region," Zaoral continues.
But the help of firemen was needed in Stvolinks in Czech Republic, where 60 people from the camp evacuated because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also contributed to the work to Prague paramedics.
On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the ambulances went out to ten cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.
People should therefore keep their water heaters checked, warn the paramedics.
Coal oxide is colourless gas without smell, which is released in imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling sick.
In case of suspected poisoning, the infected room should be left.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president's media diet
Many tried it before, and they've always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
The Politico portal said that the new Chief of Staff in the White House is planning to reduce the flow of information by President Trump - including the report in the news - in the hope of keeping Trump on the level.
Here's a part of Josh Dawsey's reporter:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met the first day in a new function with his employees, he set out the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: the wrong information that gets to the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or on the word - because the president could decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors broke their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates several decades back - and now, when he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
“If Trump was anxious as a candidate with honorary reports, it was convenient to show that he was speaking about in positive light a lot of other media that was easier to persuade,” said in February for Politico Sam Nunberg, the former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that “the key to maintain Trump's tweet in the ear - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - it is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praise upon him.”
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his opinions on Twitter was “under control”, is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more agitating if anyone hadn't checked them.
We will never know about the tweet Trump never sent.
If his employees were able to keep him at least several times in pass, then their efforts did not escape.
However, no one has been able to regularly prevent Trumps from stimulating controversial topics.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival fractions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving Trump's materials - which they can, but may not be reliable - which support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all parties, published in May a report on the tendency of consultants to submit doubtful information to the head of the State.
This is an example of such information from the Shane Goldmacher pen:
“The current and former officials of Trumpa claim that the President often responds very angry with the negative news from the media, especially on reports on the leakage of information, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the web page of the provocate Charles C. Johnson - who accused the Chief Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source of many leakages from the White House.
Notwithstanding that Johnson was forever banished from Twitter for harassment, or that he had not provided any evidence of his claim; or that he had already published false accusations in the past, and later called them off.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the Chief of Staff of Reince Priebus and the Secretary of the White House Rob Porter “we were trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump.”
Would it work?
Kelly now, three months later, tries to enforce the same strategy.
Maybe he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulse doesn't just disappear, and his helpers are still fighting for power.
These immense factors will certainly make Kelly's mission difficult.
Tourists are negotiating about a ditch and return to “Millionary Quarter”
Several of the most emerging owners of homes in the English county of West Midland are reinstated with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities on the right to regain the field for their seats.
The tourists parked 20 caravans in the field at a rising street in Solihull, which is called the “military neighborhood”.
By bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists return after they were delivered in May. They were not afraid of a hill that was dug on the site under the authority's order to prevent their attack.
A group of tacticals found spaces in defense and penetrated on the field with the caravans of the unprotected space that served for the journey.
The raged inhabitants of the neighborhood attacked the council of Solihull, with the fact that “he is not able to solve the problem.”
One of the residents who wanted to stay anonymously saying: “They planted the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones on other people.
The Management Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All tourists were moved to a different place, and now they're back.
There's another one arrived last night and there's probably more to come today.'
She added that : “Birmingham’s Management Board knows how to impose this problem. He uses judicial orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't want to keep paying taxes until the tourist board has dealt with.'
Another anonymous resident said: “It’s ridiculous. We have recently watched the last traveling tourists, and now they're back.
And this time, there are even more, and this time, they brought the horses with them.'
The spokesperson of the Board of Directors of Solihull said: “We are aware of the unlawful residence on the property near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police we are taking the necessary legal steps to solve the problem.
In order to gather as many evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many local residents report any non-social or illegal behaviour of the police at heading 101.
We'll get a total picture we'll put in court.'
Marriage of the euro-person hit a car in Brussels.
The government special brought him in.
The government special was transported by the injured Róbert Žitňansky to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under constant control of the Slovak doctors.
He's been around for a long time without complications.
Róbert Žitňanski, according to the information TV JOJ, had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He said he's been hit by a car, and he's been in a serious state since then.
After transporting to the country, he was transported to a specialised workplace of one of the brotherly hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak Europerson of Jana Žitňanská by NOVA.
She didn't want to say anything about the incident.
He's got three kids together.
The Italians are strengthening the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has notified that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships that arrive at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO has signed new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German Rescue organization Jugend Rettet because of the suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which significantly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of the allegation by the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us it is and will always be the priority number one rescue of human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at present," said the organization in the statements on social networks.
"All current accusations can be commented only after the gathering of all information and the evaluation of the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have followed the Iuventa Jugend Rettet ship since October.
Her crew is suspicious of the transfer of immigrants directly handed them over to the ship, repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the file of the prosecutor, it was allegedly only 1,3 miles from the coast of Libya. The Italian media published the course of the meeting.
The ship's crew is suspicious of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian coast guard that supervises rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct establishes the presence of the Italian police officer on board a ship such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have yet agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last appointed organisation on Thursday stated that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not constitute any ‘relevant change or obstacle’ as regards rescue operations.
The adoption of the new Code of Conduct, for example, has also rejected the organisation of non-frontier doctors (MSF), which is the Nobel Prize holder.
Meanwhile, Minniti had heard that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks, which were landing in Italy in the framework of rescue operations, suggests that the efforts to strengthen patrols at the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors bring fruit.
“In recent days, we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with Mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
She had a silicone and cellulitis coming from the overal!
Hot summer days are totally tempted to take the most necessary things to cover the most intent particle.
Only Dominica Mesaroš does it the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers, and everyone who's got to do with TV Prima, they're just silent, they're covered in the mini-time.
And just a few routine moves and a model showed everyone their silicones, but also a butt.
Because how many times he cut between her half, and he erased her so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
The attention of the masters and photographers present was definitely unnecessary.
Michelle Carter sentenced to send text messages to Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusets was sentenced to deprived of freedom in two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is sitting 15 months away from a two-year sentence behind bars and then spending five years on parole release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision.
She was threatened by 20 years of detention, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood to declare the judgment on the spot with tears in the eyes, tight hands and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her conduct killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said the judge.
“ She ended her life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has not revealed any remorse."
However, Advocate Carter said that these were “unhappy circumstances that he regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “the age or level of maturity or even mental disorder have no significant impact on its conduct”.
The applicant read the statement of Roy's mother Lynn Roy: “There will not be one day for me not to grieve the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters, and together we will bear the great pain that we will bear with us forever," he stood in the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was “consecuted” by the knowledge that she would never take part in his brother's wedding and never be a aunt of his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since my birth is the pain that I'll carry on my life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no valid law for a person to assist the suicide of another person, so this case is based on a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found at the car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide in 2014.
The case attracted attention to the whole nation after Carter's text reports were published, which motivated suicide.
"I don't care if you both jump out of the building or stab yourself," wrote in text messages that Carter sent away just two weeks before she died when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before suicide, she wrote to him: “You must do it, Conrade,” and “It's just a power generator, and you'll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter was eager to pay attention through Roy's death and ordered her to stop any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who stood up for Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was discharged.
Miss Knox (30) published the statements in Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audis adjust up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Only one day before the notification of the Audi of the BMW car manufacturer stated that it will offer its customers an update of software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
President BMW said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driver restrictions” in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the BMW headquarters - which consider the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision as withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted a great measure the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide that releases diesel engines is considered as carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of cars to install equipment to neutralise gas emitted by diesel engines, which reduces the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are facing a thorough examination, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges for spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen errors, which attempted to meet the emission limits installed in their cars the software that reduced the number of emissions issued, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several higher representatives of Volkswagen have been accused in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, he would have been arrested in Germany by the former head of the thermodynamics department of engine development in Audi.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, the Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German police in Volkswagen automotive after the authorities accused the Audi of the installation of the system, which was intended to circumvent the European emission limits - and so extended the charges the Audi are facing in the US.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a miserable impact on Volkswagen: the luxurious car manufacturer constitutes an indirect share of Volkswagen’s profit.
An emergency plane landed on the beach.
The man and the girl were killed.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica, approximately 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the Witnesses in the SIC Noticias television channel said that the plane flew just over the people on the beach.
Some people of the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
On the beach according to local media, a 50-year-old man died and an eight-year-old girl.
"The plane hit them, and they were dead on the spot," says the local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them came out of an accident alive, and the cops took them to interrogation.
D11 or how I can't build a highway.
And the highways in the Czech Republic are even complete?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's unfinished, even though it began to build in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly corrected.
And it can't go on, even if it has a construction permit.
What's that?
Yes, castle highway D11.
The construction of the next section of it has recently stopped the Kids of Earth movement for at least a few months.
We easterns get a highway on pieces like rolling salami.
They'll cut the wheel, and then they'll just see when and if we get another one.
At the same time, we don't want anything wonderful.
We just want to shorten the time of driving and we want to get the camps to Poland or Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of the campsites are going right through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a reasonable ride.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was operated in 2008, so before the incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock ever since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section of the Hradec of the Kings began with an archaeological exploration that would begin at the end of this year, you could hear in the eastern Bohemia loud bumping.
Nobody believed it anymore.
Last week, it turns out he won't be standing this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Movement Country-Klub for Sustainable Transport from Brno has been decompositioned.
The children of Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked decisions on a whole range of construction permits.
In decomposition, they shall request a review of all already issued binding opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the county Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Dracing Office.
So so far, the D11 is leaving near the village with an excuse name The burial.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road and we prefer to then put ourselves in a column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
A scary, constantly blocked road to Benešov, D1 or D8.
Everyone's got their burial.
What do the children of the Earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the current highway network virtually incomplete?

Levandule of the Provence threatens climate change
The Levandules have become a symbol of the South-Eastern Provence of France, but they are now threatened with climate change.
The Levandules remained as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, which causes scary on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The farming of the Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change that brings less precipitation in spring and autumn.
That affects the life of the lavender.
They also have the guilt of cicats and locusts translating micro-bacteries that are in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
The lavender attracts tourists and oil, which is made of them, is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is obviously smaller."
A possible solution can be more effective distribution of water and slowing down water washing from the soil, but also spraying of the levandules of the protective mixture of grain and water and breeding of more types of water-resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist stresses the growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the Riodoce weekly are regularly gathered on Wednesdays to discuss the news of the disturbances that are taking place in the Sinaloa area for the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and unhappy drug wars.
However, today, under the challenge of recent events, mainly because of its own safety.
They find it important to change their habits.
Two worthy journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with you to the office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black board: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to put names on every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and prestige.
Choosing them from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - the catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal negotiations.
Violence does not stand up, and the bodies rise to a pillar across the entire country; journalists keep coming among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists there are at least 25 from the success of President Enrique Pen Niet to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also the co-founder of Riodioce periodicals, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence that comes with drug trafficking.
His loss is valuable, even though his presence is all-performing - a large photograph of Valdeza with the title "Right", which shows the median, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - age over 30 years, have a shirt with photos of Valdeze with smile on the face, glasses on the nose and hat Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; the journalists are talking about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecution was established in 2010 in order to address the cases of journalists, so far, according to the opinion of the Committee on the Protection of journalists, two suspects were sued.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to the drug business and organised crime.
The Riodoce journalists insist that they will inform about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe, even though they are devastated by the grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without justice, the security meeting is unprecedented, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time for such meetings," he adds to it.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On 15 May Valdez left the Riodoce headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
The shooters then joined his car and crashed it near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left a woman and two grown-up kids behind.
Looks like a rumor spreads quickly in Culiacan.
However, in Valdez's case, silence is suspicious.
Since last year's arrest, Guzman and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody fighters in the country trying to fill the rival fractures.
A few people have been killed every day in Sinaloi streets and a cemetery is filled with two-story mausolees for the kings of drugs, many of which are bigger than houses.
For a moment, the word “determination” is thought that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes to which they travel to the United States of drugs.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was confidentially familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce continues to mention that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two doubts have contributed to his death.
The first edition of February was the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The covenant may have been angry with the sons; suspected members of the gang have kicked all copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad and is seen as an important milestone in combating Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In Noroeste periodical he was practically veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and start with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to operate a newspaper without mentioning drug trafficking,” said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true intelligence; the newspapers began to succeed.
Newspapers liked to search for problems and publish texts without censorship - the readers fascinated reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious award of Maria Moors Cabot for the report on Latin America.
The same year Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Committee for the Protection of journalists for his brave news about Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez admitted he was scared.
“I was worried about my life,” said when the price was accepted.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is "the way of life," said Valdez in October last year in interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You must take the role of a journalist or play a fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What have you done with the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relyed on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: has this routine caused his death?
His death in them also raised questions about its own assumptions - how to do his job as best and to remain alive?
"They don't like to enter with their women, their children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
“These things were forbidden,” said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-esteem.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel there's something wrong, get your hands off.
The problem is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “something is a sense that can be fooled... and then there was a thing with Javier.”
The old rules according to him, like others, in Sinaloae no longer apply - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones in the room with the Riodoce employees; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, who bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two police officers find a relief outside the building before a 40-degree vedar in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in the four-story building in Culiacan district.
Newspapers are teasing to see if these policemen aren't 50 percent of the defenders of the law, who are, according to the statement of the government, corrupt.
It's been a few months since the journalists last went to the mountainous areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
First of them is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloe.
They also have suspicious government expenditures that were held in the home city of the Governor of the State.
A few kidnappings have recently occurred in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the D.A.'s office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the journalists were paying attention when they were going to write about what every city resident knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public record that the restaurant was registered under the name that is linked to a certain policy that is a member of the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scene almost the past century.
Several governors of PRI have recently been accused of corruption at high posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident where one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in Valdez's version, which was the best source of kidnapping information.
"Valdez would surely solve the case," said Villarreal (46), which is called "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a signroom and sticker to protest against the killing of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went demonstrating in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist the following morning.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacan.
The authorities claim it's Adamea's DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is declining across the country and many of them organise protests and stare at the sidewalks and buildings of the “SOS press”.
The head of the newspaper Bojorquez is a day to visit Washington, where he is trying to get international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to transfer to another department to fear that her anger might jeopardise her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly pointed out that Mexican journalists were “obstructed” by organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism" wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by ordering politicians and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The Media Supervisory Group Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all the attacks on journalists of police officers and public officers.
“In Mexico you will die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one forgets the death of Marie Elizabeth Macías blogger, which happened six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that allegedly signed the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages.”
Next to the cut-off head, there were keyboards and headphones.
Some branches have decided to terminate the activity, such as the El Norte newspaper, based on the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslav Breach.
The others are still continuing, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartels of the article on the opening page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists escaped from their homes or even across the border.
It's an easy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just like getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruza.
For those who have decided to stay and give up their work, every day, it represents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, which is why I became a journalist," said.
It's Friday night, and Riodoce's employees sit on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when they suddenly start ringing the phone.
19 people died in the shooting between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just like it was promised by many messages left by syndicate members in this area.
Newspapers publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
There will not be one day, and the introductory title will change again.
The sounds of police siren show another shot.
Bojorquez's taking a summer look at the police patrol to see if they're careful.
If they're afraid, they're not showing up.
Under the huge portrait of a fallen co-founder of their periodicals - whose middleboat is an excuse slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all the employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How can we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first sight, it looks like a statue, whatever scary.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first findings of a wonderful creature about the size of a rhinoceros whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were maintained so high that experts were able to determine red-colored color of his scrubbing skin and said that dinosaurus had a “problemous past.”
The article in the Current Biology magazine stated that it was “the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the world’s best kinds of dinosaura.”
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the Křída period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him as “remarkably remarkable.”
The Defenced Whitebird according to National Geographic is the best preserved stone of its species.
Shawn Funk is behind the foundation, which revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011 in drilling down Suncor Millenium near Canada Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a stranger and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from an enormous piece of the country weighting 1100 kg.
After the work is done, the dinosaurus is ready for detection.
“She's going to sink a little eyes and believe that he's asleep,” said Caleb Brown's head of work, and the Nature Museum of Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly be written into history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved kinds of dinosaura - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin researchers found that this herbivore - although he was covered by the armor and reminded the walking tank - with great probability he faced a serious threat from the massive dinosaurs.
Heavily armored dinosaurus used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and use a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts claim that it allowed him to get better together with his surroundings and avoid the enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a popular dish of larger dinosaurs.
Reports about 110 million years old dinosaurus Nodosauridae's heads first appeared in the papers in May. It is currently available to visit the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli after the technician of Mark Mitchell's museum, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team with a careful discovery of the fossil.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved state of phosphorus, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document patterns and shapes of shampoo and armor all over the body.
They discovered the method of masking that the animals used today in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part of it.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size is far beyond today's animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that dinosaurus was such a number of predators that evolution had given priority to confrontation when survival.
Many present animals with a masking - the coupon of deer, zebras and or belts - are much smaller and also vulnerable as a prey, which suggests that nosodaurus had to fight for his survivors literally.
“The grave and hardly armored dinosaur predators illustrated the dangers of the predators during the chalk period,” said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scorpions also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely to have red-colored.
Researchers continue to study the animal and seek further knowledge of his life, including the preserved stomach content, to explore his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaurus fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea where he sank to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta, the climate was the same as in today's Florida and rivers and the oceans went far beyond the inland than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in a perfectly preserved scattered skin while maintaining it in three dimensions and so you can see its original size,” said Brown.
“For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct him; you just squeeze your eyes a little, and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the chalk period, there were huge teropodi, massacre dinosaurs, who were moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaurus could have been the favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 meters long monster with weight over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the Current Biology magazine, believe that the body of Borealopelta was spilled into the sea after it was mummified in the mummified mud.
Shawn Funk is behind the foundation, which revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011 in drilling in the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canada Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the garlic to the hip.
The animal averaged 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He's got two or 50 cm stitches out of his shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herbivore has wiped the territory of today's Canada until he ended up in the river that sailed him into the sea.
His submarine grave preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also maintained to the extent that armored skulls still cover the residues of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the meeting of the preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are also maintained to the extent that armored skulls still cover the residues of the skin.
By his side, his right front leg lies with his fingers headed up.
I'll easily count the drawers on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets?”
August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell shattered all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
At the same time, she ran into a student of high school.
“Policie just shot an 18-year-old young man, whose body was still on the street,” he stood there.
She wondered that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall allowances.
Rapper of St. Louis published his posts on Twitter about Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old young man, who shot a white skin cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which lies in control on the street, from where no one took it even after four hours.
"That's crazy," she thought Ferrell.
Death was nothing new for her and her community.
She postponed her phone to return to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
She watched photographs of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed that he was the victim's father and held a sign in hand with the sign "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched live news - one of the cops stood in front of a protest group, holding a lead in her hand and at his second end of a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, as she said, held a weapon that he aimed at the crowd and screamed: “I will kill you all... animals.”
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
“This is not the kind of murder we used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She immediately ordered a return flight and went home the second day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story about what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson during the next three years describes the new document "Whose Streets?" which will be placed in the cinema on 11 August.
It's a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and fragileness, told from the view of people living in the community who are going to the streets and demanding answers.
On the way to Ferguson, the Ferrell dialogue with her daughter - dressed in the flower dres and the same flower fronters - about the topic that they discussed many times before - "the experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed?" He recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"It was not considered that I would not take it with me," said Ferrell later.
“Today events are a culmination... that happened in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also had to know the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with the conditions in which racism does not affect its own skin, it does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel like if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After coming to Ferguson, the first stop of South Florissant Road was on the other side of the police department, which became the base of activists who were expecting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible participation in the incident.
This is where Ferrell met her daughter with a local businessman who prepared for other foods.
Together, they put food in the bags and helped him spread to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9th," said Ferrell, and added that when she studied at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association and tried to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met her later director Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “only document” the ongoing events.
However, Ferrell thought: “Do you work on a document or try to find a story that can be used?”
Such a type of scepticism penetrated into the community through many people, often white men who wanted to make money for pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in a recent conversation: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and grow up in Ferguson are very often forgotten, and that is what we wanted to change. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-author Damon Davis, a recognized local artist who is dealing with the subject of prisoners in the death cell.
His participation in the project was also inspired by Ferrell and the other six local residents, followed by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following the murder of Brown.
"In this document, no one speaks for us, but it's our statement," said Davis.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience - in trying to show that the movement “not about the savior leader, but on the closerness of the community,” said Folayan - it turned out that she was the most open to the participation in filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of the Ferrell life, an example of how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face when she thought about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that, in order to do this job and to polish the blacks, I must open up."
The Ferrell story also emphasizes the role of an eccentric black woman in a wider aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of a teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - they call themselves weirdos.
“The black ecclesiastical women on the leading positions ultimately stand behind the maintenance of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this expression and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.”
However, it insists that “this is not just an acknowledgemental matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It was the driving force and energy source," said.
“ that she just found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the power blow even in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of the television stations have removed their positions, but the heavy racial bonds between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell takes two and a half-year-old condition for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area called the home described as "The Disorder."
Yet he does not stand in his efforts, which she committed since she went to Ferguson Street three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains."
The field was burned in Kolin.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, helicopter helped.
Near the Czech Brod in Cologne, between the villages of Zona and Liblice, the field of about 15 hectares was burned from 14:00.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firemen reported the third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the spokesman of Ladislav Holomčík, he's helped fire from the air to fire even a helicopter.
At 18:00 the firemen managed to put the fire away, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
With the flames on the spot, dozens of professional and voluntary firemen were fighting.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine compartment of the chamber.
Hasit also helped a helicopter, who made six drops of water.
"We've handed over the owner's place until tomorrow 8:00 he'll be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," said the Holomčík today.
A Becoming Resemblance: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the Fridman Gallery of New York, several faces of the various shades of the skin - white, black and eaten - hanged from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them is as though the previous one fell out of the eye.
All 30 portraits made by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the oral cavity and the hair she sent to her Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where your former analyst repays 35-year-old penalty for unauthorized publication of secret cableograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, informatic and art, and Manning - a trans-sexual and pioneer dissident, whose punishment reduced Obama three days before leaving the U.S. President's post.
Algorithmic analysis of DNA Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a man would look like with this genotype, created Dewey-Hagborg abdominal, if not an intellectual comment on DNA subjection - as well as many ways as DNA can be interpreted - and irresponsible determination of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been speaking since the youth about being considered to be a woman. She was judged in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including the violation of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were held by the staff of the prison. Only one black and white photograph escaped in the lower quality where Manning, clearly concerned, is sitting on the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig that is now connected to.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 Stranger Visions continued to respond positively.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and gum inflammations - to create an image of the possible likes of these people.
And at this time, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They were interviewing Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add the article to the portrait,” explained Dewey-Hagborg at the opportunity to open the new exhibition.
However, the visits or photographs were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea to ask if she was interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were friends in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who introduced a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was admired and could attend the exhibition personally.
President Obama really requested the release of Manning a few days after the comic book was released, which was welcomed to change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition takes place just at a time when Donald Trump leads a war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stimulate his tweets to incite obstacles in areas that should support.
In answer to the question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything is happening for some reason.”
Under the statement of an artist on one of the walls of the gallery calls Manning with her huge signature (the "i" in the last name is a heart-treated one) after the end of the “security fracture that is based on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the opposite side there is a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA - hundreds of letters C, G and A recorded with pencil.
By sorting 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we all are.
"I hope that people will take away from this that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data are subjective, and everyone can interpret them on their own," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her work is also Spurious Memories from 2007 on the video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
Shows Manning, which is the way King Kong comes from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in hand.
"When they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never be silent."
“It is a direct transcript from one of the letters,” said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, it's scary."
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition personally - which was foretold in the comic book - but when it happens, she will be welcomed in the center of the room by her masks, by her own genome similarities, as a crowd of protesters.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm of the Maning Sculpture, on which the pencil is recorded by its genetic haploskupins.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to salute the feeling of the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to impress a mass movement that would take the form of Chelsea and liberate it."
Professor Sevestern University and employee of the University of Oxford looking for murder
On these days there is a national search for Professor Self-Western University and employees of the University of Oxford who are being prosecuted for suspected murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, said the police.
On Monday, an arrest warrant for the murder of a first-grade man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County court records.
It says in the document that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police said that the body of the dead was found on July 27th.
The police have been alerted to this fact by telephone. After arrival in Grand Plaza Apartments, they have found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and the detectives are investigating a case like a murder.
Lathem has worked as a doc of microbiology and immunology from the Sewer West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University for Public Relations, in his e-mail statement, stated that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is currently under investigation of the competent authorities and the Self-American University fully collaborates with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the Oxford University.
The University spokesperson and Somerville College stated in the statement sent by e-mail: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of contact with the public of the Chicago police department, said that he calls on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"Policie has information about the place of their stay and the efforts to explore suspects are declining," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added to it that, in a search for suspects, local, regional and national authorities are helping the police.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the head of the Grand Plaza building, which was alerted to the events that were supposed to happen in apartment 1008.
The police described the whole scene as a very violent one.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether an incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza headquarters issued a statement for all residents: “Policie is now working to draw up a timeline and profile of the victim and investigates various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the early future we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) and to re-establish the Russian anti-doping Agency (RUSADA).
‘At the present time, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka the code does not contain anything to concern Russia.
“All has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA at the earliest time," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls upon the public notification of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, on alleged doping by the government of Russian athletes.
Mutko said: “We are investigating because our antidoping system has obviously failed.
It was attached to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country, and we cannot confess to something that has never existed."
Mutko's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public antidoping Commission.
In an interview for Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian antidoping agents, but added: “In many occasions, we have said that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov finished.
The WADA suspected RUSADU from carrying up doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and uniting of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD) this year in June.
After visiting the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that the RUSADA is “on the right way” to restore validity.
The police accused three people, one's a juvenile.
The police accused three men of setting up a rare wooden church in the Trinity-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místnice.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
For the criminal offence of general danger, they're at risk for up to 15 years of prison.
The Moravian police director Tomáš Kužel told the journalists today.
He thinks it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter, and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Kužel.
He said that the police would be dealing with a possible pleading of the accused.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"I can't tell much so far, because the criminal police and investigation services are actually working on things," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Mass damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is invaluable.
After the fire, it started to think about the restoration of the church.
Most costs should cover insurance, additional costs are ready to share the Ministry of Culture and the city, also a public collection is prepared and counts with the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Katerina from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed fire 15 years ago.
It caused an electro-installation failure then.
In his place, there were accurate copies.
The state counts on citizens defending the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations used in the defence of the State, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, the factual purpose of the Act on the Preparation of citizens to defend the State is calculated.
The Ministry of Defence, which his processing has been tasked by the government, promises him to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their skills that could then be used in crisis situations.
It's coming out of the proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law was adopted in the future, the State would have spent hundreds of millions of crowns to support the bravery.
According to his authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of the gateway obligations and on the basis of voluntaryness.
For example, the State would support radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists in financial or material and enable them to increase the capacity of their members.
On the contrary, it would obtain data on people who are willing to lose the country, if necessary, at the time of the crisis, to help, and their ability or material equipment.
Accredited guides could also be available to help the associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also involves organising besed with war veterans or people who act heroically.
One possible variant assumes that a new office should be responsible for managing and coordinating the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the State would use their capacities only after the announcement of the state of danger.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual scrubbing of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," states in the intention of referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
The ministerial officials pointed out that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not only the military.
"The basic objective is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or of life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, if necessary to contribute to the protection of others, and to not make it difficult for each citizen to carry out the tasks of armed forces of the Czech Republic," states the intention.
Adoption of the law would bring little financial entitlements.
Their amount according to the Ministry will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordinating centre was established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
Another money would be on salary or building an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the Regional Military Headquarters would have to be extended to work together for 42 more soldiers.
Ministerial Directors have already stated that the law should also help solve disagreement between certain Czech politicians with the introduction of a directive of the European Union on arms holding.
Its acceptance would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive suggests.
Starts that help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find an appropriate survey.
Answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even deceiving.
And even though she promised anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their disbelief in the whole process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, the owner of the e-commerce of the company's haircare Madison Reed, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New starts from human resources are constantly appearing in the market, helping companies to explore the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licensing of software with a specific intention of measuring employees' obligations enables companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer an absolute anonymousity of employees and a hot line for complaints, and, in some cases, also allow informants to circumvent the superiors and contact the director directly.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit, which are watching your health condition, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Director-General of startup Glint with headquarters in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness of what her employees thought and what she felt in three years.
In addition to rapid surveys and votes of specific teams, Glint offers a warmth map of society and a regular overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low rating managers - which allows users to work on corrections.
Companies are beginning to realise that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in the event that another Uber would be made of them - which is thrown out in scandals after the former employee published a contribution on his blog describing the corporate environment and the harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compatibility sectors can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The launch Convercent of Denver in the state of Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and reveal inappropriate behavior, has seen a small increase in interest and activities at the beginning of the year, just before Uber's scandals.
Almost 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wings.
Similarly, Glint allows Convercent companies to send tailorable lightning surveys, collect confidential information in real-time and display the temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Justice has authorised regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of Convercent startup.
If the company is convicted of misconduct with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if regulators do not step up - it can face costly consequences due to the fight of customers, the exhaustion of employees or court proceedings, he added Quinlan.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to increase the awareness of employees of corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to supervise a phone number or e-mail to the company's management, officially lodge a complaint and hope in a seeming solution.
Often it was a disgusting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy General Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no reliable way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it is ensured a rapid detection and settlement of problems that have never reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual complaints solution - a purchase of discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It is approaching the holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday group in charge of risk management.
"We are also protecting shareholders from judicial disputes by employees."
The companies ceased to take ethics, values and participation of employees in light weight in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed after the fall of Enron in the abuse of ethical rights of employees, said Quinlan.
But only when “the social media were on the whole thing,” the companies began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
“Since people were used to monitor technology ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose his February company campaign as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital total $10 million and eventually took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million during the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising in view of the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more than ever.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects is not.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoted to their time of society seeking a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they see their voice being heard, and their work is rewarding, they seek the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and the benefits of employees of LinkedIn, who use Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies prosper if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when the analytical tool is on the market that ensures the involvement and commitment of employees to society, it is no wonder that many investors will be found to support this effort.
According to experts in the work culture, it is important to have data on staff's satisfaction.
But the data itself is ineffective if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that as soon as the company asks for feedback by its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"When you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," Russell Raath said, the head of consulting at Kotter International, who was witnessed by many companies who were too relieved on lonely data.
“Because as soon as you don’t get to the end, the staff will start asking the question: ‘ Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I be interested?'
Madison Reed, which is currently regularly conducting a survey between employees every month, can solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, said Errett.
Following the gathering of feedback from workers who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganize several teams within the company and start training of communication to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gains a very important view of its employees and hopes that, in the long term, it will achieve high employment in the field, which is known for frequent releases.
“If you do not seek to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you,” said Vitrano.
“And once you start losing your employees, you will lose your customers.
And with the odds of customers, the entire company is ruined."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watchtower in Hodonsk the warmest day of the year in Czech Republic.
He survived the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed the Czech hydrometeorological institutes about this.
Apart from Tuesday on Thursday, there were no many temperature records.
Vedra hit mainly Morava, in Bohemia was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, the records were overwhelmed or settled to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years.
Only nine long-term metering stations were recorded on Thursday.
Like the Watchtower today, the temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclavsk today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four ten degrees and in Pohoříce in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tens.
Both records, just like the Watchtower, came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and the east of Moravia.
After the Guardian was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyjí in Brzeclavsk, where rtumbly climbed at 37.8 degrees, but the record didn't cross.
On the other hand, for example, in the western and northwest Bohemia, the highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees of Celsia, according to the ČHMÚ website.
"The heaters started to grow there until later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current vedars in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to the CHMÚ, and on Sundays even more significant rains could come.
Most of Moravia's locations will remain high temperatures on Friday and on the southeast of Moravia and Saturday.
We've got this kind of scattered in here.
The billionaires don't get the same voice in elections as any one full-year-old in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because they're not all as different as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they're buying political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues on the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškovy Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and entrepreneur in the real estates, Paul Sehnal, who is also his chairman.
The condemned corrupter and king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valento have arranged a Party of Privates.
The political movement of Agrofert, as Andrei Babiš’s project did not want to name except the Mayor of Rome, is a chapter for himself.
His billionaires recently caught the Mayors too.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company for the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he goes into politics to do good.
The Entrée in the mayor's jersey didn't do much to the grandfather.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," said at the press conference.
That means my goal is to move ANO to get the Starship movement in elections 20 percent.
Leckdo's laughing.
The grandfather's renouncement is rather symptomatic.
Miliardary Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to seek voters in the Mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babisha in previous parliamentary elections.
"The Bababish is not a shooting speaker and is not a politician of political snakes," wrote about it before 2013.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
For me, Babish will remain the hero.
He's willing to get out of his world that's under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented it as a new reinforcement, he learned from his admiration to Babish again.
And he said that he wanted the mayors to learn how to co-operate with Babish.
Some may appreciate that the grandfather does not change his views and stands for himself regardless of what dres he wears.
Others can speculate whether Babiš is sending to the mayors to build his bull like this.
Others may ask if the boss of Jablotron and the boss of Agrofert did not break up in bad business and seek another way to defend his business rival.
But the first grandfather's public performance didn't just turn around Babish.
Grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard to stop by a similar statement.
After all, the judged gauner Zdeněk Bakala was throwing millions on all sides before the elections in 2010.
The political division of the security agency of the Vita Bárty, TOP 09, and civil Democrats came together in this way to nearly thirty million.
But today is another time.
The law prohibits any political party to give more than three million.
When the grandfather enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe you wouldn't have to ask yourself why politics have such a bad reputation with us.
He then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax benefit for families with studied children.
People with college education will come to us for about 50,000 a month.
They're basic with less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in these ratios.
The one with the 20s poor.
In the Grandfather's vision, poor companies pay taxes honestly and rich ones enjoy the benefits of the social state in which they do not share too much.
The rich one is simply needed to help them not to drown the poverty of the needy.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions, and Babish keep your hands with me.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there's still a question of who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the State for their employees and for their own property.
Finally, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have leveraged by 234 million.
Sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And many times he can't help 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that he sells the property to the President of the United States Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down about the incredible 8 million pounds.
He informed the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says, "Hey, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid a place like no other.
But even the connection of the real estate company with the American president did not defend an extreme price.
Donald Trump must have reduced the price of his Caribbean residence with an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to £13 million.
So even after the sale of the villa complex, it costs about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And there's nothing to blame.
The delightful seat of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The pool and tennis court are part of the property.
Tens of palms are planted on the property.
The terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed that the connection with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual prices of property on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was supposed to be bought for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin Island.
But with a new price, it ranks in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
NCAA has decided to quit with two trainings a day. For Bruins, long days have come.
The eleventh morning and US football players in the UCLA University are at the sideline of a new school playground.
Some of them take off the jerseys and reveal sweaty back, a misguided sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the members of this team, nothing does is supplemented by a lunch break.
Players posted in the summer semester will go to rooms after three hours training to study for final tests before returning to Wasserman Football Center to a meeting that takes place at 6:30 a.m.
"For these boys, there will be a big macaque next three days," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora a minute before Monday went on Tuesday.
By erasing two trainings on one day, NCAA wants to lighten the players - paradoxically the training days are even longer - at least until Friday when the final exams are finished.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to seal into so overcrowded journals of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons that Mora spent at the position of a coach in Westwood, Bruins' training camp starts a week before last year and training is limited for the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one daily.
18 trainings are scheduled in total by August 20, beginning formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora was heard to support the NCAA decision, even though it added another item to the already loaded record of players.
“Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them,” said Mora.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying, they're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking and luxurious hotel Luskin Center, which have settled the players after harvesting the protection network behind the gate bar.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by security service," said Mora.
“The security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
He's doing good business with that kind of material.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard security as well as parking 8.
We'll use it to maximize our resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans a more thorough control of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and show the findings under the original contributions in the effort to combat the so-called "fake news" said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company in the statement on its website writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes to send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook was named as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the last year's election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debates are being carried out. The French voters are flooded by avalanche of false reports of May's presidential elections, and Germany plans to place fines before the lighting choices on the social media network if it quickly does not remove angerous contributions.
On Thursday, in its next statement published in Germany, Facebook stated that it was going to launch a new test function for the control of false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"According to the messages verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to decide correctly on what they can share," said Sara Su, the product reporting manager of Facebook.
It added that Facebook continues to test the function of ‘related articles’ and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Create graphic novel: story about A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle has recently played a major role in the Squeeze music video and its refuge in it also found Margaret Thatcher during the 70s and 80s of the last century.
However, Scotney was a witness from his cozy place near the Bewl River in the British Kent for 700 years of stormy history that inspired the dreadful Jamie Rhodes from York county - a well-known supplication in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The view of a man who is 300 years after death is fascinating me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The Graphical novel A Castle in England documents the life of families that lived in the castle of Scotney from the medieval to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), the collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for Jacobbity," he said.
“This is a fingerprint of his thumb!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in times, you had to burn a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, the support by the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying almost four months in the castle as a dream. ("To tell the truth, I've had a little longer stay.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Viktorian “new” castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and curiosity, such as the head of hyena on the wall and bottles, which were thrown for centuries in the hill.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke with the rich, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
In the night, “he drank whiskey and wrote.”
Scotney's trustworthy history is a relatively large unknown, since the National Trust organization gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees were just beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “aristocratic many centuries scattered their hands with the words: “Take it to the attic.”
Journals, letters from the British empire, maps showing property: “You may think that the dispute about land is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I encountered one case when two families were stretching about the burden.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and bounce deeper into the English history, including the story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a record of the rebellion in 1380 Castle, called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“ The English rebellion actually began in this area and I thought that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe he's somehow connected."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who had been hiding Darrell's family for seven years during the English reformation.
Or The Smuggler about the smuggler of the 18th century named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly inspired his own funeral when he filled the coffin of the stone (which was found only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell: “I was intrigued by men’s generations - men were always debtors and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The various generations of the Darrell family have dealt with taking rich or old ladies - I imagine that they were handsome gentlemen who were delicately mowing their heads to the heirs."
With the end of the castle, Rhodes is looking for other adventures.
Recently, he came back from a two-week job in the Finnish wilderness where he was inspiring for his next book about Elämänmäki, which is an ex-sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, "Now I'm going back to real life."
Washington changes the terms of granting green cards
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the new US immigration plan, which will also change in the award of a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 annually as a result of stricter rules for the granting of temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules suggest the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and this will change the rules on the issue of green cards to the residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prefer the English speaking applicants who will pose financial resources and show the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 cannot be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) has recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to the former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and the co-founder of the FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the look of robot nails.
"People are pulling them off, but sales are growing and we need to be ready to see them more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from an inflatable master to robotic women with a silicone skin that is pleasant to the touch - of course is an artificial intelligence that imitates the behavior of man.
The user can "adjust" the robot to its image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own "personality" that would embarrass even Stepford's lady.
Modern inflatable virgins evolved in robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the robot RealBotix can set up a variety of character features between them and shame.
And then there's a Roxxxy Gold's sexual robot woman with True Companion, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including a "frigid Farrah", which is a resenting nature and "different Wendy" with a "good" character.
"Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality to the maximum possible extent," writes on the True Companion website.
She therefore likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, conversational, or "in the mood".
The rise in sexual robots is alarming for just a few reasons - among which the transformations do not belong for real human relationships. The worrying are rather undermined female character features and violent raids - such as frigid (read resistance) Farrah.
True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"When a woman can have a vibrator, why can't he have a Roxxxy man?" writes on the page.
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication show something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - remove from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for undermanaged sex with optional incision.
Of course, most men do not buy a robot woman, and while the FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain at the edge of the interest of the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror of the current modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're given a free market excuse.
There is no way that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world enjoy their rights, and in the White House are sitting the president, who often expresses themselves very keenly at the address of the woman.
The most terrible aspect of the story of the maid's story is not what we see - hanging bodies and scattered eyes, like the reality of these visions.
Book advance The story of the maid is a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are supposed to be like the real women as much as possible.
Their creators construct them in such a way that they are pleasant to touch and affect the first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that inspires their independence or distorts their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
They say the 21st century: the servants.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for cut in California.
Stephen Curry's star basketball player did not lose his first shot during the premiere start among professional golfers.
Two-fold award holder for the most useful NBA player played on Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California Hayward first round for 74 rounds and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won second title in NBA with team Warriors, started a lot nervous, and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at Fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as accurate as he was under the basketball basketball basketball basketball basketball, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four wounds over couples.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, he had to call the referee right after the first launch, but then he had a little sit down," Curry said that he fell on him a huge trém.
It was very nervous to fire the first shot on the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 at the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry can fight with cut, which will probably set two wounds below a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the triumphs, it may be possible," said an enthusiastic golfer who has already played celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts the first tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic gained a sponsorship exception and maintained amateur status.
Series Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of sound mind.
The uncomfortable sign of Trump's era becomes political deliberations that divide the American voters and also rip out the entire family on a micro scale.
At Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was in the American papers that hedged with advice, how to deal with relatives who voted Trump.
We're supposed to just wait for the nerves to allow us.
However, less attention is given to the Trump family’s ability to stmelate.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, poet and fan of the left, who lives in Chicago, visited me this week in New York, and paid for a Republican fool for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that the fate faced in the face of a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican siblings with whom she has been fighting about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm surprised that in a wider context it represents a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidentialism has the power to push us all to the right.
Speaking of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his chasheres can lose to attractiveness one day.
However, there is a more horrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing republicans who, by opposing its standards, will be abused by the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy conduct - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (but we had awareness of his tax confession) - of which both examples look like a very mild offence compared to Trump.
After Trumpa's departure, it is sufficient to be a subsequent Republican candidate at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and we took children to Central Park on the largest carousel that operates the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are a tremendous, middle roller is covered with glasslauni - clowns and animals are filmed and in horror look at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and a gypsy music of the divinely reminds of public transport.
Many clichés will soon be frozen: view from height buildings, panorama will look at, instead of breathing at you with the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
35 years later, I still did not move over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - does not actually count the thematic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the London Metro Station.
However, the Colocist in Central Park brings a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two two-year-old children will enjoy it, as well as two mature women.
Fortunately, no one asks.
I've had a similar experience this week in the store when I was asked to evaluate my “excellence” on a scale of one to five when I was paid by a credit card.
It's the same in the cafe at the corner of my street, with the difference that I can throw 15% tip for something I can buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the fast sale otherwise, but the waitress is forced to hack into strictly shopping if it's not necessary.
A woman at the store apologized with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my passing credit cards with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated because of the wounds on the wrist that he caused himself after the prison was fallen in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing against the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning at Valentine's Day in 2013 several shot wounds through the door of the toilet closet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said you were wrong about the thief.
The applicants announced their intention to revoke, this time against the six-year Penalty, which according to their words is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius threatens to extend the penalty until 15 years.
In South Africa, the death penalty is not valid.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity of a panda who was committed in a wilderness.
It's a huge success for the Pand rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genophoned of the pands kept in captivity.
The worker of the Čang Č-čung Centre told the New China agency that the pand breeding is at risk of a relative crossing.
In captivity, only 471 pands lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wilderness.
The attempt to clarify the captured pandes with these wild ones is such a first step in helping to protect the pand breeding.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released in the natural reservation at the beginning of the pandi burning period on March 11th.
Thanks to the neck tracking device, scientists could watch every step of it.
She met her chosen Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male panda took a minute and a half and succeeded.
Even this can be considered a little miracle because male rulers are not considered the most successful lover of an animal empire.
The males misrepresent the time when females are ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The youth was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed after birth of 216 grams.
The average weight of the new panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulhars, was detained on August 1st, in the morning hours of the sitgoni police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and imposed strict fines to anyone who is caught on a site where the camping is not permitted.
Checks will be on the whole season.
The Ministry said that the court could place a fine.

Twenty-year-old Czech player has the hope that he's going through a cut on the famous major for the first time.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands withdraw millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultrymeat in the event of an incident.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority of the NVWA, according to Reuters, announced that it investigates 20 percent of all Dutch poultrymeat, which according to it means that 80 percent of eggs on the market are irrelevant.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs identified according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not present any danger to adults, but the potential threat is to children.
Speaker of Czech SVS Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined the closure of breeding, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, the veterinarians will take samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which insecticide problem marks appeared on the markets.
According to the Veterinary Administration on the Czech market, the eggs from Belgium were last in April and last in May.
The chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparent to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feeling nausea and dizziness.
Riga's beautiful, I'm gonna miss him, he's calling goaltender Sedláček and looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there once," said the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the winter jersey.
Depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it as a school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much for the first year. I had an experienced goalman in front of me.
I've been studying.
I started catching the second year.
Third season ago, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new goalman with whom I was turning again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the initial ten matches, we got only five points, so the conemen started to spin.
At the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historical city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together the third year, next year we're getting married.
So I brought something.
How challenging is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or the Slavan who must change their game style against them.
The guilty is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more in the back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the playground.
The difference is the Russians want to play empty.
Less fires, and even though they have a half-empty gate, they'd rather record.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with travelling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
She can sleep calmly.
The program is usually done by playing four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do the Lotis feel their club at KHL?
As a national team.
All Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball, it's a national sport.
Everybody's fans.
Even though it wasn't good, a lot of people were walking.
Did Dinama in KHL help to make Latvia at this year's world championship almost gone to quarterfinal?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And since the same time, their results began to go up to the world's championship.
On the Olympics of 2014 in Socha fell in the quarterfinal with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
Still more Latvian players are heading to Czech extraligia.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zlin and Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
How come so many people come here?
They're no bull players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Lotes are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Riza.
Then we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalman budget, we didn't have a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but they decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm practicing at home in Zlin and waiting for something to appear.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left and didn't know what was going to be.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I'm home after some time.
I caught something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question is when and where I sign.
How real is the option that you're going to take a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what's going to come up.
Now I can just wait for the agent to finish.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't the way I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
Government flight continues at Let.
In January this year, I wrote about the camp in the Letys near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to remind myself of the article's serious passages.
We've been talking about the camp in Lety for many years.
For readers who don't exactly know what's going on, it's probably best to look at, for example, the official pages of the Cultural Memorial Pieté Place of Fly.
In the introduction of the historical overview, they will find that the camp was two kilometres east of the village of Leta, that since 8.8.1940 he served as a work camp, since 1st 1st, 1942 he was a collecting camp and from 2.8.1942 he became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported to the extinction camp.
A total of 420.
A very sad history of an incredible affliction of human beings that have caused them human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be recalled constantly.
There is no dispute nor that the remembrance should be held at the monument in the place of experience of these people’s suffering.
The problem is elsewhere.
For socialism, the camp was a little overlooked, and in the 1970s, he was close and built in the part of the former camp.
Historic camp discovered randomly in 1992 the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was discovered in Lety.
In the mid-90s of the 20th century, the government promised to redemption and destruction of the pig, but it has not yet happened.
In 1998, the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration under the Peoplece Memorial has fallen.
In July 2013, the UN Committee on Human Rights of the Czech Republic called on it to close the dump.
So many brief facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last autumn, the government approved the redemption of the pig and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, then the government will buy the pine.
According to Herman's culture, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably dream of the intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some of the unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions can be made, according to others, the price can reach billions.
Either way, it won't be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp is a memorial in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction had been funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which seems to be in no danger, it would be the same to me to throw away money.
Does the government have no other priorities?
A memorial, a dignified peculiar place, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the ongoing tragedy and anyone who wants, can be compassionate here by monuments suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's just leave it as it is, and keep the peculiar place with maximum care.
A person responsible, in this case, the government of the Czech Republic, should deal with the care of a proper economic operator.
At least with the kind in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
But I can still see, from the point of view, the password leader of the movement is only as empty pre-election clarification.
In May this year, I went to see the place.
A very decent drive, adjusted parking lot, replicas of wooden camp bars.
In one exposure, in the second integrated WC with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and looking at its own pedestrian place, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and curtains.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as well as they belong.
Currently, it takes place at the place of original archaeological research.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the found found found foundations could not be preserved and, in an appropriate manner, at least visually accessible.
This way, he could set up his efforts by the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman.
In case he manages to sell the government the purchase of the pig for the state money, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already enough difficult action in the function of the Minister of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may mitigate the symptoms of inflammatory intestines (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and milk products may be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal proteins and milk products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
The unhealthy disease that affects up to 1.3 million people of the US and 300,000 patients in Great Britain causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to mitigate symptoms. However, the University of Washington has found that the essential triptophan amino acid in protein helps to create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna's head of study explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protects the body without harming sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bowls bolt to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In research, scientists discovered the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of the mouse with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of triptophan cells - one of the protein blocks.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of intestinal microbiome and cell development that promotes body tolerance.
The more triptophans had the mouse in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, it suggests that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and diet rich in triptophan would help develop more tolerant and less inflammatory intestines.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance revealed that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mouse kept cells separately lacked.
It was based on the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - the community of bacteria, viruses and molds, which typically reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse jaw was tested by the method of assembling DNA and researchers found six kinds of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked the second group of mouse.
Myths that were preserved in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiome - did not evolve this type of immune cells - were given by L. reuteri bacteria - and created immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affects the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without a bacteria - undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved in a tolerant cell.
Following the removal of the active ingredient from the fluid, it was shown that it was an by-product of triptophanic metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophan in mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After distributing the doses of triptophane decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mouse and most of us keep the L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the L. reuteri by-products of the triptophan bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but the defects in triptophan-related genes have been detected in humans with inflammmatory intestines.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control inflammation of the intestinal surface.
Potential high levels of triptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria can increase cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signature of the contract with Nemanje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United won in his team “génia” in the form of Nemanja Matiće - at least he thinks it was José Mourin's idea after he debuted in the Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the contract for £40 million, was held in the first match by 2:1 in Dublin - the last preseasonal game before the EUFA Superwave, where the United meets with Real Madrid - and he played his role as a backup agent at the side of Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team's presesonal Asian tour, Matić did not have a form and played only 45 minutes on what Mourinha said to work before the beginning of the next season of the Premier League.
"It needs time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has brilliant thinking - thinks soccer," said Mourin.
"We'll help him get into the condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new associates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukak also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourin's slowly forming his eleven for the next season.
Independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists that the club did “fantastic work” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"The four of the four would make me more pleased, but I admit they did the best for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins of Ládi Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multilayer image began to be rituated thanks to the new show on TV Prima Zdeňkova Academy.
The mushroom just gave us a chance.
"Dear Zdenik, I'd like to sign this into your academy cooking because I think I can learn a lot from you," he invited him to the social network in the video.
And since these two have been high for years, he hasn't forgotten to irritate him even this time.
"In return, I can teach you a dietary chicken meat, American cucumbers, or invite you to the water, and show you why he's popular with fried cheese," he ripped the Pepper.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said," said Lightning.
However, he did not express himself because he recorded the new parts of his next show Yes, chef!.
Only Prima responded to the participation of the Culinary Academy, taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes off television.
Hruška Pohlreich took a great shot in December 2004 by his first cook.
She's been sold over 300 grand in a few days!
The new show, which was introduced by Prima last night at the press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is the unfaithful cooking school.
He is taking his pupils out of the range of viewers, and in the 12 parts he will meet with 12 cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show now Chef cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt on his back torched pear.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"Onto the pear, I'm just smiling - pear is healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," he responded to Láďa.
Honey's culinary art thinks hers.
"The cooking according to Lada Hruška doesn't even come home because I don't get a gastropunk at home," the boss is clear.
I appreciate Zdeňka Pohlreicha very much, even according to him I'm making chicken on honey.
But in my show, his recipes definitely don't appear," he didn't forgive the Pepper.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analfabet or moron," said Pohlreich on one lecturer.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't even deal with them anymore," said Hruška's accusations on the account.
The British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by mawing
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip put into the body. With a simple machining hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
The three-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between the thumb and the insighter and currently offers the same service through its company BioTeq companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an aesthesiologist of the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, is supervised by the implantation and maintenance of treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to exchange door locks and cars compatible with microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
A child's married father had technology integrated into his house and his car BMW Z4, which will start with a simple hand mawing.
White House Requisition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to fly with a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to the occasion of the celebration of the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came according to the Navy records that issued the weekly TIME, to $24,000.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the top of the program from July 17th in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and some of the high officials of the White House have overlooked a show of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exposed next to the Maine yacht, the fire truck from Wisconsin and the Wisconsin vidlicovite lifting wheelchair from Mississippi.
The Military Officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested a helicopter not less than 36 hours before landing a helicopter on the South Lawn under the “misleading” event, reported the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such an important event," wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to your superior, Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation Day before the start of the event.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at about 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the entire place was fully cleared, planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail it continued to say that if there was a delay on the departure from the White House, a replacement crew for return flight will be sent in due to the working time regulation.
The original crew remained on the scene that night along with the helicopter and with them also a security team.
From the records - which TIME received - it was not apparent if the second crew was finally sent.
Hatch Act prevents public officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," said the representative of the commander.
This show "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event, and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President promoted the health reform that went through the Chambers and talked about trying to maintain the government's regulation.
The use of air carriers such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them for travel.
However, their presence is uncommon because of presentations.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane traveled in the background at his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is absorbed by complaints about the use of his predecessor of the President's aircraft.
“The White House is pleased with the show of “Made in America”, which presented products from all 50 states that Americans produce from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters' press secretary.
HMX-1 helicopter crews are often trained by landing in Washington and South Lawn and training possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the show Made in America was part of the current training of the crew, said a state official.
The helicopter unit flew the same day within the “neprezident support missions” of the next eleven hours.
The White House stated that no further requisition was paid from the taxpayers' money.
Speaker Sikorsky said that the company was not in any way interested in the negotiations on the exhibition of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for the presidential years and the precise costs in relation to the show are difficult to determine by the navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of the costs of the DoD for VH-3D 24 380 $ per summer hour.
Unit records indicate time 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly below that amount.
“The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement is very misleading,” Walters said.
‘This estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, the costs of the DoD do not include staff costs but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Earlier printing secretary of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the show.
"The idea of a show that takes place this week is to introduce products produced in the USA," said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut State are very proud of the fact that they contribute to defending our state, and that they provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and the other military equipment in which a countless American citizens are involved.
This fact should be reminded."
It is unclear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter at his South Lawn round, with certainty it can only be said that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know very well Skorsky," said the president, "I own three."
A young woman trapped in a swamp at Mach's lake, police bearded her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about 2:00 in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the urinary.
When she decided to ask her mobile phone to help the policeman, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," said the police spokesman Ivan Balák.
There were several police patrols on the place she described, but finding a young woman wasn't easy at all.
"One police officers had to wipe with the raccoon wets of hundreds of meters before they felt under their feet again solid ground," Báláková approached.
Likewise, she was missing.
The police were oriented according to which direction her call for help was based.
"For at least they didn't lose this connection, they talked to her that he would count out loud," said the speaker.
The police found a woman in the swamps in Borný's area at three quarters to five.
She was on the edge of physical and mental forces and showed signs of irritation.
That's why the ambulance called took her to a Czech hospital.
The Grandfather's connection with the STAN?
The requested bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
It's like a billionaire to voters basically said that the STAN suffers from a decent people's deficit.
And he also claimed that a group of less known mayors and independent politically does not have a national programme for the House elections.
Her voter's candidate just becomes a decent person, no matter what political opinion, after having an interview with Grandfather.
This was the way Wint Bart started, and it didn't work very well.
By chasing decent people and personalities, which, if appropriate, replaces some mayors, which also admitted Gazeca, the grandfather also abolishes the popular argument of Chief STAN, that the greatest value of the movement is the political examination and experience of the mayor, traditionally the most popular politics, even according to the surveys.
Now, they're free to set up a quick-up gathered unsub personalities.
Total breakdown with humans, after which the STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdia explained even by not losing its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if the STAN suspected only a few of them then, after the grandfather came, the only game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long defined himself against ANO Andrei Babiš, but the Grandfather, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is to move ANO, the Starost movement is to gain 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mistake his movement.
Grandfather's a successful businessman, and I'm sure the billionaire isn't a chance.
They often talk about politics like Babish, unlike him, but they won't be their own political brand.
The STAN has for a while reminded of a reality show than a real political party, and the grandfather's helper's hand, as if she's even more of the requested bride's being a sales girl.
For a while, the STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone gets back to you.
Police dogs trained in the bridge by helicopter
Dogs specialized in searching for explosives and search dogs today trained at Lake Most by helicopter.
The police dog must not be fearful and fearful of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústecké region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At the bridge, they trained both adult dog training, and those who were just undergoing training.
In addition to the standard training, where they were to reveal sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So as soon as he's given helicopter, he could go work the dog so he wouldn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"The helicopter, the dog is coming and looking immediately," said Tomášek.
The dog, who is restless or helicopter on his way, is unable to start working immediately, is out of training.
"Therefore, the dogs, for example, keep them in the garden," added Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Ústecké region.
The German sheep are dominated, but also the belgical sheep.
The dog cares for him from the puppy.
"He's raising it himself, preparing it for a service that the dog will do for us," added Tomášek.
Animals are undergoing repeated veterinarian examinations that may reveal any health hendicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he shall submit his first test in 20 months.
"To a sharp intervention, he gets around two and a half to three years," he added Tomášek.
The length of the police service depends on the condition of the dog.
He usually serves in eight to ten years.
They live mostly at their dogwaters.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of the company, including women, have been reported at the heart of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that elections to local representatives attend hundreds of women, three women are missing the post of Vice-President and over 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” said in his medieval statement.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only if women are involved as well as all the processes relating to the choices.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on April 5th.
The Taliban has published several threats against the election process that moves international battle activities to the second round.
In this year's elections, one democratically elected government is giving his power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The independent election committee of Afghanistan stated that a total of 3.6 million registered voters constitutes 1.2 million women.
Unique brewery's cooking beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a brewery in Lobch near Mash.
The beer reminded for the first time in 1586 has a renaissance core, and in the 19th century it was converted into a parometer operation.
She followed the bloom for years when the brewery was famous mainly with dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was born.
Since then, they've served the buildings of a state ship.
The work of destruction was accomplished by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and distributed to construction material.
In 2007, however, new hopes were made in the form of new owners, architects of Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They started repairing buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to studying archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The beer has the same form as in the 19th century when his golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by a statement of the brewery for cultural monuments by the Ministry of Culture and, moreover, the construction became part of the European path of industrial heritage.
In 2015, the traditions of cooking beer were renewed solemnly.
To taste the great lobster beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the hatch in the brewery area.
In cooking beer here, they use cocorinc water that is sourced in a protected landscape, sweet from the lamb fields and pupils.
In the garbage you will taste a traditional light lie, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, take place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half a.m.
The biggest artillery creator of Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest fortress of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique construction was the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacler, at the top of the terrain cemetery above the village of Babí.
It was supposed to be made up to 12 bunkers connected to a large underground.
This was supposed to be the headquarters, cassing, ammunition stores, materials, power plant, engineering and hospitals.
But the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, the only massive iron bunker was built and the underground spaces were destroyed.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from Stachelberg, who began to reconstruct at the beginning of the 1990s, you can also look here.
Underground is already 75 percent available!
Part of the area is the T-S 73 infantry screw with the exposure and underground and the armed object of light fortress, and two of the furnaces, hills and the teaching paths of the Flowed Trutnovsko.
refreshments, cozy altancs and glorious views of the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech construction came to the list next to the monuments such as the Great Wall of China, the Traian port near Rome or the Assyria Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
Monastery Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which is now primarily a powerful four-wing convent building over a beautiful garden.
The list that he got on, but unfortunately it belongs to unique buildings that threaten the outbreak.
But the survivors do not want to give up, and they have a lot of actions to support the monastery.
One of them is another year of the evening for the Monastery Chotěšov this Saturday of the fifth August, where M. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see the Swedish performance and look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually unavailable.
But most importantly, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

How does Moraviansia taste?
The seventh year of known gastrofessite how Moravskoslezsko smashing takes place on Saturday August 5, 2017 in the Karlova Studánka Mountain Spa area.
Cooking will be chef Miroslav Kalina, tasting culinary specialities and regional foods, enjoying music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, smurf competition trips and, of course, many competitions.
Know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the formation of herbs and common lovers of plants.
If they're interested in what plant they just ran into a walk, these applications will advise them.
The only thing they have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new application available for iOS and Android was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of CEEV Ethical and Environmental Education Centre in the Bratislava Mountain Park within the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret Life of the City site.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make as many people contribute to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
"The children who can hold the tablet or cell phone in their hand can go into the woods," said the coordinator of this project Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a sufficiently quality photograph of the flower, leave or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name, which will then be assigned under the photograph in Czech as well as in Slovenian.
The French have allowed us to translate the app into the Polish and Czech.
It is therefore welcomed that users, after the establishment of the account, contribute to the image of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"Francouzi will evaluate if it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," she informed Poláčková.
GMB concerns about the investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The departments require assurance from managers of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer on the long-term commitment of production in the factory in Glasgow.
The Scotland trade union of GMB stated that for the time being, the company is silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
There are more than 500 employees working in the factory who produce other products and cookies from Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that she invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area in the past few years.
She added that the staff and representatives of the union will be ‘the first informed borders’ in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In the letter of the construction company, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concerns that McVitie's “does not get his promises about financing and modernisation of production lines.”
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the builder regarding the needs of society and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There were generations of many families and employees mainly from the local community and area of Glasgow, where work in the factory here represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, salaries and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, increasing life costs and dropping slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer such as McVitie's."
The spokesperson of Pladis said: “Student Tollcrosss received a letter from GMB only yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and representatives of unions.
Regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and this meeting was openly discussed many problems.
We spoke with employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in Tollcross, especially in production lines and efficient operation.
We very much appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality here, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory here, employees and representatives of unions will be immediately informed."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neyar's movement three years ago?
La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in his efforts to get Neymara on its side after she made £189, i.e. the amount needed to redeem Neymara from the contract, but has this French team of Barcelona warned about its record raid three years ago?
The Ligue 1 Club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the passage of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid $89 million for it in the last season.
After confirming and finishing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after taxation will be from the PSG team to collect over £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is argued by the way Neymar came out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to accept Neymar since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world pointed to this fact three years ago by President of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
"I am not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly address one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the thoughtline when she expressed interest in PSG Marc Verratti in summer.
The PSG clearly expressed that, under no circumstances, they would not allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona, for its deliberately dealings with the departure of Neymar, is now swallowing a bitter pill.
Who explains the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump was a noodle to anti-rurusan sanctions.
A day before that, the US sanctioned the Venezuelan President Madura.
And one day before Trump wrote that China does nothing to a North Korean threat and that it won't go on.
Even the idea of sanctions as a shoe shoe straw.
These things can't be thrown in one bag.
Madeur's Venezuel really went on the way to dictatorship, and to totality.
China doesn't just act as the American president would wish.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to summarize all of this so that a common voter, American, European or other, to understand what it is and what system of rules is based on sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only attracts what President Obama has already set up, he just gave it an Implementation stamp.
Then why such a distraction?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if the American Trump elections were to win, let's hug Putin and revoke sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, the sanctions are not released, but tightening.
But Europe scares even more.
The German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Is that the basket is just sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
But then they are not cosmetics or EU anti-Romans sanctions.
The President of the European Commission Juncker complains again that Trump's sanctions are jeopardising EU energy security.
Like they're supposed to use sanctions as weak as they're not gonna threaten anyone?
It's a common dial caller.
Three years he heard that the fate of anti-Romanial sanctions depended only on the implementation of the mining settlement agreements in Ukraine.
It is now found that this is about EU energy security.
The volcano is spreading even more.
There are sanctions in Russia for getting too mounted where it doesn't have.
China is skinned for mounting a little.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just thoughts have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, order or rules in it?
Andrej Babiš: I don't think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are finished.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian hejtman and the shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a captain," he confirmed his former opinion by Babish.
Many representatives and national politicians have upset your theory that the Mayors and primates should direct the villages and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I'm a favourer of direct democracy, we vote directly to the President, and I believe that we should vote mayors and primators anyway.
In my book, I'm not talking about interfering with representatives, they can be there.
The question is, how many are there.
When I was presenting your book what I dream about, by chance, when I sleep, I heard on my own, that you were talking about the cancellation of the deputy.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five divisions and 51 deputys.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the prime minister is reading that it's not enough to build and prepare large projects, but she doesn't have the power to do it.
The same applies to the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman were driving in our history.
Which I'm not saying they did it right.
The current Prime Minister's not running anything, but he's just modering the debate.
That can't work.
Is that why you're going to sell the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to sit down.
There's only a change in the program for one-wheel choices to the Senate.
We have also proposed a joint mandate of ministers and a regulation of the Rules of Procedure of the House to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members working mainly in committees and committees, not to be presented at the meetings of the House.
It's definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as dictator you will manage the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the countries and the Senate, and through the grateful mayors and prime ministers, the entire country.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There's nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron reported a reduction in the lawful congregation of a third, while there is 57,000 French legislator on one, while it is based on 17,000 Czechs.
However, no one blames Macron for threatening democracy.
Even if someone had won the elections most in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
Conducts for those who have a parliamentary majority, however, are great, just look in Poland or Hungary.
There's nothing like that in the case of an ANO movement.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for our crews or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only teachers, employees in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they vote me over and add 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you finish like a Prime Minister for that?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when the ministers are acting unsustainably, mistaken by the government with the travel agencies and would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and the soil in Africa.
Ministers don't have to argue in the government, they're supposed to talk outside of it.
The cabinet must go to the finished material, there is no place for coalition breaks, strong votes and deals, there is a decision to be made.
How do you want a coherent team when the Ministers act mainly partly?
There's a constitutional law above the sides.
When it came to breaking bread, Saturday said that the coalition did not apply, and he fired Babish from the government.
Every Prime Minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has control skills, the same false gesture does not need.
They measure everyone the same, and they all require perfect performance.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because I don't think we're going to be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so bad.
There's not that much sketch in place.
The mayors have gained an entrepreneur Grandfather who would like to work with you, with humans, he may win the wing of your leaned Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the coalition with the ANO, may be planted in ODS by Václav Klaus ml.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with the SPD Tomia Okamury, for example in the area of the economy.
So the occults take into account as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, running as a doll of Víta Bárty for the VV, then gaining money for his company from the dawn, there was a rifle.
Of course, he's a significant personality.
Of course, somewhat naked.
When I take his program, there's a wide range of people involved in society management, direct democracy, that's what you can agree.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a acceptable person who has xenophobia opinions, speaks at demonstrations with enchantries and wants to come out of the EU?
We don't think about working on Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Obviously he went into politics to benefit from it.
And what about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating the winner with the other in order, but God knows who the winner and who's going to be the winner.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on the coalition government program.
Let's get back to your efforts to drive the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Saturday let everything be avoided, never decided.
Coalitional matters like ČEB or EGAP did not work.
Because Saturday's his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, ČEZ had control of the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which he holds on to the Minister of Finance, how to vote at the General Meeting of ČEZ.
If you'd become a Prime Minister, would you turn personal terms into the Supervisory Board and replace ČEZ's top management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a Prime Minister, I'll see you.
I'm not that guy yet.
CEZ's been sending signals to your direction.
Good cooperation with the CSSD would like to trade for even better with ANO.
Well, maybe after the election, everything's going on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Lobbist of Pokorné or Rose, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not dealing with it at all.
So answer directly.
If you are in charge of the government, will you seek to exchange ČEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, i.e. the institutions that you criticize?
I'd like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, you've been doing what he wanted for years, and thanks to the commission for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to stand in ČEZ majority, he's never driven him, he's only in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial thing to me.
ČEZ should take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a coinvestor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows run a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have, and I won't have any power to fire anyone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public radio and television fees about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't actually know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs of the Czech Republic.
Look how these reports are discussing, the super power Pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
It pays both about the current parliamentary committee to escape from the investigation records and lex Babiš.
And Saturday was so stupid that Kalousek got pushed to kick me out of the government, which scored the percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them.
They're afraid of disturbing their corruption system, so they're talking about the threat of democracy by Babish.
No one's immune.
What do you say by the articles describing how the first Vice-President ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a powerful background by putting his son into the Tepláren Brno Supervisory Board and establishing a related lawyer to Květoslav Hlín's contracts with urban and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railway?
That's a lasting dispute.
I don't like it, and I've been bothering him a few times.
Faltenic argues that the mentioned lawyer works for substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvíl, March.
If there was any indication of clientelism, we fired this person immediately.
In this respect, I am uncomfortable.
If something like this happened, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it would be.
