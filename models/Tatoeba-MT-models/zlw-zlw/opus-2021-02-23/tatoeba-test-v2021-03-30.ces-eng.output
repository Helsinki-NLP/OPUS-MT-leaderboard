Are you still here?
I thought you might be dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and right, then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.

Tom's gonna be 13.
Cut the meat on thin slices.
I can't watch them ruin their lives.
Do everything with balance.
I'm buying only soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed up to the top of the Fuji Mountain.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember how she was?
The belt's too tight.
It's not easy to play shit.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer in our place.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The ancient habits are dying quickly today.
Tom's still busy.
You better leave now.
Tom's childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.

The train had to stop because on the tracks the tree was falling.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the 17th century.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?

Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.

Are you going to school by train?
Tom won't be at school tonight.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom gonna visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me to a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me if it happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his legs carefully.
Did you eat this morning?

I'm perfectly happy alone.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played Mary tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
They've been standing here halfway through the walls.
I spoke to him English and found out I could make a deal.

She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.

I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see it better.

Could the message be true?
It's easy to get, it's easy to get rid of.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
