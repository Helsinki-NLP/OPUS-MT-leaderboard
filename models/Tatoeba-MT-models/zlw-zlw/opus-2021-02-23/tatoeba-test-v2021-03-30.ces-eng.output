Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you might be dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and right, then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 13.
Cut the meat on thin slices.
I can't watch them ruin their lives.
Do everything with balance.
I'm buying only soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed up to the top of the Fuji Mountain.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember how she was?
The belt's too tight.
It's not easy to play shit.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer in our place.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The ancient habits are dying quickly today.
Tom's still busy.
You better leave now.
Tom's childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because on the tracks the tree was falling.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the 17th century.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He climbed a tree with great effort.
The translation of Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood too.
We know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you pointed me out.
I missed breakfast.

It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager for noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
They're dropping.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like the tie.
We didn't do as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.

I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom had a glitter.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom won't be at school tonight.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom gonna visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me to a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me if it happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his legs carefully.
Did you eat this morning?
Jana was happy as a flea when she got a recording contract.
I wish you were with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this stunt if you were to help us.

They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.

If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy alone.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played Mary tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
They've been standing here halfway through the walls.
I spoke to him English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom must have run.
I see the book.
When did any of you talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You got fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.

Their father is Bohemia and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced.
I bought a bag.

Did you do it on purpose?
There were absolutely no doubts.
I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own.
Once we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laughter seizure.
Tom's wrong, right?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.

I borrowed that comb.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.

I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
It used to be bigger.
I assume he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait for him to come back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.

I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.

Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father's running a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like German movies.
This works.
Leave the hooch.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Could the message be true?
It's easy to get, it's easy to get rid of.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If I hadn't helped her, I'd never have made that test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
