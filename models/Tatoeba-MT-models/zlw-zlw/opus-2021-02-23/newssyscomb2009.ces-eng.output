The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together are 29 percent
The apparent weakening of both sides of the current large coalition and significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties brought, according to the first preliminary results, the Sunday premature parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered strong losses, where the position of the present President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shattered.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the corrotian hejtman Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the social democracy country (SPÖ) remains with 29,8 percent of the votes, but loses 5,5 percent against the 2006 final elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, losing with 25.6 percent of almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both these great parties in the Austrian postwar history, and especially for humans who have caused premature elections, literally a catastrophic outcome.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP came out of coalition, people had a significant lead in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for letting the government lose.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and the Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Bureau of the Party.
Such development would seem to facilitate the way to the most likely exit from the election result, i.e. to restore the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-hand populist parties - free (FPÖ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - but the social Democrats also expressed concerns about the recurrence of 1999 when the people agreed to the populists (now the FPÖ had yet been united, in 2005 BZÖštěd) on the common government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
Haider's betting is clearly on this development, which has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes return to Vienna to national policy.
The Group of the Greens has yet reached the Parliament, which has easily lost and has fallen between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly did not cross the four percent line and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegal collection of bugs could not be resolved, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karl Schwarzenberg would have made some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister put it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Lanab Mukherjim.
"If it hadn't resolved, then yes, then some cooling would have happened," said after the meeting, which took place from the Czech initiative.
Mucherji said that the executive may be very difficult to intervene in court matters.
However, he claimed that, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed and punished by a fine, the central government may act with the local government in Dardżying, to which the jurisdiction falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kucher sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherd would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
Then he may ask for bail and wait for the sentence on freedom, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also expressed himself as his partner during the meeting.
"It recommends appeals to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech Party may enter the whole matter is to provide convicted 'competent legal support', said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian Party has already provided such assistance to them.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a deep mistake of imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists," said.
Answering whether he received a promise from the Indian party to deal with things, the Minister avoided.
"I've had quite a lot of promises," he said only.
What judges the fight for the seabed
They will join a wall electronic map on which Australia is illustrated and adjacent sea area.
However, he does not care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of UN personnel of the Oceans and Maritime Law Division.
His boss, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches and sometimes complete.
He rules the work elana and enthusiasm.
The sea bottom hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, ores and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing cancer.
Day greater than the mainland
The coastal states today began to go deeply for a new submarine territory.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental goat, which often reaches a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country concerned.
According to the Convention, it is solely entitled to all sources of continental shoe.
"Simply taken, behind the continental shoe has the part of the seabed and its foundation, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It reaches beyond the coastal sea borders, often beyond the border of two hundred nautical miles called exclusive economic zones", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has already discussed five requests, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last mentioned countries have succeeded so far," says Mike.
The world’s announcement has recently recorded the success of Australia, which, as the first, has substantially extended its submarine holdings.
But he also won New Zealand - the seabed area that the Commission admitted to him last week is about 1.6 million square miles, i.e. about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will fall to them in the future from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, uncensible.
Other States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do that until ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shoe ends, the ocean bottom area begins, the Convention declared "common heritage of mankind".
There is no State no more exclusive position here.
The law of mining in this area shall be granted by a Convention established by an international institution.
"But there is no Klondajk of the sea," says the director Mikulka in excess of saying that his "single areas are legally clearly defined and their contractual regimes are established".
Czeches in Pacific
Today, the Czech Republic is part of the seabed.
They are involved with other countries of the Eastern Block in the "Interoceanmetal" Joint Organisation.
It gained in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors of several other states, the status of the so-called "prior tour investor".
It is authorised to benefit in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The investor of the explored area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The day is a member, it's kind of a Tater submarine replica.
"It can be used on the area with a total area of 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetalic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian Rober Sandev division worker brings such a concretion to a demonstration.
Reminds a small potato or, in a little fantasy, a legendary sham that resurrected the Golden.
The German special deployment units were in the release of hostages
The Egyptian government has requested help from Germany in dealing with the crisis with hostages - experts have arrived.
When the situation erupted, special units were prepared, but there was no place to be deployed.
The public is gradually given further details of the circumstances of the exemption of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the internal, the German Special Forces participated in the rescue action.
According to the Minister's comments, both the experts of the Federal Army were freed, and the members of the German Police Anti-Terrorist Group, the Flights of the Federal Police, the Federal Crime Office, as well as the logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to the further communication of both ministers from Monday afternoon, no German forces were needed because the captives had let their captives go and escaped when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
According to Germany, the Egyptian government adopted the aid offered as support forces for action on the spot.
"Fortunately there was no such thing," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers abducted a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romania, and eight of their Egyptian guides on the south of Egypt.
After abduction in the desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the exemption or possible redemption of the ransom.
At present, the salvation is all right in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostage is located in the care of the German Embassy.
He didn't express himself to the details of the release.
There are no information yet available in Berlin when the rescue returns to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild" of all five tourists, one of the airbuses of the German air force and Germany should arrive on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress had a hard majority fallen a rescue package for the financial markets worth $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index has fallen strongly.
Between 206 and 227 votes, the US House rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of the American President George W. Bush and the front policy of both sides, the programme that should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets has not been found by most.
Dramatic events with the supporters desperately tried to convince them about a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote of the MEP for consent, even though, as he expressed, the plan is not popular.
"It is hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reasons were the concerns of investors that the State Rescue Package could fall apart.
Shortly before the vote, the value of the index was raised to fall shortly after the notification of the collapse of the package.
Experts now count on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to agree to the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record growing reservations
It looks like the winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, more than 30 percent of the winter season increased in booking tours for next months compared to the previous year.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of Germans to travel unfairly.
During the winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German travel union stated in Berlin on Monday (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV).
According to the survey of the GfK market survey institute, there are already increased booking rates for autumn months.
The turnover was thus, according to the statement of the DRV for October compared to 2007 by around eleven percent.
The GfK numbers are based on these results, which evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them on the overall market.
This result was included in the reservation of tours held by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar course, the paths to the United States are particularly requested, said the DRV.
On these roads, the reservation increase is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly demanded targets for Germans as well as domestic waters.
Firstly, the organized tours are in the course, declared the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food expenditure, there are costs "for the client to be easier than for individually organized holidays".
Laepple explained that the money may, inter alia, save consumers by using a discount for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year will be again recorded a higher turnover - even though according to another study the Germans who took a journey dropped compared to the previous year.
My First Oktoberfest
Completely repeated ash, a beer of tuples and prominents in rounds from known designers.
For the first time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator, and she wears a shaved slice.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes left to beer meadows, and photographers are already throwing on us, and they're messing with memory cards - that's flattering me, because I'm on Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap slice has accomplished its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I'm living north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort was rather limited in the rotation.
But right after you arrived in Theresienwies, everything's better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears women's cuts or leather pants; no one looks disgusting or embarrassingly affected - everything is completely normal.
The special views at the banana stand in chocolate just eat my apron.
One Munich reminds me that I tied her wrongly: "You're left free, in the middle of a virgin, right-hand, widowed in the back."
I'm going to sweat my butter from the back of the left.
"Okay," he says and laughs.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much and they're wearing simple plunged hats with the title "The drunk to get dressed!" and they're sticking out on the passing naked ass.
The young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is Bob, he's from England, and he's come to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks like a "gorgeous," with an extended "Yes."
That's what he tells me after you've just made yourself feel better about a drunken maz.
Right next to one of the hydrants they all think they're trash.
Bob is one of the "Wildbieslers" feared in Bavaria, as it is called publicly free urinate people.
The others don't have the luck getting rid of alcohol like that.
Around the eighth evening they run around the area where Oktoberfest is held, a stubbornly medic who must take care of the poor drunkards.
Healthcares always appear in flocks - in four wear covered footwear from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors beer meadows: empty there, full of back.
You can't see who lies under the sail of this coffin.
"The ones that can't go on," will call me in response to my question by one of the medics and disappear in the crowd.
The police published the name of the victim of the accident
The name of the 30-year-old woman was published, who died in the hospital after the car hit her in Essex.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon, Carole Paulson hit the other Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died later.
After the accident, a 1,50-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of a carefree ride.
He's already been bailed.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to try to enter the European Union, Europe’s power was to penetrate deeply into the Turkish enclosure.
On the eastern shore of Bospor, maybe only 20 steps in Asia, is one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš Railway Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-renaissance sloh.
That's what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits circularly at the end of the platform with the tower on each corner of the front, to look at the unrecognition from some provincial German town hall.
Rock is dirty.
The whole construction is slowly falling apart.
But as soon as you get inside the caged treasures, you can no longer have doubts about the size of a business whose the most odd gate of the station was.
The station opened the German Consortium of Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, which joined the game of imperials late, intended to pursue its ambition to control the Middle East using this railway which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory which is today Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the first World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by frozen boundaries of cold war, is gone
The British and colonial forces proceeded from Egypt and forced Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And the Hydarpasha station also came the bad news.
In 1917, the ammunition train destroyed its working roof.
The Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually been drained and history has been circumcised.
However, today this gate to Anatolia and further to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The Government Party of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by frozen boundaries of cold war, is gone.
New policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian fractions of Hamás and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train into the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was supposed to meet one of the ACP leading experts on foreign politics, the Turkish Suate Kiniklioglu.
Next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a codecratic tour, which reminded the ancient world rhythms of the known document Night Post, I arrived into the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which would like to turn my back to its overseas past.
However, the ACP with its well-known Islamic roots represents the shift of the Turkish consensus paradigm.
She raised suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the ACP main tent, ultra-modern stone and metal building, intentionally built on an emerging suburb, surrounded by half-developed business houses and trade shops for power, where medium-sized managers in business outfits - men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-registered policy from almost every other European political party.
Sako, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest surroundings.
The cold war was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its enmity.
Today he has to watch the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But surely the moment will come," I said, "When might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "he didn't want to make such a decision."
Afterwards, he underlined what almost everyone I spoke to here said was almost in memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the surroundings of the Black Sea are equally to the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically, go east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpaš's station, after another widespread night, I was thinking of the two German lords of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, watching this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, from a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting for a ferry back in the port through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the powerless man of Europe".
So at least then there was no doubt that the continent should claim to this fascinating country.
Memorable Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a guildford music manager since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the periodic musical plan, the excellent Choir of Young Proteus set up a year for it.
He was supposed to be up to 21 years, but at the last time Proteus sang in 1979, it was almost 30 of us - we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape converter) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to play any music that was presented to him - whether madrigaly or Messiaen, whether alone or with the whole orchestra.
Musical adaptation created by such a young congregation was often astonishing, always exciting, and all because of the inspiration of the one man and enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchangeable all the time.
How often Tod just told us to "let the music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His tactical technique was completely clear and precise, but it wasn't even dictatorial, not even May.
No matter where the musical standard was, he's always invited him.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was supposed to be suited to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when Guildford Philharmonic was conducting from 1962 to 1982.
For the past 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed in any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "snatched the world one or two smashed hells."
We'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's note by the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed a dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it as a publication of the British rubber industry in 1958.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resin "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was struck by the simplicity and with a strong charge with which the viewers act, and with respect and respect for photographers.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda will attack his bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this one-space vehicle already has a significant space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
This includes improved engines that increase the comfort of driving and allow more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the new Jazz lines are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred in this one-space car.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Before we examine the new model, it must be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the first generation has been introduced.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to cool this model than other producers.
Although jazz is a less known model in Europe, in other markets it became a phenomenon in sales.
This is a case of Japan, a country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, as well as during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold to the market since Hondy Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million sold pieces in six years.
Honda is, however, aiming for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 pieces of Hondy Jazz, the estimates are estimated at 100,000 cars in 2009, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which means 6.7% of the total Honda sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch leader expects a sale of 2,000 pieces a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
Thus, the car management de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% from last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2 %.
In order for Honda to achieve this share, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact size with a length of 4,37 metres from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of around 200,000 pieces per year.
As far as markets are concerned, according to the estimates of the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States while the remaining percentage will divide the old continent and Japan.
Initiation of Hondy Insight sales is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is introduced to the public in January in Valencia.
Against the first generation, all dimensions have increased in the new Jazz.
Its length has increased to 3,9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1,69 meters (two centimeters more) and the axle solution to 2.5 meters, which means the extension by five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1,52 metres.
There was an increase in the size of the inner space.
However, this advantage was achieved by using the new platform, but by saving the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used for the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage area - which has a double bottom system - has increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage space for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the engine version 1.4, as the luggage area at Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement except the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the back seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle to open 80 degrees compared to 67 on the first Jazz model.
For the second generation, Honda Jazz is also new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will offer with two fuel engines 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and produces excellent improvements in the propulsion system with a high torque at a full range of engine speeds.
The first engine with a volume of 1.2 litres has 90 horses at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque 114 Nm at 4 900 speeds.
This engine - which had the Jazz 78 horses in the previous generation - has consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Against the previous engine, which was 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horse power has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"A car bee" prevents the collisions
To progress in the development of technologies protecting against accidents, Nissan has this time inspired in nature, specifically bee.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes for a bee flying pattern, so it prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. the robot developed in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in the Scientific and Technology Research Prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Mark Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four Nissan Security Shield zone.
The robot is responsible for strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in the cars of this brand.
During the flight each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to Nissana's safety shield.
However, the most important are the complex bee eyes that are able to see in all directions more than 300 degrees, allowing bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called a laser locateer (Laser Range Finder) when creating this visual function.
It records obstacles that are located within a distance of two meters in the range of 180 degrees before the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transfers it to a warning before the collision.
"When the obstacle is recorded, the robot will imitate the bee movements and immediately change direction by turning the wheels to the right or even bigger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference against any existing system is the fact that all moves are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobile Lab and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and directions to which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and options like bees.
Therefore, Nissan, besides acceleration and slowing down, also used the function of the rotation to prevent the robotics from collision.
"The establishment only needs to process the information every few seconds and be maintained according to these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about giga or mega in the memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies to prevent precipitation, a technology with which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead drivers to the goal and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take a mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the Ministry of Finance of the United States, except that it has sufficient capital for the distribution of injections, does not miss inventory.
Faced in the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages in a bank with doubtful solvency, it created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "The Hotel of Bad Loans"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel and especially his receptionist look cloudy to think about whether it is the right time to ask for credit once, twice and three times.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information even if not too detailed.
It's a website suitable for youth rather than a public space.
And what happens when the game is over?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley's banking house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that would deliver nine billion dollars to gain 21% of his capital.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of the common shares Morgan Stanley at a uniform price of $25, which represents a total amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of securities until 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars in obtaining convertible securities that will provide 10% of its return and whose exchange price is 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and got to $23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the banking holding," explained John Mack, the Director-General of the American Group.
The new statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which is to allow him to vary his activities, but it also puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest ace from Wall Street to take a much more careful approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan has only announced that he will sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought," explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "that our participation would consist exclusively of common shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to reduce risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's securities by 7% less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement presumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to the common shares for a year if the latter will be exchanged for a certain period of time by 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. for approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase his cash.
However, the speaker group refused to provide specifying information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of Tier One's payment eligibility ratio, i.e. one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, he reduced his balance.
The last weeks were difficult for the group, since its exchange rate fell by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of unpaid debt increased sharply.
These costs have been reversed on Monday, but they remained high, around 12%.
Last week she announced Goldman Sachs, the only other survivors from the big Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's ranch that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Rebuilt the Republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelce Huga Cháveze, Bolivice Eva Moralese and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed to vote, after the model of its counterparts and friends, proposed a new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished because 64% of the voters, according to the official results of 80% of the votes, voted "yes" in the referendum.
"No" according to these results obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the voters were empty.
To be accepted by the Constitution's proposal, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the exit from the election rooms and the countless non-governmental organization predicted a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, with 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his design of the Constitution last night from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution won all over the line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Moralese, but also from her Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the United States of America (OEA), took place in peace, covered the text of 444 points building the "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The Constitution proposal enlightens the power of the State over economics by replacing the "development planning" of countries living mainly from oil by foreign companies and from a foreign exchange that sends its emigrants.
The proposal by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the State heads that will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that this authority will be used and will be subject to a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the president began to introduce in the country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it is calculated by banning the presence of foreign armies, completing an agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the starting point of American drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad.
The Egyptian commando took 11 tourists and their eight-member escorts who were captured ten days ago by the attack of the kidnapper.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides who were held ten days in captivity in the desert were alive and well transferred to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, the Egyptian commando freed them in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, just adjacent to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without being able to comment on the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a border residence district of Cairo to be subject to medical examinations.
"They are completely well" and "the kidnappers have not been paid for any ransom," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohejr Garrana at the airport.
Since his captivity on September 19, during the safari in a vehicle with the drive of all four wheels on the foot of the Uanat mountain, at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was dragged from one hide to the other 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romania - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of Aegyptous, safari organizer.
One leader of the Egyptian security forces suggested that 30 members of special forces approaching the place on board two helicopters had gone to the station during the night just before dawn.
"There was a gunshot, half the kidnappers were killed, and the others fled," said the source he wanted to stay anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is, mentioned the role that secret agents and Italian special forces have played.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result because of professionality and efficiency of the people of our secret services, from special forces," said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
In the evening, the Sudanese army declared that on patrol, the vehicle was arrested by the driver of all four wheels on the board of the kidnappers, while six of them were killed, including the Chaadian commander, and two of them were arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Silent Most of the Department of Culture
The debate on cultural financing is a part of the newspaper's headlines and is a theme of the current pre-election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still opposed.
Who will rise to laundering poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memorable places that hunger?
Which politician would dare remind the federal government that they would forget their monuments and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restaurant of the Chinaon Castle in Loira Valley?
For our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that protecting the cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in synergies.
In Quebek, in the Quebek Federation of the Quebek history companies, at least 40,000 volunteers joined 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy about history spreading, keeping a bunch of private archives and protecting archaeological remains for a few minors.
Often these companies are the guarding dogs of our monuments, which are driven by hopeless protests when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally meet the tribunals for history and monuments?
Benelux Governments of the State Bank Fortis
The Benelux States will help the Belgian-Handland Bank Fortis, which, as the first in Europe, has been put into trouble due to the spreading crisis of the American mortgage market, a partial ageing: the three countries will support the cash and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend has agreed at the highest level of the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch government for the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the Eurozone, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, and the decision taken in this matter could be considered a precedent from a certain point of view.
In the sense of a decision born on Sunday night, all three states will purchase almost half (49 percent) of that property of the bank.
The Bank, with absolute certainty, will sell part of its capital participation, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch Bank ABN Amro.
Fortis' shares started to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious signs of the crisis in the Institute.
However, analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it disappear.
The company's securities only dropped by 12 percent on Friday, at the 14-year minimum.
Since January, the value of shares has declined by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's leaders, this is unrealistic.
The management of the company also blames for the fall of Fortis' stocks of uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US Package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the stocks have risen slightly.
On Friday, the new Director-General Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
A private buyer was also looking for the money institution, but no one has yet signed up with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors must not be afraid, they will not lose their money.
The bank's clients haven't paniced yet, and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
Fox in the hen
Life and health insurance companies in America on the basis of people's data on drug purchases often reject the possibility to conclude an insurance contract with a buyer.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"The data protection programme, which binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He's got to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we're confiding a liquor's jacket," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the program designed to monitor the prescribed drugs.
The insurance companies shall be insured and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events depending on the health status of the candidates and, if the risk is assessed as far as large, the insurance with it will not be closed.
Previously, they sent the doctors concerned and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the customer's identifiable number from the currencies easy to find out what the drugs concerned bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself produces the disease and the health condition.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol reduction medicines, it refers to virtually high levels of blood fat, which will immediately include it in a category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some also determine the risk coefficient, so there are almost no work left by the insurance companies except for paperwork, although there are minor problems.
The disadvantages include that leckter drugs can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraine or heat flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These represent an important risk-enhancing factor from commercial insurance perspectives, while not first-named difficulties.
For the purpose of requesting and processing the data, special companies have been created, which, before providing the necessary information from the pharmaceuticals, will ask the patient for permission.
This is what the authorities are already forced to do, even though they are not punished for their present negligence.
Some companies have recently processed the results of laboratory tests, which are associated with the data on the medicines used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
It has access to data to more companies, while checking their use will be increasingly complicated.
There is a special health protection law, but its effectiveness only applies to health care providers and insurance companies.
The proposal for a law that will provide authorities with the authority to control the data-species is before the Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his programme so that the transfer of data is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the permission in question can hardly deny, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are only somewhat cast on the fox's good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, it led this to the subject next to other, mainly global problems, also the agenda of the Ninth Summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit will also be held, which will be primarily about cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the United Nations Security Council.
This question was also not further discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, respected by the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with which they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or increases to more than 100 billion euros.
Since between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has increased from 25 to 55 billion, it is not an excess ambitious target.
In this case, 20,6 already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been harmonised from a legal point of view, so the green has also been transported in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is located between EU partners to the ninth place.
The summit was also paying attention to the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respecting terrorism, both parties condemned and called for a rapid convening of the UN conference in all its forms.
They also established the termination of the round of trade negotiations with Dauha, although they both have a great share in his current failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, as it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as that at the climate conference for the next year, global agreement and production of greenhouse gases would be needed to reduce by 50 percent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent the increase in food prices and support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today travels to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he intends to close a trade in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that the commissions for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion will receive French companies.
According to the Agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers participate in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International French Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 117.790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorable guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration festival in the Italian Palace: Italy will in fact participate in the institution with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 metres of square exhibition area.
It will follow the press at Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, tendencies and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign authors is still reduced in relation to total Italian production, especially due to the literature for children and adults.
Found a plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
He was found the rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying the desert in Nevada.
The Troses were discovered on one mountain plane at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sieř Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, exposed doubts that still remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we're sure this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The Sheriff therefore stated that there were no human remains found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the recognition of the trosek was sent out by the investigative team which eventually identified the plane: it is exactly Bellancu 8kcab, missing since 3rd September 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington to Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal objects were found near their homes in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, money in cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of pride.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man who completed the journey around the world in the air balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later, the world flew on a plane and without landing.
Among its many records are also flights at a height of 15.445 meters, above Andami, even with a copilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with exact corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born from the "composite" jeeps of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring news to this sector.
Thanks to his unconventional processing, it will be unexpected and non-conventional and communication that will accompany Suv Glk's placing on the market and which will be available in the showrooms Mercedes-Benz from next October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the new vehicle's debut, will launch an unofficial way of communication also thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin by presenting the car in a stereopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll have the impression that the car will leave the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative technology, Elumin8, the new Glk will be enlightened in various moments in all its little moments to reconstitute in one image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype area of autocommunications.
Can he wake up the interest of future customers in this way?
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who is the 150-200 boys and girls who are ashamed of Italy now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years, and which, in fact, has never, been having troubles.
She's never even met her opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right-wing.
Founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padov, Terst e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) of Campanie and Puglie joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin appear: they removed them on Saturday night so that they were not recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all on the name, i.e. easily controlled.
And Viminal really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the past Daslem, no one to be allowed to visit the stages.
The four blue fans who had earlier offences from the stadium were rejected and the game was banned.
Now Viminal is waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then will take measures: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riot.
International Daspo, which is forbidden to visit not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, shortly, won't go to one stadium any more.
For luck.
But now there is fear of emotion: that means that more than a hundred fifty are joined.
"We have to put out this fire right now and not justify those who act this way," confirms from Viminola.
So, "ready open eyes, especially for a national play in the middle of Lech."
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday, Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that carries out the problems in the stadiums.
"The Corps leaders and the arms pushed during Momel's anthems?
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very little happy way), which is a few weeks director of Viminál Osservatoria (a place that was earlier Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was a former Quaestor in Terst, where the core of Ultras Italia's supporters was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says that there is no crime to celebrate the leader in Bulgaria, but of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - delivers the Osservator One – crimes are attributed to the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now we will look at what has happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the hymn of Mummy: it's not a crime, but if you'll allow it, it's a ruthlessness."
