American Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The US Congress within 15 days of the adoption by the Department of State of the possible purchase by Poland 32 multinational F-35 hunters has not objected to this transaction, which means that the last condition has been met before the purchasing negotiations began.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approving the sale by the Department of State, and now by Congress, I do not see any more serious obstacles," John V. Venable, an older counselor for the Ombudsman's defence policy, conservative think of the Heritage Foundation tank.
The expert explained that, on the basis of the 1976 Arms Export Act, the Federal Government, represented by the Department of State, must notify the Congress of any planned weapons sale abroad 15 days before signing the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of weapons to the NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 hunters by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance costs, support equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finalised in the end - it will be the US arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is a manufacturer of engines for F-35A company Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of the F-35 F-35 US fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted by Mariusz Błaszczak in May.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year at the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalised, will be guarded by the Pentagon representatives under the Overseas Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired Patriot antiracotic system.
The price of one fighter F-35 at the time of Poland's purchasing offer was – without weapons and technical assistance – approximately 89.2 million dollars.
As PAP informed the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was “the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated”.
“The prices fall rapidly, now the price of one F-35 is less than 80 million dollars, much less than the Eurofighter, which does not have the advantage of F-35,” said Venable.
The PAP speakers expressed the hope that the final negotiations on the purchase by Poland of US combat aircraft will end this year.
The economic participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – i.e. offset – will be discussed directly with the US manufacturers of F-35 fighters.

It's not right, because parents can tell if their children are under bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of the Abdurrahman Police, who once visited the school to check the level of childcare, never had objections.
"He believed the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, a public relations police officer Yakubu Sabo believed that after giving the government the state of children would join their parents.
‘They have been treated in dehumanising conditions on behalf of subjecting or acquiring coronary knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves he's a bite.
That's why we're investigating school to meet her owner," he added.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I consider Donald Tusk and Margaret Kidaw-Blonska having a chance to win elections with President Andrzej Duda," says Tomasz Siemoniak.
Vice-President of the Citizen Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in a chat with Polsat News spoke of the affair with the head of the NIK.
“This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become a cultural minister from some kind of entertainment, not the head of the NIK or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who's responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also talked about the candidate of Klaudia Jachira.
“The letters of PiS are Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who didn't just say things, he was just doing it.
He judged the former SKW chiefs for spying on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone ask Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the letters?" he asked.
“The young people of us have another ethics.
I think that Jachira, who has already apologized for one of those things, also feels that she's overreacting sometimes.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

The Pope calls on executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the good of common
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financers that with the racing of the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of achievements in the digital field, there is a risk of increasing social inequalities if there is no common good in terms of ethics.
Pope Francis said these words during the Vatican conference, in which government emissaries and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics were involved.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
It was discussed technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work, which will play more and more role in machines, as well as a study of the case investigating bombs in Christchurch in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies owning social media in connection with the spread of the film recording massacre.
During the speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, remarking that machinery had been saved by dangerous workers and monotonous work at the beginning of the industrial revolution.
However, he warned that increasingly dependent on robotic equipment in order to achieve profits is the risk of depriving people of dignity from work.
"If technological progress becomes ever more and more visible inequalities, this would not be real and real," he warned.
If so-called technological progress of humanity would become the enemy of good common, it would lead to undesirable retrospectiveness to some kind of barbarism of the strongest law.
The organizers of the conference have expressed their hope of using the expertise of participants and identifying possible future advisors of the Catholic Church in high technology issues.

The crimes you have committed speak for themselves.
The murder of two children.
Trying to kill four children, and all the way to deprive them of life.
I'm practically convinced that each one of you will be sentenced to a several-time sentence of lifeless deprivation."

Posted by Krzysztof Brejza to be sued by Caesar Gmyz
"In connection with the campaign of writing TV lies, I have been prosecuting against Caesar Gmyz," said Mr Brejz, Twitter.
The reason for the prosecution is the announcement of Caesar Gmyz's publicist in the "From 20" program on TVP.
One of the leading leaders of SokemzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has great experience in the organisation of the hate department.
“The people who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagoda – founder of the “heyteric” profile – are Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych,” said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka is pages and social profiles with mems and jokes related to politics.
As the "seeds" say, the profile of this title is the PR-owiec Mariusz Kozak-Zagoda.
"We were able to find out that Mariusz Kozak-Zagoda has been employed in the Warsaw City Office, in the marketing office," wrote a week.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisory authority in connection with the close relationship with the businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
Independent IPC police proceedings will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister, whether in the course of conducting the public office as the mayor of London, he has committed an abuse of criminal offences.
The Grand London Council (GLA) stated in its statement that its supervisory inspector had registered a ‘the issue related to the proceeding’ of the Prime Minister in connection with the accusations of preferential treatment of Arcuri, resulting in a combination of their close knowledge.
“The “the issue of the proceedings” may be spoken when information indicates the possibility of a crime is made” - he said.
It doesn't mean that it was somehow proven.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine the case.
The issue was addressed to IOPC, which deals with complaints against police officers in England and Wales.
It was transferred to that police supervisory body, because Johnson was then an appropriate police commissioner and criminal commissioner.
Johnson denyed that his close relationship with Arcuri had occurred to any irregularities.
He previously said that he would apply to the order of the London City Council and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted that the Council “shall deal with the wrong problem.”
The "The Sunday Times" reports that Arcuri, the American, who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds from budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which were headed by mayor Johnson.
As a result, the government has freezed the grant of 100,000 pounds for Arcuri to Hacker House.
The government awaits a difficult question on the verification procedure carried out prior to the granting of funds.
The Minister for Digitisation Matt Warman said in the House of the Municipality that the employees of his department "usually maintained due care" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to the number reports, they were transferred to California's office, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is to live.
The close-up of the prime minister's relationship with the businesswoman "was a secret for polishenel staff".
The GLA decision to address the Prime Minister's case to the IOSC's independent police proceeding office was unsatisfactory at the 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher rank of the government, it is “politically motivated attack”, and its term – in the preceding day of the Conservative Party Conference – is “politically political”.
"The supervisor has not provided any evidence supporting the charges, and the Prime Minister has not received the opportunity to reply to it before the publication of the press release late Friday night" - says the source.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to make such a clear political act.
Today, in earlier hours, journalists "The Standard" said that the close relationship of Johnson with a businesswoman from California, which helps the Agency for Tourism and Promotion in London, was for workers of the "polisinela secretary".
The employees of London & Partners (L&P) were raised above reminded that Arcuri received places during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor despite the fact that then her companies were not considered to be "reliable".
Third accused of drug crimes in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the last year's death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and claimed to be charged with drug offences.
According to judicial documents, Stephen Walter is suspected to sell counterfeited oxycodone pills planted by fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year due to accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for "epidemia" which absorbed several thousands of human existence in the United States.
Walter's accused of delivering the pill that other man Cameron Pettit sold to Miller.
The court papers sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected to be the "curier" of Walter, who provided pettit pills.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death or none of them presented a line of defence in their case.
Walter, subject to conditional exemption in the 2005 drug case, is in custody, and he has already been sentenced to deprivation for five months for breach of the conditions of exemption.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, which was the first to report on the TMZ celebrities on Thursday, demand that Walter remain in custody waiting for a trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape from the defendant.
The answer to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer didn't come right away.
Pettit was charged with the federal court on 4 September, and his defender refused to comment.
The words of Miller's rimed songs are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, so he gained fans of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburg, Miller, who was really named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained in connection with Ariana Grande's singer in 2018.
After his death at the Instagram portal, she published a touching film with Miller and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been connected in recent years with opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, the guitarist of the 3 Doors Down team, died as a result of overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone was observed in his body.
This article amended: the correct Walter's name writer is "Stephen" rather than "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 mobile games
A 9-year-old creates a game of hidden game using a free application for Scratch 2 programming.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline modes.
So far Basil has generated over 30 games on mobile devices.
In today's game there is a bat that hides in accordance with the program.
The player gets a point every time he catches a bat who gets out of a hideout.
I learned how to create games on accelerated course.
"Now I make them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, my dad wrote it on a five-day accelerated course for children from 5 to 15 years of age.
The course, organised by Codefest International, aimed at providing access to new technologies, such as robotics and virtual reality to children like Basil.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, says Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“ When he was four, I bought him a tablet because he always got a phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," CNN's father said.
But Basil's interest in making games increased when he was seven and received a shovel for all the time devoted to games.
"One day he played the table, as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was upset," said my father.
I said, “you only play hard, can you think about making your own games so that others can play it? ”
Speaking of these words, I was upset, and I didn't think he would take it seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in teaching his own games, he inclined his parents to buy a laptop and saved it to a course during which he knew the basis for making games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his grom titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available at Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation in the continent.
Two nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been famous for using codes to create robots dividing their work at home.
In May, the band Acrobot from a female high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots to scramble boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, like Google and Microsoft, Africa, Basil and its peers are on a good way to the career of the stars of coding.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will acknowledge a lie on corruption
According to the documents submitted on Friday, the former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents in the investigation of the major political donor corruption.
According to Robin Hayes' vocabulary, he's supposed to confess to the guilt on Wednesday.
From a document containing the factual basis, prepared under the Hayes' defence agreement and signed by lawyer, Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been sealed, and it does not show the fact that Hayes will confess.
Initially, he was accused of covenant, corruption and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes to participate in the insurance company's plan of providing donations to the main campaign in the insurance market regulator country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two partners were accused of attempting to bribery the State Commissioner for Mike Causey's insurance.
Lindberg is the founder of a insurance-investment company, being one of the major state political donors in recent years, which has been transferred over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mainly supported the aims and policies of the Republican Party, but he also gave gifts to the Democrats.
His lawyer didn't answer the Friday e-mail with a request for a comment.
Hayes Kearns Davis didn't answer the Friday e-mail with a request for comment.
According to the documents lodged on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to causey about the employees of the State Insurance Department.
According to the document containing the actual basis of Hayes, he actually spoke to Lindberg's insurance commission to make changes in the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with causey and that he talked about a bribe directly with the regulator.
In accordance with the April act of accusation, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer to $2 million for the Causeya campaign in 2020.
The act of accusation shows that the contract also requires a change in the department's official which controlled Lindberg's company.
Being the Republican causes reported a alleged attempt to corruption to federal agents and helped them to gather evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to the accused act, Lindberg's partner ordered Hayes to hand over $250,000 to the causey campaign during the conversation where Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During Hayes’ conversation, he initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such money would attract attention, but, as the accusations resulted, he finally dropped.
"Whatever you all want to do is we do" said Hayes.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The federal prosecutor did not respond to an e-mail requesting further information on the settlement.

Facebook with concern for the well-being of users will hide for the test of the number of pleasures
As part of the first experiment in the world, which aims to improve user's self-esteem, some of the users using Facebook will soon be unable to see the number of pleasures, reactions and video views.
The pleasures will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented in Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Director of Facebook privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on self-confession and opinion of mental health professionals indicating that the number of pleasures can induce comparison with others.
"The sparrings of many groups working with us on combating harassment, as well as organisations in the field of mental health were really positive" - Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of content, not on the number of pleasures or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more pleasant and will not be taken as competition – said.
Garlick ensured that companies that are based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations to which they had access.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test will be extended to other countries, as it happened with Instagram when Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland were tested.
Like in the case of Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment is completed and whether the change will be implemented permanently.
"The initial comments by users on the new rules in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions" - she said.
Speaking of the place of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with a mearogenic opinion indicating whether the new experience is valuable to people using our services or not.

According to the study carried out by Pollster, in the elections to Sejm PiS would be 45% votes, KO 26%, Leftca 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
It was written on the “Super Express” portal for which the probe was performed.
The main edition of "Wiadomy", describing the same survey, presented the results of only the four first parties, completely omitting the Confederation.
The Lewandowska leader clearly underlined that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter Sejm.

It would give PiS the governments themselves.
Krzysztof Bosak in his comment on the whole situation said about “public compassion in terms of fairness to society.”
“They began with the phrases about “moral revolution”, he recalled and said that this case was a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that “““The TVP news” in the subsequent Confederation actions embarrass Urbana and Michnik.”

“ But let us also look at those who are acknowledged to remain silent.
These «rights», «independent», « improper».
In a few years they became a more primitive version of all that they said they fought with," he added.

Brother sentenced to life for killing the honorary stars of the Qandeel Baloch community media
Qandeel Baloch, which became a star thanks to the photos published on social sites, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani star of the Qandeel Baloch social media was deemed guilty of her murder and sentenced to lifetime prison as the loudest in this patriarchal country "honor murder".
The Baloch, who won the fame, publishing bold selfies, warm according to the Western standards, but in the highly misoginous Pakistan considered provoking, was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that there was no regrets for his actions and said that he “as of course” murdered his sister and that her behavior was “unacceptable.”
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told the AFP that the court in the western city of Multan, considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-term sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by the court of the higher instance" - he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, told the AFP that she had hoped that her son would be annulled.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder hit the heads of global information services and renewed the call for action against the epidemic of honorary murders, in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, dulled, they were shot or dangled for such convictions as choosing their husband, or, like Baloch, for bringing their family "styd" through manifestation of their own sexuality.
Kills are usually made by a close relative.
According to the Pakistani law of Qisas (the bloody money) and Diyat (the retaliation) they may ask the closest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted new legislation imposing a life sentence for honorary murder.
However, whether the murder is considered to be an honorary offense remains in the jurisdiction of the judge, which means that the murderers can theoretically refer to a different motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents insisted at first that their son would not show grace in any way.
However, the devastated ones think that they might also lose him, change their mind, and say that they want his fault.
The international insurrection caused by murder has made the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce itself as heir and his parents, thus exercising the case forward.
One of Baloch's more famous performances is offering a stripper to make the Pakistani cricket team and the establishment of a decoded purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, perceived it as a breaking limit in a country in which the pose for a role modeled at Kim Kardashian could be regarded as a bold and political movement to strengthen women's position.
The roots of "honor" murders lie in tribal social standards that continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular normalize women's behaviour, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from north-western Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN organization stated that growing violence caused a double number of people resettled from north-western Nigeria to about 40,000 people over the last four months.
The United Nations Refugees Agency has concluded that the concerns have created a "new exceptional humanitarian situation" which requires an inter-agency effort to collect up to the end of the year new measures of $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, Ombudsman of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic grouping of Boko Haram, which has been up to the north of the country since decade, is not responsible for the last attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina has been seen in the last 10 months is rather the result of the activities of organised armed groups.
"This is a terrifying image of anarchy and uncertainty," said the journalists on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders and sexual assaults from the offenders who also destroy houses and stolen cattle.
Military and police were sent to fight criminal gangs in the region.
However, the army is withdrawn from the fight against Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in Western Africa, which was separated from its former grouping in 2016.
“The refugees do not come with the names of the groups,” he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
Refugees are most likely to reach the neighbouring Niger.
In his statement, the U.S. Commissioner for Refugees said that he expects more people to run to Niger in the coming months along with a deterioration of the security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date of a man's trial was appointed to kill a woman and two children.
A new trial date was scheduled for a man who was accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Act of the District Court of Polk, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three murders of the first degree, as the authorities claim, the false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit it.
According to the police, he killed a 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
The judicial act shows that the new date of the hearing, i.e. on 27 January, will give the representatives of the two parties more time to prepare.
Immigration and Customs Officers of the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson, in the face of the rebellion of the office wishing to reduce the demands of Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Only three weeks before the final EU leadership summit among the most important people in the country around the Prime Minister, fears that it is not enough to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of rebellion from the office wishing to reduce demands in connection with Brext and reaching a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations there was an impasse on a new customs system which would constitute a replacement for the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels identified the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "unperformable".
The Coroner's ministers expect the EU's decision-makers in charge of the German head of Angela Merkel to offer the critical leader a compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journals spoke to three different ministers of the office, all of whom are prepared to confront with the Prime Minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominic Cummings to attempts to use the blefu against the EU and threat to leave the Union without a contract, and then to accept the offer made by the Union at the last minute.
One of the Ministers of the Bureau identified the second verde of the Supreme Court on Tuesday the end of the parliament's suspension as a "say signal" and added: "The only way we leave the European Union on 31 October is to do this on the basis of an agreement.
We'll never beat the arithmetics in the House of the Municipality that works for our disadvantage.
The Prime Minister must now bend and accept what he can receive.
Aggression doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned on a doll.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The second Minister of the Office has committed to handing Johnson to try to push the agreement to former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else is not going to happen.
The Minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to reiterate the agreement proposed by Theresa May at the House.”
There are numerous opportunities for her vote, and everyone is very interested in the end of this subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, we're done with Boris Johnson and we're all done.
John Major said to Boris Johnson that he was not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a sparkling speech, the first minister in the toris arm said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants agreements with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he's struggling with bulls in Scotland, testing the eggs in Wales and fighting with citizens on the main streets of cities – everything in front of the world, as if the election campaign had already continued for good."
The Ombudsman of the current Prime Minister admitted that the agreement was still remote and added: “No one should have illusions: to ensure a very long way of understanding.”
However, the Ombudsman also said that the Benna Act implementing the deferral of the Brexit by three months in the absence of an agreement “actively weakens our negotiating position” in Brussels.
He said: “It is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister, along with his fellow workers, is still trying to achieve progress.”
The Secretary of Brexit Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more talks will be held with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how the entire Ireland area operates for food and livelihood.
A dog without a nose and legs is going to beat up Instagram.
Perfectly inperfect
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
But it was possible to prevent it.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The dog's picture was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort's been in love with the pet since she first looked at her face.
"In the beginning, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided to take care of a bitch until she's adopted.
But no one's ever reported.
“The fact that no one wanted it has made me want it more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," she said Kate.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly inperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became the star of social media over time.
Instagram, over 14,000 internauts are watching her.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a glasg accent I would never make a career on TV.
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV heads said that because of the Glasgow accent “he never does career” as a gifter.
Reminding her 35-year-old career in Kelly's television industry, 59, she admitted that before her first performance on the screen, she felt “very upset.”
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and check-in specialist, the boss said that by my Glasgow accent, I would never succeed on TV.
I went to London to get to know the whole TV team and watch the program emissions before I took over my duties at the office in Glasgow.
I'll never forget an interview with the Bette Davis star that Anne Diamond and Mike Morris took place that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to stay.
Before Kelly became a Scottish correspondent of TV-am in 1984, she began her career as a reporter of the local newspaper in East Kibride in Scotland.
Then she started running programs like "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to launch later with her morning program "Lorraine", which took her name from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will celebrate a special program during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long internship on TV is "passion and enthusiasm" and "circumstance", adding: "You must work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When he mentions the media reports that moved her emotions, Kelly says that “very difficult” for her was to report the bombing in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children were watching our program live from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me to meet her privately, during which we talked in her house for hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral that I've been involved in.
She added that the “incredibly difficult” interview with Kate and Gerry McCanna shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that“ he really admires their strength and courage.”
They have to deal with pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and, moreover, they endure the worst comments of the online trolls.
I'm with them all my heart.
Lorraine Kelly's 35th anniversary program will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The U.S. official claimed that vice president Constantino Chiwenga rejected the offer of taking over the President's office submitted by the dead President Robert Mugabe at the top of the turnover, because he was afraid of imprisonment in order to confirm the military's takeover in November 2017.
As said last week, "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered the vice president of Chiwenga to take over the presidency during the negotiations with the military in the context of the intervene.
However, the higher public official stated in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer from fear, but because he had reviewed the Mugabe plan, which was intended to use it to prove it to world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the turnover.
In a thread on the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old Government of Zimbabwe wanted to delegate the Vice President of Chiwenga, and not the President of Emmerson Mnangagw, Jamwand 2, who confirmed that he was a higher official in the President's Office and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that at that time there were intense negotiations on the matter.
The officials of the state claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his emissaries when he realized that the authority was getting out of his hands.
The mediations between military authorities and the deceased former president had three stages, according to the higher rank of a state official.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was the spokesperson of President George Charamb, who was then the head of the Central Interview Organization of Aaron Nheper and the clergy representing the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to submit the offer to the president of Chiwenga, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (SOZ).
A man who, after death, was even more perceived as an icon of Africa, made a vain effort to obtain from the AU the condemnation of military action, trying to induce other African leaders to intervene.
The president's offer, submitted by the deceased (Mugabe) to the Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) of Chiwenga, was not due to the choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the dead family," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political temptation to help the dead to turn the situation in a completely un diplomatic way.
Just remember that the commanders claimed that they did not overthrow or reverse the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the AU position on recurrence.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, acceleratingly interrupting the claim of leaders that they did not overthrow the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the AU, which, in the margin, continued to be highly disoriented by the whole situation and the way of fitting it into its theoretical tasonomy of the reverses, would have had no choice but to describe it as a reverse, so the call for military intervention would be credible.
That's what this offer was made in the spirit and with such expression.
The officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that defense forces had no longer been ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign the resignation letter after warning the powerman that he was risking the Kaddafi style liner.
The chiefs of the army told him they wouldn't return a gun against the citizens if they were going to go to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires to save his family and prove that the army took over power," the official added.
The current SSO and commanders have properly read the assumptions.
By means of a powerful metaphor, the Messenger (Gono) who has given this desperate message has been given to the understanding that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the campus section, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, claimed a higher national official.
The officials of the state say that the army has informed the military commanders in the area through the attachés who have been in Zimbabwe that they are not going to dispose of Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding criminals.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to reuse Mnangagwa to return from short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about relapse and success.
In addition to the negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The residents of the South African Republic, which are a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because the former President Jacob Zuma was president of Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the army had driven Mugabe's house, as many times frightened in the background, the army of the South Africa would immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and the African leaders didn't choose this route," said the Independent.
China needs strong leadership, or they will fall apart, as stated by the policy document
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, otherwise the country will fall apart, said the government in a policy document issued on Friday at the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The Chinese Government press office reported in the White Paper that the country's success since the Communist authorities took over 70 years ago was brought to the leadership of the party.
China deals with a large area, has complex national conditions, but it is rarely seen by administrative difficulties.
The document mentions that without united and strong leadership, China will move towards divisions and decay, which will be catastrophic for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used hard-arm policies as if the pro-democratic protests in Beijing were suppressed in 1989, justifying this the need to maintain the stability of the country.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, in charge of the celebrations of the second anniversary of the world's size of the economy, has further strengthened the governments of the party and applied sanctions against those who may question the power.
Xi is also supervised by the military modernisation programme, which has failed to balance this region.
The document states that China does not try to export its model of development or to import any foreign models, but to peace rather than to “hegemonia”.
The Chinese don't have any other nations or domination over the world in the genes.
In modern times, China was depressed by great power, and wars and fears have pushed deeply on them as a result of suffering suffered; China will never suffer other sufferings that they themselves have suffered.
China is concerned with this anniversary in uncertain times for the country in bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to the slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in Hong Kong China.
The document says that China will never "trade" their most important interests and will not allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country’s trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that ‘the danger of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to problems’.
China has matured this economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide place on the market and a strong rate of economic development.
The paper adds that "commercial wars will never weaken it."
China is certain that they are able to face difficulties, to turn the crisis into new opportunities and to open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should reasonably look at China's development because China does not intend to question the positions of the United States or to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that they will stop China's development.
The restriction and weakness of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstanding abroad will not provide strong positions to the United States.
The world of Jack Palekiewicz: Dubai, true face
The Dubaiian Emirate is a place still looking for his own identity, dispersed between the Belgian tradition, religious radicalism of Islamic and extremism of progression.
This designating new trends of the world's leader of tourism enrichs imagination and desires, clinging the variedness of wealthy snobist hotels and attracting fortune of investors and traders with the status of tax haven.
The websites intrude by enthusiastic to this town of dreams, which are an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated architecture of the 21st century in one.
They were built on rich in the oil of sand emirates became Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are thrilled by all-presenting, appreciates creative hyperactivity and histerior pursuit.
This is a city whose motto says all: “surprise, scatter and charm.”
And almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a town without character.
As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes, “the full extremes and contradictions of the metropolitan have taken the dimension of a cheap grotesque.”
She turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the book of Guinness’s Records, an unofficial constitution of the Emirate.
Because everything here has to be bigger and better than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something among excesses and ostentational remnant, which in the old Europe is perhaps not clear but important to the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like their home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure you don't.
By running away from the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, revealing the second face of artificial paradise.
I'll figure out which one doesn't speak loudly about and not write.
I show the misery of Asian people contrasting to the fairy tales of the divine ethnic castes of Dubai, the grandchildren of Beduin.
I'm going to a place of extreme poverty, for example to ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where the army of Asian workers is under cruel conditions.
That's what they built in one generation under slave conditions reaching the desert sky of Manhattan.
They came here to see good earnings and the opportunity to ensure a decent life to their families, and they had a nightmare.
The tourist will never see it, because it could blow up the mit of Dubai for years.
An increasingly frequent criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour becomes highly troublesome for emira.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned in her home diet talks after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls team admitted that there was a ban on the use of diets in her house, after she struggled with eating disorder, for years only eating fruit and vegetables.
Spice's sports has not been eating for years and has been “obsessively practicing” as a result of the pressure of being a member of the world's famous pop group, which later caused depression and nutritional disturbance.
It now reveals that her survival affects how she raises her daughter Scarlet, and therefore “he does not allow her home to talk about diets.”
“Scarlet is now 10 and I begin to see that she is more aware of her appearance,” said Mel.
“I feel that one of the positive experiences of nutritional disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for the Women's Health Mel magazine, who won the fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls band, she said that, in the days before the social media was created, the “disgusting” of the press, the comments on it caused complexes.
"I began to look at myself in the wrong way, leaving some food groups, practicing more and more obsessive until I started having an irritability," he says.
"I was sick, and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that shocked the world
The Polish girl and American documentary gave the world a testimony of the cruelty of war.
A legendary picture of Julien Bryana can be seen in the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
"Listen to my history.
I'm talking from the city of Warsaw.
I can and I have to speak on behalf of the Polish nation about what happened here.
America must work, must help!", he started his radio documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September days of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, saw the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His relationship went wide in the West.
President of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a letter of goodbye to his family in the United States, put him in the embassy safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he's been trying to be wherever the farmers are.
400 planes and artillery almost attacked the city.
Bryan made pictures of death, suffering, the fight for survival in the nasty city.
Right before the surrender, along with the embassy's staff, he brought negatives to the ocean.
He didn't talk about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London, and even New York.”
His shocking chronicles were seen by President Eleonor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
“ Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They were making films glorifying their knighthood.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, the son of Julien.

Gold on two circles: Polish bicycle for a million golden
The golden bicycle worth a million golden could be seen at the jubilee, the 10th edition at the International Rower Fair of Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
It's an extraordinary vehicle printed on the 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Customs Roweries Show in Las Vegas.
An unusual copy made the van at the fair.
It's a unusual coating made by my friend from the Żor.
“There's a seat, they're fags, there's a steering wheel, and you could normally drive it.
It can develop the speed of 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike," precisely his designer.
‘Bike carories has been printed on the 3D printer.
It's a six-man forming a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model driving on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the drawer.
The gig waited five years for the implementation.
The bike itself formed three years," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
“ It was cruelly difficult to hide all elements under the coach.
There are batteries, wires, elements that form construction.
It's hidden under a coach removed in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's a engine hidden, too.
The wheel to this bike was built a week before my trip to the United States to the World Rower Exhibition.
I couldn't really decide what the steering wheel was supposed to be.
She's a transporter.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," summarizes.
The golden bike was appreciated in Las Vegas the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, Circular Quay port, Luna Park amusement park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge Bridge has made an important contribution to the amount of 21.9 billion dollars, annually pumped in the Australian economy by Sydney visitors.
But under the bridge, there's a ugly truth.
The famous Sydney Bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country to which the pollutant volume affects each year equals the capacity of about 15 Olympic swimming pools.
These scary statistics make one of our greatest tourist advantages at the same time one of our most nasty accents.
According to the new film material entitled "Sydney Bay, upstairs and down", waters in the surroundings of the most popular city of Australia are full of palms, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all of this flows to the bay along with rainwater.
However, the largest part of our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call this paradox" – says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, who is deliberate to publish this film on the World Tourism Day.
This akwen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated rivers walking along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that around 1560 kg of plastic reaches our waterways every hour, and the larger part of it affects the bay through storm sewerage.
"After such massive falls of the bay... it looks pretty tragic," Dr. Dafforn said.
Two thirds of pollutants come from the rainwater.
However, as with the ice mountain, the problem with the Sydney Bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, since 70% of the plastic reaching the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
“In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you can really not realise what is in the depth there,” said Richard Nicholls, the owner of Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling out about 500 kg of plastic each year.
I think if more people knew (which is underwater), they would just be terrified.
It's over half of what we find on the bottom is plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are made of plastic at least.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the other garbage we're getting right off the surface.
Jeremy Brown, the co-founder and Managing Director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourists – could help reduce the amount of plastics and residues coming into our waterways.
“It has to start with the source,” he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better lead the recovery of materials, and know more what we're dropping in the sewers that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we'll be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we've breathed comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our source of food.
But we can arrange this bay and restore it to the past greatness, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves too.
The film material, financed by the TOMRA recycling company in its wider efforts to education Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of beverage containers, which often reach the environment, is coincided in time with a study of dependence on plastics and mental health, which has been published this month.
The new survey between 546 children aged between 12 and 18 has established that 82% of respondents feel helpless to plastic waste and 25% blame adults for the problem with disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that they were increasing their concerns about the amount of plastic waste that could reach the oceans.
Many people who took part in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memy after the game of the sieves in the semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenians had a natural audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish sitters.
A lot of controversy was also raised by judges who did not count on the host side in one of the shares.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen's supporters had a chance to jump the rivals and win the first party.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles ultimately had to acknowledge the superiority of the rival, who after winning 3:1 will play the final tournament.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP Partner
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, concluded a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation aims to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the National Cloud Operator's offer, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – a centre of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global public cloud in Central Europe.
The digitalisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions which were based on the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by the Polish Bank and by the Polish Development Fund, its shareholders.
The partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road we set in less than a year ago, declaring the appointment of the National Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – the digitisation of the Polish economy and the dynamicisation of its growth.
“Now, Polish companies now get additional, sophisticated tools to implement it.
By using them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world’s league, which we care about all of us.
The fact that Google joins them today is substantially strengthening our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagiela, President of the Polish Bank.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFR strategy, as an important element of the digitalisation of the country.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also positively affect the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it", says Paul Borys, President of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the National Cloud offer will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use the same advanced technologies that their global competitors use.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," says Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of things (IoT), which have repeatedly increased the demand for the computing power needed for the processing of giant data collections.
VI General Polish Senior Parade
On the same south, on 24 August 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the Senior Parade “Senior Adolescents” began and the generations Piknik, events organized by the Foundation.
According to Przemysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation: “Parada is a global evenement.
She's already gone through the center of Warsaw six times to multiply how big and diverse the community is the seniors.
Through the Parade, we counteract the harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for solidarity between generations."
The parade was driven by a special floor coach serving for a musical mobile scene on which the traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wika appeared.

Tasmanian devils may provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have a key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that may revolving treatment for patients
Researchers in the field of medicine discovered a way of masking some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in the Tasmanian Devils and in humans
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatment for oncological patients
What do Tasman's devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that may become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolving the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include the key to treat mortal tumours within the face that threaten the future of the Tasmanian Devil.
The study established a way of masking certain cancer cells both in humans and in baggage, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which would disable a marker that would otherwise give a immune system signal to the cancer attack.
This can be the biggest challenge to treat small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and skin cancer, called Merkla cell cancer.
"The huge importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune immune therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP the chief researcher Mark Dawson from Peter Mac.
The existing therapy can be directed to reinitiate markers, proteins called MHC, allowing the system to recognise cancer cells.
"The potentially has this far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Maybe we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that someday the discovery will be used to treat the Tasmanian ďábel's face tumors, where cancer cells in a similar way avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of human tumours and in the Tasmanian Devils)" said Professor Dawson.
“As far, it was very difficult to treat the tumors of the Tasmanian Devils.
But if humans can also be used in the Tasmanian Devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists amaze the fact that there's a really small star around a very big planet
Scientists express surprise after the discovery of the solar system of 30 light-years from Earth, which undermine our current understanding of the processes of the planet’s creation, because this large planet similar to Jupiter is around a small star called the red dwarf.
The artistic illustration of the gas-type planet giant GJ 3512b circumcised around the central star, which is a red dwarf, published on September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much bigger than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of the star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is absolutely a surprise" said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales from the Catholic Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Cosmic Research, which was headed for research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low mass stars usually become maternal stars for smaller planets like Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a gas-type planet similar to Jupiter circulating around a very small star," said Morales.
The planet, which, like Jowisz, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope in Calar Alto Observation in Spain.
It circulates its star after a very elliptic orbit, and it takes 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but it has a certain degree comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% higher than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paleer than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheita / 3527 degrees Celsius).
“This is why they have red color,” said Morales.
“There are evidence of the existence of a second planet currently circumcised around this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which can explain the elite orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter,” said Morales.
Planets come from the same interstellar drive of gas and dust that is born to a star around which the planets are circling.
According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the acretion model, the object is initially formed from particulates in the disk and the force of planet gravity in the early development stage allows the atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disc around a young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold" - said Morales.
This leads to disc stability problems and therefore some dense areas may occur.
These masses can grow until the planet falls and creates.
Personnel of delicates accused of administering a co-workers of bean dip containing methamphetamine
Marion County Sheriff's office detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years of age, for administering a phosphorus collaborator containing metamphetamine.
On Thursday, Cassandra and Medina-Hernandez were accused of delivering metamfetamine and due to the consumption of that substance controlled by another person, both crimes are second-grade crimes.
The accusation was filed on the basis of the event from September 9th in the grocery store of Thriftway in Jefferson.
In the OregonLive.com portal, a statement made under oath indicating the probability of the 27-year-old suspected collaborator said to the Deputy Sheriff of the county Marion that she saw Medina-Hernandez doing a fasolowy dip, which she then took.
On the basis of the statement, the victim of a crime, which according to what she gave to the investigator, never took the metamphetamine, said that “she thought that one of the pieces she had tasted strangely, but it did not raise any suspicions.”
When she got back to work, she felt she had a stomach strain, and she couldn't stand on her feet.
As stated by the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to the local hospital, where it was established that the bean dip could contain metamphetamine.
Based on the reports of The Smoking Gun's portal according to the police, another staff of the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez “saided to add drugs to food,” while another admitted that the suspect sent her a message, claiming that the metamphetamine was accidentally hit by the fasoli dip.
The OregonLive site tells us about the recording from the delicate surveillance that allegedly shows how the back of the Medina-Hernandez is pulling something out of the bra, becoming behind the microwave and slipping.
Then it justs, wipes his nose, comes up to the table and puts a bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
The Oregon Journal of Stateman-Journal states that the Sheriff's office claims that there is no suspicion about the use of contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County County prison – the designated bail is $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police records indicate that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity stealing, metamphetamine delivery, theft, the possession of metamphetamine and the possession of unauthorised weapons.

Marian Banas.
What's the GAS doing about Chief NIK?
Renting of real estate at an amount below the market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Marian Banasia.
About what the treasure is doing in this case, we have asked in the Chamber of Treasury in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in the report for “Supervisjera” TVN raised doubts regarding the statements of the President of the High Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia.
He's been investigating the Central Anticorruption Office for months.
The check is to end in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banaś was to rent a stone with a surface of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand zlotys a year.
The "Superserjera" report revealed that the hotel was located in the building rented by him for hours.
The chief of NIK later explained on the state television why he only charged some more than 5,000 zlotys a month for renting the property.
The electoral gossip, based on real estate valuation experts, estimated that this should be 15,000 PLN per month.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a pre-contract, and the fact that the merchant had to buy the building, it made me agree to the lower rent that the remaining charges would be cleared for the sale of the building", convinced Banas.
However, there have been doubts whether such proceedings are not infringements of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesperson of the Chamber of Treasury in Krakow, in a chat with TVN24, said that “the matter is directly addressed by the Ministry of Finance”.
“Everything of these questions please refer to the Minister for Finance,” he added.
He failed to explain that in such cases “the National Administration of Treasury is running.”
The Ombudsman of the Ministry of Finance, Paul Jurek, admitted that the National Administration of Treasury, itself, monitors many cases that may raise objections.
“The Treasury Administration works in such a way that it has its own information, as well as in a sense based on the information available to the public.
On this basis, the Ombudsman of the MF has decided whether or not to conduct any specific case.
"On the other hand, because we are all involved in the rescheduling of the finances of the Treasury's mystery, so we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed, asked about Marian Banasia's case.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński underlined that ‘the tax offices do not provide such information to the public’.
"Acknowledged that the whole taxpayer is dealing with a lot of similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the royal family: surprising guests often flying the royal aircraft have been revealed
Within their duties, members of the royal family must go hundreds of journeys around the world.
This usually facilitates the royal aircraft – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world for important events and events.
It's not surprising that having a plane of its own is related to privileges.
The royal family members do not have to stand in long lines for recession, their limits are not applicable to the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, can invite any guests on board – including truly unseen.
According to the recent premiere in the Channel 5 documentary film, not only the queen and Prince Filip are often traveling by a royal plane.
During the program entitled “The Royal Flight Secrets” the queen’s flight navigator revealed that the royal family often flew the furry guests.
Bob Shields said: “One times, with our very important royal guests, the royal dogs could have fled very importantly.”
It is not surprising that the queen could have wished herself to accompany her favorites on her journeys, because it is known for her deep attachment to dogs of corgi.
Since the youngest years, Elizabeth's queen has been a lover of these four-day creatures and hears that she has been a owner of more than 30 corgs since the correlation.
They say she had five corgy in 2007: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They joined five cocker sleeping: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs who were the crossword of the corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
I'm sure the king's crew had full hands on the royal plane.
A worker of the royal house was seen carrying out the dogs and asking them to take their needs on board the plane – says Shields.
I'm glad to tell you, there's never been any incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the queen takes with her on board during the journey in the course of the duties.
The film narrator said: “In 1953, the queen took 12 tonnes baggage in her journey of 70,000 kilometers.”
To be able to show it better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only person with a weakness in fashion.
It is said that Princess Cambridge also has its own pleasure in transporting her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dresses is assigned to a separate seat.
The new law enters into force.
Injured in accidents will receive pensions
On Friday, the regulation shall enter into force providing serious damages to the next pension payment – informs the Finance Ombudsman.
This is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the specific rights of persons injured in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee sum fixed on the basis of the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
This applies to persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
They were then much lower than the current guarantee sum, so in some cases the insurers have already ceased to pay the rent.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has been seeking to create a mechanism for many years, which will allow the financial support guarantee from the OC and the OC to be guaranteed seriously, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum," says Alexander Daszewski, a legal adviser at the Ombudsman's office.
According to the Finance Ombudsman, this was essential because this is often a very tragic situation for those in very bad health, which, for example, cannot work because of accidents, while at the same time, bearing significant costs of post-income rehabilitation.
Some of them have no longer received compensatory pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums in the OC policy.
Parts threatened that in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the limits of the insurer's liability were significantly lower than the current.
Therefore, the issue of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in the previous years was most likely to affect those who suffered injury in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee sums were very low and economic conditions resulted in price increases.
“We have also noticed that this problem has also been affected by a number of young people, who have suffered damage during the period when the sum amount was 350 000 euros for each damaged person.
Today it is €5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of damaged.
So this is a huge difference in previous periods, so the problem required an intervention by the legislator", reminds Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that, since the guarantee sum is increased every time, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of the liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund would be the guarantee sum applicable at the time of referring to the pension claim to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay a pension on the basis of a judgment of a court determining a different amount of the guarantee sum than that laid down in the OC Insurance Agreement.
This is the case in case of an increase in the guarantee sum on a judicial basis pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing liability relationship.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have been asking us for intervention in the past.
We inform them of new powers and, of course, we provide further support in the event of any problems," says Alexander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini sentenced to cut off the boy's penis
The matter concerns the events of November 2017.
As Buenos Aires Times says, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed his friends a sextress that was built in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect of education, explained to the court that the partner destroyed her life and treated her like a “tropheum” that can be commended in front of friends.
“He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she said.
Cordoby's own apartment decided to measure justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she was preparing a special surprise.
With the axamic strap, she blinded his eyes, and then grabbed her sect and cut off his penis.
“ I felt like I was supposed to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled my pants up, and I grabbed my cell phone to call an ambulance," he testified to the injured.
“I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and her hair, didn't let me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by revealing sextama, she didn't try to escape from responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the direction of the jury.
Eventually, she was declared guilty to commit murder and was sentenced to 13 years of prison.
Former Congressman of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, the retired Congressman of the State of Alabama died from the Republican Party Jack Edwards, who served for the 10th term of office and belonged to the first wave of the Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The Ombudsman of the family said that Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting the pancreas cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans of the state of Alabama in the Deep South because the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 term offices in Congress.
According to the statement by the family in response to the recent question about what the world would want to leave to his lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he wanted to return courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where the common debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will return courtesy" - Edwards, according to family statements.
Governor of State Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his office and nationally with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that, in his honor, the flag of the Alabama State Capitol will be abandoned to half the mast.
“He was the person of a true state official and was the best husband of the state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most remarkable politicians," said Ivey in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" in Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed her high appreciation for Meghan Markle in Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex “the tremendous leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world become better.”
Prince and Prince Harry, currently taking a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with young people at the beginning of the week, during which they met the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, her Royal Majesty, Princess Sussex @sexroyal, "the Trouble Leader who breaks the patterns and thanks to which our world becomes better," she wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic way.
"Is it the leaders of the Obama @ObamaFoundation Foundation, or helping the girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is an inspiration to many people," she added Obama, by providing a picture of Meghan's smiley smiling with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September edition of British Vogue, a guest edited by the former Suits actress.
In a sincere conversation, the first lady was talking about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means leading to a master of forgiveness art," said Obama in an interview.
“Maternity has taught me that most of my time it is my task to give children space to know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want to be, or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being on a candle is, shared with the princess during interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
“The truth that you feel – imposed by yourself and by others – may sometimes overwhelm you,” she said.
“ My advice is to slow down and not rush into anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent mainly worrying about my daughter, making sure they're doing well at school and making new friends before I sacrificed more ambitious work.
I think that's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa maintains a permit to sell alcohol despite complaints about the attitude of the owner
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission for the control of alcoholic beverages in Washington gave a request to check whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose a permit for the sale of alcohol due to the owner's attitude.
The Agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded because most of them do not live in the district or have no property in it.
"The Washington Post" states that the second time these reasons are trying to revoke the hotel's alcohol sale permits, claiming that the applicants for the sale of alcohol have to show themselves "good disposition".
In the original complaint lodged last summer, President Donald Trump was claimed to break the law, and accusations of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the licence was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the licence.
"The Sun": The misleading report recognised by the Cleveland police scandals as the worst in the United Kingdom
Inspectors considered the SCOPE police as the worst in the UK.
In the misleading report, they evaluated the work of the Cleveland police as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, from the main police inspector of her Royal Majesty, claims that the Cleveland police departments had a "remarkable deterioration" of standards.
New calls have arisen to resolve the police departments, at which five chiefs have become in six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest the suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley, of the chief inspector of her Royal Majesty, said: “The standards have been significantly deteriorated since our last inspection.”
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after an indefinitely year in the face of an investigation in the case of serious, although unintelligible, charges on his proceedings.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after the arrest on a pleasuring deficiencies.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood became in front of the crime committee for assimilating sexual coworkers.
He's out of duty.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen said: “This is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office to be interested."
Chief of Police, Richard Lewis, said: “After perfection, I take full responsibility for conducting police forces by changes.”
We have a visualization of the skatepark!
Are the young people finally expecting each other?
Older people are interrupted by passionate young people on hulajnogs and skateboards, in turn they complain that there is no place for them in Olaw.
Youth has been asking for a place to drive on rolls, skateboards, hulajnogas, bicycles for years.
The subject keeps coming back to our breaks.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time, it went out loud again about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to it and asking the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago, a woman who was interrupted by a young man driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the inhabitants of the block at Piłsudski to be interested in the situation of the olyvian youth," writes to Małgorzat's editorials.
“The locals called the block repeatedly to the Municipal Guard ineffectively.
I'm sending photographs to evidence of such daily situations."
We asked the others about this.
Most states clearly that youths just have no place to drive in town, and for years they have been ineffectively demanding places for themselves.
In Facebook, there was a lava commentary.
We already wrote in July that there was a chance for the skatepark to be built in the Olawskie Miasteczku.
The Mayor informed that the city requested funding for the construction of a skatepark.
‘Consulted with young people, the project and the permits are ready.
On 28 March, the Ministry of Sport and Tourism was submitted to the request for funding the task “Skatepark building in Olawa” under the Sports Programme of Poland,” said in the office.
Project total value: PLN 798 306.00.
The amount of funding requested: PLN 263 440.00.
Now we asked again at what stage is the case.
"We have no information yet to decide on the request for funding to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism," reports Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the Department of the European Funds of the UM Olawa.
"The information obtained from the staff of the Ministry shows that the selection of all tasks under the Sports Programme of Poland should take place in October."
We also asked for a visualization of the Leipzig skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editorial that on Saturday 28 September, they would collect signatures under petition on the construction of the skatepark in Olava.
"The rebellious youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a collection," writes for the release of Santa.
Signatures under petition will be collected from 12.00 in the area of Lidl Market.
Pohár Polski 2019/20: drawing 1/16 final.
We know couples, hits with years ago
It was one of the most intimate competitions in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has increased the memorial match from the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legion took the old stadium at the Bathroom boat team in the last line.
Both teams shared the point.
The hosts had to win, the second of the Polish championship was given a point.
Until the 87th minute, Legion led 2:0, but for five more minutes the earthquake occurred – the Widzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź Club, over the years, was getting bigger and more troubled until he stopped counting for championship and fell out of the highest game class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legion – on the way to the title – had two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 on the exit.
Back to Elity
Today, boaters are fighting for a return to national elite.
These plans have delayed at least a year, since in previous games they have not been able to promote extraclasses in the back.
Therefore, the failure of the summer was in the club's office revolution.
The authorities have changed, finally set up as coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in doing another step up the club hierarchy, they have to help make the league fights of Marcin Robak and Matthew Możdżeń.
For now, the Widzew is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in the Polish Cup he defeated the vice-lider extraklasy Śląsk Wroclaw 2:0 on Tuesday.
Legs in the same size played on the exit of the Puszcza Niełomice.
Extraklasical startups
The only couple made up of the top class representatives in the 1/16 final formed its beniams of ŁKS and the Zabrze Mountain.
The matches of this phase will take place on 29 and 31 October.
This year was planned to play 1/8 final (3-5 December).
The final is to take place on May 2 at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr has "resurrected" and an impeachment investigation has to go on his track
You never know where we're going.
Now, I think we are involved in trying to hide the facts of trying to hide facts, and the investigation might take time," said Pelosi in an interview for the CNN in the Hill of Capitol.
“They are doing the work they have started by keeping up with the facts and the time needed to find them,” she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump asked the President of Ukraine Wołodymyr Zełenski to investigate the former vice president Joe Biden, the candidate of 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zełenski to cooperate with Barre and his personal lawyer Rudy Giulianim on this matter, as it is based on the protocol.
Trump denyed he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Ministry of Justice notified by the signaller the complaint concerning Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
Following receipt of a complaint as a statement from Intelligence Community officials, the Ministry of Justice stated that the Trumpa telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation on the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call for a witness.
She added, however, that Barr said that he “resurrected himself.”
It's been like this for a long time.
"Barra is mentioned in all this", added Pelosi referring to Trump’s referral of his prosecutor-general during July’s discussion with the leader of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions about how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi said that “he is very afraid of” about signals that Trump attacked as spys on Thursday, suggesting that he had been dealing with spys in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond their responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signals play an important role in exploring, releasing offences in our government, said Pelosi, adding “The President’s word on persons who can provide information seriously undermine honesty in the government”.
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historical step in the announcement of a formal investigation on an unlawful act based on the allegations of attempts to press on the foreign leader of the state in order to gain political benefits.
The telephone call was included in the complaint published on Thursday, in which the signalian claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "instruct Ukraine to interfere" during the coming elections of 2020.
The signator also claimed that the lawyers of the White House ordered officials to remove the record of the conversations from the computer system in which they are kept for the purposes of officials of the Council of Ministers, and put it in a system specifically sensitive to information.

Ghana: Kofi Manu is concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, Football Manager and representative of the Sekondi Hasacas Club, reported doubts about the composition of the verification committee for the elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, by adding that he was not happy with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts whether the President of the Commission will show fairness as the result of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral outside persons who do not show links to any of the members and who have not previously demonstrated interest.
For example, Daviesa hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwak Palmer for a payment of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons he should not be allowed to take a position in the verifier Commission because he is interested in it," he said.
Manu declared that, if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games, would be a conflict of interest by the President on the grounds of its association with the club, suggesting that if the Commission has a state of Palmer, he would be subject to prejudice and partyliness.
In line with the expectations, the Commission's members were to start their work from yesterday, after sworn at the GFA Secretariat in Akra on Tuesday, 19 September, and end it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are the Consultant for Corporate Management and Lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
The other members are Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
Two main parties of Israel, the Blue and White Alliance, and Likud, continued on Friday negotiations on the establishment of the government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the President's mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanjahu, did not bring the results.
The discussions considered the possibility of the rotating leadership of both parties in the government and the remainder of Netanjahu at the position of the Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli journal “Haarec” says, there was no convergence.
Talks will be renewed on Sunday.
The Blue and White Alliance informed the communication that he presented the preliminary proposals.
He accuses the rightful Likud that he was “lifted on his positions”, demanding that his leader and former Prime Minister Netanjahu remain in charge of the government, and in the composition of the cabinet, formerly in its ultraorthodox politician politician.
"Since the beginning, it has been known that the Blue-Bials will not agree to these conditions," reports published by them.
For Likud, acting solely in the interest of Netanjah, wants to “in Israel to lead to the second round of elections.”
The leader of the Blue and White Benny Gantz refuses the support of the government that Netanjahu would be in charge until he becomes accused by three Corruption Awards, on the basis of which the prosecution could formally charge him after the meeting was appointed on Wednesday.
"Likud and Blue-Biali have obtained a sufficient majority in the elections on 17 September, which would allow them to be common governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE.
President Reuwen Riwlin has tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed the appointment of the “ rotary rule”, suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspends his functions, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanjahu were sustained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelites, as shown by the survey published by public television on Friday, wishes to unlock the political situation in the country by calling the government of unity under the rotating leadership for Netanjahu and Gantza.
50.6% of the Israelites, 32.1% of the surveyed people, are behind this solution, opposing such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – a question which should be the first to stand at the head of the office, 41.8% of the respondents in favour of Netanjahu, and 40% for Gantz.
In another survey published by the “Israel Hajom” the proportion of the supporters of the government of unity increases to 63%, 60% is opposed to the new elections that would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, he won Gantz's alliance, winning 33 mandates in the 120-urban Knese, Likud Netanjahu won 32 mandates.
Netanjahu with its traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties collected 61 mandates necessary to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls to fight against Australians' final game
Justin Tipuric says that “this is the time to check out,” when Wales faced the final game with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Wales over the "kangurs" would set this team in a position of a favorite to win Group D and ensure that you participate in a likely quarterfinal meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be lightly sent back at the start with England within one eighth final.
"Let's make it clear, both teams want to try to get through this and go to the head of the group" said the Welsh Tipuric fighter.
In the past, some difficult results occurred, but last autumn was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be impatient to take this victory away, and we're going to have to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew this was gonna be a big start.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check out.
Wales had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and this happened 32 years ago in the third game when they defeated the “kangury”.
And their total record under the leadership of Warren Gatland's head only shows seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three teams of heavy weight from the southern hemisphere.
Walia tracked the 13 missing test matches from Australia's hands last November, and Tipuric was prepared to be among these few survivors from this winning 9-6, who will run to the stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team experienced a mental blockage before this victory, he added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so counterbalanced that maybe... people expect a certain mental blockage, I don't know.
At the end of the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final result looks a lot less advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then the Tipurica fight with the beloved Australian duo from the third line Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial during the arrest and defeat.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colors of the representation and met with both players at several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he's waiting for.
“There are players in the position of the seventh absolutely world class,” he said.
When you play against world-class players in the third mill line, you always know that it will be a difficult game to play.
These two are always with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the world's best players playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels more rugby because he's always in the right place in the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and challenge yourself than to face the third mill line that's not that good.
It's worth playing against the best, and fighting these two, I'm sure you have to be in top form.
I wouldn't say that Sunday is almost the final of the cup, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
The impetus is an important element of it.
When we build strength and constantly put great efforts, we'll fly like we're on wings and it'll be hard to beat.

Whitney will come back from a vacation tonight in a better mood than when she left.
It did her good to leave Walford after their terrible wedding and discover that her future husband betrayed her.
When you come home, you have a sincere conversation with Callum.
He's sending him a message that shakes him.
Callum responds badly and looks at a glass in the Queen Vic pub, which is dead by Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick).
A drunken and full of emotions Callum goes to Ben and blames him for everything that's happened.
Quiet Ben understands his explosion and tries to comfort Callum, and soon the frustration of Callum is turning into passion when a couple shares the kiss.
How's that going to happen?
The couple's planning a date next week, but Ben's thinking about their relationships might jeopardize everything they've been working on.
The Callum, who rebelieved himself, after opposing the homophobic father, is determined to fight for what he desires and deserves.

The book's premiere.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Beezer, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organisation of the "raise of masters".
They took into their ranks the people they despised.
Can a crime be more connected than a national identity?
In your hands, we don't give another book about war or military topic.
We give a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
European historians are analysing the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, reminding them of their activities and looking at recruitment processes at different stages of war.
Was the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why didn't it be possible to create a branch made of Poles alone?
What is today the official historical narrative on collaboration in different European countries?
What happened to volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the Waffen-SS book corresponds to these questions based on a solid research material.
We also strived to present a subtle and more balanced, closer truth of the image of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, attempting to break the methodological borders of historyography and the period of history by presenting the reports of researchers from different countries. (...) As long as the fate of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opposers of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population are sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are essentially examined from the national perspective (so far as it is done).
"Total panic" when the White House is faced with finding arguments about impeachment
The officials of the White House are soaked by the idea of how to deny the renewed pressures on impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" perceived last week due to the lack of a response plan for the new reality.
This seems to increase the "unrest, uncertainty and concerns" – one of the people involved in the White House describes the mood in the wings of the West – that the charges of the informant can seriously harm the President and the people of its surroundings.
The person said: “There is no certainty that nothing is hiding out there.”
The White House officials were still insecure about how to proceed, not just because there is no obvious action plan in such a situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods of avoiding the controversy applied by the President in the past may not work. “It does not look like something that passes along with the emergence of the next cycle of headlines of the message” – this person has made a joke.
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the atmosphere prevailing in the White House as a "Shock State", which is accompanied by a growing distress that, along with the ongoing impeachment investigation, the probability of the President to respond in an irresponsible manner and becomes "true to control".
This fear is shared by another interrogator claiming that the President’s survivors provide that it will show more "active" behaviour, and the pressure on it will certainly start to grow every day of the impeachment investigation.
This causes concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way explode – this is in the context of the election year, both from the point of view of the Presidency and the elections.
In order to face the greatest threat in the presidency so far, Trump was circumventing from the attack to defense, once again reaching the strategy, which he considered to be effective in the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to testify to his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in investigating his political rivals in order to distract and focus it on the activities of the Democrats and the candidates of the Democrats of Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as a leading party stimulus.
But while a lot of people in the White House are engaged in the fight after Mueller's investigation, this time something changed – advisers and consultants found themselves.
The President, whose exploratory sign is a force, the Wednesday press conference has shown to be defeated, stated one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the President's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informant had no knowledge from the first hand on this controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian President of Wolodymyre Zełenski, which would undermine its credibility.
And how often this happens when the president is the object of attacks, this fact is lively lifted by its main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists connected with the White House shows that the results of the support probes for the president are unboundly high, and the impeachment will not affect too much to obtain new sympathies.
"There is no positive in the need to focus on the president's impeachment in the next four months", especially if it makes its legislative programme difficult and prevails in a new cycle of headlines of messages.
Another caller claims that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president did not quite understand how unpredictable his response would be.
The worrying officials of the White House were looking for help with the advisers, combining a team of response to impeachment.
According to a person who knows the plans, taking into account that these efforts are in an early phase, the unclear remains whether any initiative of the command centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person has stated that there is a conviction that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leader who is able to carry out a PR attack riposting for the publication of a pathetic signalling report and in order to stop the democrats' action on impeachment provided by the disclosure of that report.
The speaker of the situation argues that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated that they were not going to disclose a note describing Trump with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no exit and need to publish the document.
It is foreseen that pressure will now be greater than in the investigation of Robert Mueller, who prevailed silence and spoke only through the charges. One of the persons who may be involved in the development of an answer to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, the man from the dirty work of Trump and former head of the election staff, has declared the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with the NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will be in charge of this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his programme – he said – but I have not participated in any conversations with the president or his team about joining the team to reject a false narrative on the impeachment."
Donald Trump's private lawyer from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in impeachment actions.
“We respond to the right things” – Sekulow replied when he was asked by the NBC News to comment.
Today, the White House has a lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked for Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of the investigation of Mueller, left, and the current advisor Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The speaker familiar with the White House's strategy stated that in general, officials at no time did not plan to engage people or to form a command centre, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, common reaction and a person who could lead a political fight.

Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "naked photos of Trumpa"
Congressman Devin Nunes from California, apparently, can't stand the naked truth about the investigation of President Donald Trump.
In his fourth defense, he accused the Democrats of getting naked photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-presented Republican in the Commission for Intelligence of the Chamber of Representatives, brought the above plea during the preliminary statement during the hearing of the reporter's complaint, as if Trump asked Ukraine to help initiate the investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotesque presentation" of the left and their "medial ace" before he said that the Democrats wanted to see the pictures of the president in negligence.
“The Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people who believed they were Ukrainian to get naked photos of Trumpa” – Nunes said.
“People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the President in the state of accusation when they have their chances in a year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimands, the political reporter of HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really try to discover it.
So far, he replied solely to Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we suspect that his answer is naked truth, confirming the thought of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
Portal Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' comments on nakedness relate to "the more luxurious and unconfirmed information" which are likely to appear in Steele's controversial acts,
It is famous, gathered by the former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the probability of a tape that says shows him how to look at the prostitution in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesli dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be to leak renewable energy – aircraft.
However, the professor at Albert University has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as aeronautical fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Albert at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environment Sciences, which began working on this project in 2003.
His lab produces hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fat waste such as restaurant fat, animal fat and rape oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from oils of lower quality during production, which estimates that are 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as the use of waste from other industries.
This technology is intended to immit hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation – said Bressler – it is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical particles as diesel fuel."
While it opens the new possibility of using biofuels, the previously developed biofuel products have had a tendency to destabilise at lower temperatures, which, in the case of airplanes flying at high levels, constituted a serious risk.
"The problem with air fuel is a bit of a misleading wheel" said Bressler.
It's actually less worth it than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of air biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuel and hydrogen added.
The second option is to continue working on partly developed chemical properties that will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit," said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The company established by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons is working on co-mercialisation of the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American army, are increasing investment in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and the coal tax will be imposed on them" - he said.
Instead, they want alternatives to be an emergency plan.
Currently Forge runs a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and recently received a total of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in an investment to support the 25 million production facility, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million liters of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the targeted carbon reduction will be about 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will continue to reduce carbon.
"As a technology specialist, Bressler said:
I have the task of developing options that enable conscious decisions and many options to choose."
ASSESSMENT: Another granddaughter fraud
8,000 zł and 750 euros lost the residence of Zamościa, thinking that he was helping his grandson who caused the accident.
The police informed about the event on Thursday the son of a fraudulent order.
"He called a woman on Wednesday, a man who would come up for her grandson.
He told me he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
In order to help her grandson, she passed 8,000 zł and 750 euro to a fake police officer who came to her house," reports the Ass. Dorota Krukowska-Bubilo from Zamosian Police.
The police are looking for the perpetrator and once again they ask for caution:
‘Every phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Don't act under the influence of emotion and in a hurry.
Let's just remember, the cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we get a call for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should react immediately and notify the police by calling alarm number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the threats, let's tell us how fraud works.

The allies of Prime Minister Boris Johnson warn that in the event of withdrawal of the Brexit, the United Kingdom threatens the ZAMIESZKI, such as Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace
One of the main ministers of the office said last night that the national threatens to "violent social breaks" if the original result is questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
Allies of the Prime Minister of Great Britain from its nearest surroundings warned that the nationals threaten social concern on the scale of the protests of the "black vests" in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "satisfiment of moods" during a stormy fight on the policy language, but stressed that it would not stop using the word "subject".
Despite his call for peace, the Minister of the Office said "The Times": "In this country, there were never protests such as the demonstrations of the "Giletes Jaunes" or the inhabitions in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – the jaunes gilets – they use encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate the pictials, and to push people to protest a few unwanted populist leaders.
The riots in Los Angeles have exploded after the jury have brought down four white policemen who beat up a black cab driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, the anti-government demonstrators in France carrying yellow reflective vests – Jaunes gilet – for more than six weeks deserted and devailed Paris streets.
The Minister referred to the warning of Johnson in the House of the Municipality and said that if the United Kingdom fails to leave the EU, “the catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system will be”
"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people vote, and 66% of them will speak for the stay of the United Kingdom in the European Union, ten million people will remain unsatisfactory" said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
There's not much to see on the street soon.
One of the main ministers of the office added that the country threatens to "violent social breaks" if the result of the first referendum was questioned by the outcome of the second.
Johnson called for universal elections in which the voters would decide the fate of the Brexit.
According to the reports, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of rebellion to reduce demands in relation to Brexit and reaching a compromise agreement with the EU.

Follow us Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants heard on Thursday (26 September) 11 inspiring speeches of the speakers, including Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for a fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of horizons, discussions about ideas worth of publicity and joint discussions that can become an impetus to further development.
Such a goal was set before the conference organizers of the Talk'N'Roll, inviting 11 special speakers, representing very diverse sectors and areas of interest, and among them people known from the media - Szymona Hollownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneus Krosny.
The password this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and just about the future creation focused on the presence of guests invited to attend the conference.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Poland, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told us about the brand that is built around each other could have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went to the stage to change the audience's perception of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if they want to be a future, and Chris Badura, in turn, took the subject of empathy in the time of the rapid development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) has shared observations and techniques that can help to manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-quarter conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, which, among other things, spoke about how the profession of the teacher in Poland changed from its perspective over the years.
The holder of one of the most popular votes in the country admitted that – thanks to the development of technology – today, everyone can be difficult with this profession.
However, he does not think that in the forthcoming years a person is fully replaced by technology.
Thereafter, Peter Nabielec took the problem of life in the time of overload of information, emotional or overloads in the matter of choice, giving the audience valuable clues, how to deal with him, and Luke Łutoch in his speech spoke about what another industrial revolution, known as "industrial 4.0".
The storyteller teaches, teaching fun
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions, inviting an illusionist, Daniel Jediak.
In turn, the third part of the conference was opened by Ireneus Krosny, who first played the pantonime audience, and then, on the example of his own career, told how he was trying to maintain the right balance between careers on the stage and private life.
The participants also kidnapped Szymon Holovnia, stressing the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes could diametrically change the situation and need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, the House shared his thoughts on the reality surrounding us, calling for the anecdotes that could cause a smile on the audience's faces.
Then Adrian Tworuszka appeared on the stage, who reviewed the history and objectives of several models of innovation and refers to how they are used today.
At the end of Marcin Słowak, on the example of Rubik's ankle, he told about the approach to solve the problems.
Each of the 11 speakers surely brought something new in the perception of the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the natural reactions and numerous questions to the guests indicate a great commitment from the public.
The organizers have provided a transmission for all who could not personally participate in the event, and videos from the lecture are available on the website.
Right governments instead of the rule of law.
"According to the lack of sufficient number of votes to change the Constitution, the majority introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating a threat to the protection of the rule of law and the rule of three division of power", writes in the Helsinska Foundation of Human Rights published on Thursday.
The "Regional Governments instead of the rule of law" report, inter alia, documented changes in justice and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedom.
The Helsinki Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled ‘The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Threats for the protection of human rights in Poland between 2015 and 2019."
The Foundation believes in the report that the biggest regres in human rights protection in Poland was recorded in 2015-2019 after 1989.
"According to the lack of sufficient number of votes to change the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating a risk to the protection of the rule of law and the rule of three division of the authority.
By adjusting the right to political objectives, governments have been replaced by law," says HFPC experts.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the justice, independent institutions (such as public media and Ombudsman) and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedoms of assembly, women's rights, rights of LGBT and the right to a fair process).
The report also summarises the dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
"In the last four years, we have seen the use of the right to exercise participatory interests for the first time and on this scale.
This was translated into the ongoing ruler crisis, as well as to weakening the entire system of human rights protection in Poland", stressed Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As stated in the report, the last four years are "the period of systemic changes both in the country" and "the protection of human rights".
Over the last four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 key legislation in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes were often accepted in a hurry, without public consultation and despite the objections of the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations", explained the lawyer, Mr Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed in the last four years are: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), not respecting binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and weakening the protection of human rights".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation of Human Affairs considered “the situation in which the authorities did not respond or disregard the emergence of aggression.”
The foundation experts noted that some changes were introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the state activity in the area of restriction of the rule of law is a ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations by international law entities.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland as a leader of democratic transformation in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also threatens the Polish State to be responsible for infringements of the European Union's law or the European Convention on Human Rights", we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media stars with life for honor killing
Women's rights experts say that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of the prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers for bail and the confusion of cases in public awareness.
"It is so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, defending women's rights and founder's first gender studies in Pakistan, and adds that even the wide-ranging Baloch murder case has been settled for more than three years.
Although, according to women's rights groups, fair data are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Committee on Human Rights in 2018 has concluded at least 300 cases of honorary murders.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and the network that promotes awareness of honorary crimes estimates that Pakistan is about one of the fifth of the 5,000 honorary murders committed every year worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the transfers to the country are decreasing, because many migrants outside Poland perpetually report "Rzeczpopolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries were over PLN 8.6,000 in 2018, which means that nearly a thousand zloty, which is almost 12%.
“The Euro-Tax estimates that the total income of Polish earning emigrants in the EU has reached a record value of PLN 154,5 billion in 2018, one more than a year before,” we read.
The Director of the Centre of Research on Migrations of the University of Warsaw, Paul Kaczmarczyk says that the Poles are getting better and better on the international labour market where they use various options available.
"The number of specialists and professionals who are increasingly moving from the country to the country, as well as international corporations employees," says the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries, e.g. the UK and Germany in a year.
“It is in RFN in 2018 most, because by 11%, the total earnings of Polish immigrants increased (about 27 billion PLN).
However, the most Poles earned in the islands – almost 35 billion zł", we read further.
The President of Euro-Taxu believes that, despite improving the working conditions on the Polish market, the number of wage migrants is not decreasing.
Because saxes in the West and the north of Europe (mainly with Norway) are often a chance for several times higher wages than in Poland.
"And even at minimum rates in the country concerned, which, for example, amount to EUR 9.5 to 11.7 per hour in Germany," reports the journal.
“Polishpolitan” states that the Poles are not only due to higher earnings, but also because they were home to abroad.
Many Poles are setting roots abroad, which are also seen after decreasing money transfers to the country.
These last year were the lowest in years.
As the economist, Tadeusz Chrosticki, together with the extension of the period of residence abroad, a group of people passing money to the country decreases.
“Emigrants are bringing close to each other,” we read on Friday “Rzeklish.”
Prolonged monsoons cause flooding and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India is now prolonged by almost a month, and the unprecedented rainfall causes death as a result of the congestion of buildings and the gnicia of many yields.
Usually, in northern India, monsun disappears in early September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian meteorological department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsun since decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unprecedented – recently in the west of India, Pune Wednesday and Thursday rainfall led to the death of several people and desolation due to the collapse of buildings.
There's been a flood of houses, people's streets in the water on their knees, which normally only occurs during apogeum monsun.
Large rainfall occurred also in cities such as Kalkuta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
Due to the long rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses have been destroyed.
Monsun also started delaying.
In many areas there were lacking water, so farmers prepared for likely drought.
The long-term monsun is not welcomed by farmers.
That amount of rain isn't normal at this time of year.
“For him, my vegetables – and now I have a sausage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot”, says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of delayed and the late ending monsune means an increase in the price of onion, i.e. an indispensable ingredient of Indian food.
Onions, which usually had to be paid for 20 rupees (0.23 pounds of UK), currently cost 80 rupees (approximately 1 pound) in cities such as Delhi and Bombaj.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival is Dasar's 8th October holiday, during which Hindus raises huge bouquets like from a comic book that presents Ravana, a character of a buzzy moustache and a cruel smile from the epose "Ramajana".
Smoking Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's similarities were made of paper, if the monsun continues, Ravana will laugh last.

Doodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine the world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the questions that bother us.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "How many?" is one of the favourite categories of Poles.
The giant data indicates that last year we were willing to ask: “Where is the storm?", “How to make potatoes? ” and “How many fingers have horses?”, “How to get rid of the must of fruits?” — How do you eat cocoa?
Today, the search engine celebrates the twenties of the first birthday.
Her users – and in Poland up to 96% of people use the Google Uncle – welcome today the special Google Doodle.
He's not animated this time.
Google reminds of its birthday, showing a steady computer with a monitor, mouse and a keyboard, and in the right, the bottom corner was printed the digital date – like on the picture from the 1990s.
Synchronising folder
The search engine was designed to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from a mathematical googol term which means the number of ten raised to the hundred power.
This name was also intended to reflect the intentions of an undertaking to indict as many parties as possible from the world's resources of the Internet.
The Google search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the dependence between parties that worked better than the usual results segregation methods based on the frequency of the occurrence of the frequencies.
At the beginning, the search engine was named BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company operating under Google Inc. on 7 September 1998 and soon later launched the famous Google.com website today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" appears information about the extremely high performance of Google's search results.
Then the story of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - lightning development with each month, hit further markets and increase the value of the company.
In June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion positions, which makes the work of Page and Brina gain the largest website search engine in the world.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players in the IT market.
Is there any other field to develop?
"The Google mission is to organise the global resources of information to be widely available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this field, it is still a long way to achieve this goal," he provided in a conversation with "Newsweek" Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that working with exposure to contact with plant protection products in large concentrations can be translated into a high risk of heart problems in later years of age.
This happened in the case of a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, which has been investigated for more than 30 years.
Scientists have established that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more exposed to heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need for personal protection equipment to be used for the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical records of contact with such measures at work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase heart disease" - said the co-author of the study by Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results were based on data relating to over 6,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in the cardiological program Kuakini Honolulu.
As the researchers pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations as it concerned only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so the effects of their health effects can be known for themselves many years after contacting these substances.
In this case, the most apparent results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
In the press release, Rodriguez said: “After 34 years of men's observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart diseases was no longer significant.”
This is probably because more important factors have become associated with ageing which have masked possible causal relationships between exposure to the contact with pesticides and vigorous circulatory disease in later years of life.
Researchers have not discovered a significant relationship between exposure to low to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of cardiac or stroke disease.
Telephony call Green-Trump: Poroszenko throws his three peas
Washington's policy has a stormy week in connection with the opening of an impeachment procedure against the American President Donald Trump.
The political scandal is for the political debut of Vollodymyr Zelenski, which would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zełenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the first one?
Almost at the opening of Trump's phone call, he declared that the United States would do more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not full, they describe the Trump attack on Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel for the fact that German leaders and other European leaders are involved in the negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
The controversy raised the Zelenski answer that said that he agreed to Trump not 100%, but in 1000%.
Zelenski added that both the French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of sentences has made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, choose to speak through social services.
Petro Poroszenko, former President of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the support granted by the EU was "without a precedent".
In other tweets, Poroszenko said that he was grateful for the support of the EU in the "Russian aggression" which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including the Ukrainian policies, Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we now speak with Germany and France? ”
Trump then mentioned military assistance and asked Zełenski not to investigate in one, and two cases: the first of Joe Biden's son - Hunter – and the other relating to the breaking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the hacker attack on the e-mail boxes of the Democrats during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether European relations or if relations with the leader of France and Germany will be discontinued.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
Thank you to all assist us" - said after the publication of the report of the Zelenski telephone call in New York during the UN General Assembly.
The Green is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming Summit of the “The Four of Standards”, which will take place in October.
Former voivodships Inspector of the Rights has been guilty
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski from his actions being rejected.
After six years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was ultimately cleared of charges.
The District Court in Thinking cleared Jerzego Wiśniewskiego, former Chief of the Military Inspector of Trade Inspector of Agriculture and Food Arts in Rzeszów, from the allegation of overcapacity.
The Lublin Prosecutor rejected him that he had to betray the term of control in the plant producing food oil to the Marshal of the voivodship.
A legal sentence has just fallen into this matter.
The appeal was recognized on September 12th.
"The judgment held by the defendant," confirms the judge of Małgorzat Reizer, the Advocate of the District Court in Thinking.
This is the judgment of 14 February, issued by the Regional Court of Thinking.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on Facebook: “It was six years since I was presented by the Appeal Attorney in Lublin to the alleged violation of the law in a phone call with the Marshal of Podkarpacki Voivodeship on 30 April 2012.
The court said clearly that I was innocent and that I did not break the law in force.
I was convinced that my phone call then with Marshal Podkarpacki Voivodeship was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Appeal Attorney in Lublin passed true and caused irreversible damage to both the food producer and the loss of the image of my person at my employers, among employees and in the local community.
The act of accusation made to me in the Court's opinion contained a number of mistakes, false facts, irrelevant legal evidence, not confirmed in the reality of events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
Then I was immediately released from work and deprived of funds.
I've stayed a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remind you.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as a voivodship inspector for the commercial quality of agricultural and food articles between 2009 and 2013.
He was revoked from the position after the prosecution of Lublin in 2013 brought him a plea.
According to the investigators, he had in a phone call to betray the Marshal of the voivodship (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to four years of deprivation) the time limit of control in the plant producing food oil belonging to the wife of the former vicemarshell of the subcarpace.
This warning, as the prosecutors of Lublin said, was intended to make the company owner know about the control and correct the labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard the allegations of excess rights for which he was threatened to deprive in three years of freedom.
“I feel relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had not done anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the lawful sentence that has annulled me from the charges against me," commented Jerzy Wiśniewski.
White House was trying to hide the record of conversations with Zelenski
On Thursday, the editor wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with the President of Ukraine Wołodymyre Zełenski, asked for an intervention of a foreign state in the elections in the USA, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated on 12 August, a signalist, who is probably an interview worker, wrote: “In the framework of my duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his function to demand an invasion of a foreign country in the 2020 elections in the United States.”
“Trump used part of the discussion (from Złoenski) to carry out his own interests.
And precisely, he was struggling on the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the President in the 2020 reelection, says the report quoted by the "The Hill" journal.
The Ukrainian leader has been “to be understood” that the contacts with Trump are dependent on whether the“ willingness to take the game” in matters that he was supposed to inform President Rudy Giuliani more specifically about.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the discussion, but stresses that he was informed in detail of its content by “a lot of White House officials who had direct information on it”, and their relations were covered.
“In the following days after this conversation, I learned from many American officials that the high ranks of the White House were intervened to “satisfactory” all the archive records on this conversation, and in particular the literal record that was drawn up, as usually done in the White House crisis room,” we read further.
“The High Officers of the White House told me that the lawyers of the White House “instructed them” to remove electronic records from the IT system where such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store information particularly confidential and manipulate them," wrote the report.
"In my assessment, these steps prove that the officials of the White House were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," he assessed the signalist.
As the AP commented, this document will probably accelerate the case of the President's possible impeachment and also contains valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The record of the talks with the White House, after the pressures of Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of the people who were witnesses.
The content of the report, in the edited version, revealed the interview committee of the Chamber of Representatives one day later.
Joseph Maguire also testified on Thursday the responsibility of the American Intelligence Director before the Commission of the Board of Representants and explained the way the intelligence report had been treated.
Maguire said that the signalist made the right choice and did the right thing.
He also underlined that his opinion that the talk with Zelenski was an event of "no precedent".
The Democrats in the Intelligence Committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the report to Congress; the director of the interview said he had no authority to disclose his content, whose confidential character guarantees the privilege of the executive authority.
Part of Maguire's hearing was held by the committee behind the closed door.
On Tuesday, the president of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Representatives informed that, in the light of the suspicion that the president had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm its potential competition in the next presidential elections, the Chamber of Representatives has initiated an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she assessed that the record of Trump's discussion with Zełenski confirms that the President of the United States broke the election and safety standards.
The electoral law in the USA prohibits the use of foreign state assistance.
On Thursday, the White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation, and in the report, “there is nothing more than a set of relationships from the third hand and adhesive press cuts together.”
"The White House will continue to criticise this media hysteria and a false narrative promoted by the media of the mainstream", she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO prizes
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the ongoing 40th International Civil Aviation Assembly (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was granted in proof that Ghana has obtained the highest number of aviation security surveillance points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 percent in the temporary pace of effective implementation (EI).
This was the case when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Safety Authority's Universal Audit Programme.
The security prize was evidence of the recognition of a high country involvement in the implementation of ICAO standards and security protocols at airports and in Ghana airspace.
The award programme was developed to provide support for the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition, the ICAO Member States, which improved their safety and security standards, were granted 16 other safety and 17 certificates in the field of protection.
During the awards of Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director-General of the Civil Aviation Office of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana, Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Governor of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain safety in the airspace by the Member States.
He said, "We should constantly remind ourselves that even in the age of innovation, security and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities."
Mr Adda, on his own, noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the efforts of the state, because they are a compliment to the heavy work and endurance of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for the development of the country's economy, saying, "aircraft has a powerful opportunity to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from security and security that we have achieved."
ASSESSMENT: Tanked and ran, stole the bike, too.
The 50-year-old of the Municipality was driving his Audi under the distributor, refueling and leaving without paying.
That's how he robbed gas stations several times.
A man stole a bicycle from one of my own offices a month ago.
The gas station owners valued the losses of almost 1,000 zł.
The owner of the stolen bicycle – at 2,000 PLN.
On the past Tuesday, one of the Zamosian districts spotted the U.S. Audi, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
There was a 50-year-old looking behind the steering wheel.
The man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday he heard the charge of theft of fuel from 4 gas stations and the bike.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
The uniform also found the stolen bike.
The one will soon return to the owner.
For stealing a thief, the penalty for depriving freedom is at stake by the age of 5.
Trump nominated by Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting as the administrator of the Federal Agency for Crisis Management (FEMA), smiles at the meeting of the Senatic National Security Subcommittee on the FEMA budgetary proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Hill in Washington on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday American President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as Head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor is the Head of the Agency, who supervises government response to disasters such as storms or forest fires.
The agency operated without the administrator approved by the American Senate since March, when Brock Long fired this position.
Long resigned after the Department of National Security of the United States, which is under FEMA, said that Long used government vehicles in the wrong way to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this post, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough examination of his past revealed the charges that he was involved in a fight in a bar.
Gaynor's nomination was expected for this position.
In order to approve his nomination for this role, the majority in Senate will be required.
The White House informed that before Gaynor in 2018, he was the deputy administrator of FEMA, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in sea infantry.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering the amputation of the finger
28-year-old runner specialized in a distance of 1500 meters, winning a gold medal of European championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the vice-president of Europe at 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new problem and that he had already undergone one operation just after the games in 2016, but the pain has returned and has been very strong in the current season.
The pain makes me put the foot, which in turn changes the system of my body, occurs other unnatural burdens and begins to feel pain in other places, for example in the weather.
For this reason I couldn't prepare enough for the world championships, and for two weeks the pain is so strong that I have difficulty setting the collars – said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach of the Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with the son, they concluded that the only solution that he would not end his career and participate in the future Olympics in Tokyo will be amputation.
It looks like it's the only thing, even though the drastic solution and the decision has already actually been made.
“If part of the body hurts, it should be rid of it, and Henrik does not need that finger so much, and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect,” he explained.
Police shut down an illegal e-papyros factory from the marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, the police closed an illegal e-papyros factory with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building standing at 9600 Telstar Avenue around 16:37 there was a raid, during which the police searched illegally for the sale of e-papyros containing marijuana and during which large salts were found containing butan fire oil – concentrated from the Indian hemps.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano, El Monte's police officers also found a device used to supplement the lime cartridges.
“This process is very dangerous,” says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The usual electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the ignition of these vapours, causing not only fire, but because of concentration, even the explosion," he says.
“ If we have a lot of jars in the room and similar ones, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only fire, but also an explosion that could fit the entire complex from the surface.
A team has been called on for special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is not known at the moment.
Detectives say they received an anonymous clue that allowed them to get a search warrant for illegal activities.
Investigators are still trying to get information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person founded an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing, and officers want to be sure that illegal products have not hit the street, taking into account the recent articles on calcium harm.
“People really don’t know what products they buy,” says Cano.
“They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This could be a threat to our community and children, and that's why we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has made the choice of medicine for pleas
The main Pharmaceutical Inspector informed that the medicine was withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used for the treatment of fossils and yeast infections of the mouth mucous membrane, infections with Gram-Additional bacteria.
It can also be used as helpful to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product has been withdrawn because it does not comply with the requirements of the quality specification of the product's scent and the decrease in the contents of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenatory Laboratory in Olsztin.
On average, each month, GIF shall issue several decisions to withdraw each series of products from the market.
Serie of the discontinued drug in Poland can be re-entryed once the safety evidence has been provided.
If the medicine is withdrawn, there is no possibility.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collector banknote about this?
He nominated 19 golden and saw the image of Ignatian John Paderewski.
In early October, the new collector banknote will be introduced into circulation – informed the National Bank of Poland.
It's another "Independence" banknote.
It is intended to commemorate the creation of the Polish Securities Markets Producer 100 years.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the banknote, January 25, 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the creation of the PWPW.
Also nominal value, PLN 19, refers to the year of creation," says the NBP communication.
The water mark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
The new holographic belt is placed on the window in the floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignancy John Paderewski, and adjacent to the title “Independent” was presented to the stylized image of the order of the White Eagle.
The letter from the manuscript of Joseph Piłsudski is the logo of the 100-year trades of the recovery of independence by Poland.
In a branch of vavarine, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect.
On the side of the reverse banknote, the image of the house was placed by the manufacturer on the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
It is built in SPARK Live and opalescent belt PWPW, which is also visible in the UV light in the form of repeated "19" and "NBP" abbreviation, describes NBP.
The banknote is to enter circulation on October 2, 55,000 pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those of special series, are a legal payment measure in Poland.
However, their nominal value significantly exceeds the one that can be achieved on the collector market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, or more than $2 million, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded to the bar.
That's where he sailed through the river 50 miles.

The Book Fair of Christmas is coming.
We meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
They say they don't read books.
We'll show that it's different," she said at the Mart Półtorek press conference.
And who will support readers in Rzeszów this year?
As we have heard, the sister of Anastasia will appear at the fair, shouted by the first Teacher of the Republic of Poland, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyn Bond, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn in Millenium Hall will take place a great cultural event – 22 and 23 November to the shopping centre will welcome the 3rd edition of the Christmas Fair of Books, which is one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and accounting officers from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be 30 of them, and among them will be Agora, the sign, the SQN, the PWN and the Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide publishing offers and hundreds of new books that the participants of the fair will be able to buy at attractive prices.

The star of this year's fair will be the sister of Anastasia, the author of a dozen books (including cooking) sold in more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of missing Elizabeth's dress and Hampton Court Palace
A silver thread of a dress made of the most marked silk rocket was cunningly decorated with hafts representing vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, the probation officers of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, it meant only one thing.
The fabric, hanging 100 years on the wall of the small village parish church, which she looked at, could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's dress.
Three years after Lynn encountered an exhibition of altar fabric in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elżbieta's missing dress was supposed to be at the Hampton Court Palace exhibition next month, close to the same rooms where the queen of the Tudor dynasty could wear it over 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dresses, only one element of the 16th century dress survived.
Although there is no evidence that Elizabeth has ever worn this dress, three years of research have strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal garderoby.
"Srebrogles", an amazing way of fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoser quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the dress was one of the most outstanding persons.
The dress could cost the equivalent of the Tudors' property when she was sealed.
“In the 1990s, Elizabeth’s reign, she felt a threat from other women outside, and would not tolerate rivals carrying such fabrics,” said Lynn.
“ As a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the dresses.
I was really happy to see the dress, and they were practically convinced that we had a part of the royal wardrobe.
Long, re-use dress, cut to serve as an altar fabric in the dark St Faith church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry came, the nearest Elizabeth of the court, who served the queen throughout her long life and with which the local legends were identified by the said fabric.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to Parra's family or parish to remember Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of maintenance work, four hundred of which died on the most profound hand sewing with specially painted silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will be placed in the exhibition next to the exhibition rented for the time by the Hatfield House Palace of the portrait “Rainbow Portret”, one of the most famous pictures of Elżbieta in a similar skirt.
"During the work with historical fabrics, it really begins to respect the harness of people who have done it," says Libby Thompson, the head of preservative works, whose larger part took place in a glasshouse in Hampton Court Palace – the only large place to put some of the priceless gobelins.
“ Looking at the hook in front and in the back, I began to feel great respect for those who did it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" exhibition will begin on 12 October at Hampton Court Palace
Fitch has confirmed the Polish rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in foreign currency at the level of ‘A-’ – given in the Communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-distributed economy, which is supported by sound economic policy and a strong banking sector", reads the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the cycle, and between 2019 and 2021 the real growth rate of the National Product Brutto in Poland would be 4,1 percent, 3,3 percent and 2,9 percent respectively.
The Agency forecasts that government deficits to GDP for 2020-2021 remain below 3 percent, respectively 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent.
"The government debt index to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent according to the Agency and will be less in the following years (average 48.3 percent in the period 2020-2021)" we read.
Rating of Poland
On October 11, the Autumn Round of Reviews of Polish ratings will be completed by S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in the evaluation of Fitch is the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the Agency confirmed the Polish rating at "A-" level with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland’s creditworthiness is most estimated at the level of ‘A2’.
The rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The perspectives of all evaluations are stable.
What's the rating?
Credit rating agencies arise to help investors assess the risk assessment of their investment activities.
The rating shall be granted to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each evaluation shall be translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing other than credit credibility.
On the basis of it, you decide who and how much to lend money to.
Sometimes such information suggests who is best not to give any credit at all, because there is a great risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest in credit.
Each assessment must be justified and accrued.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case, agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the world market for credit rating services control three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each one uses its own assessment system.
"Friday of Confederation": First 1000 plus
The "Friend of Confederation", the main assumptions of the electoral programme, presented the candidates for the Sejm district of 40 for a mandate from the list of KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence on Friday.
The leader of the Košalina List to Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the password "five Confederation".
"The first program of 1000 plus for Poland, secondly the rapid and fair courts, third of the Cultural Covenant and the World Covenant, fourthly national security, after fifth it is a healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "Polices must finally start making good money," so the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the amount free of tax will resolve itself".
"The Poles must be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and a voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list of the assumptions of "program 1000 plus for Poland".
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadencka, starting from the second place of the list, referring to the programme password “healthy life” said that “food is getting worse and to change this, it is necessary to “support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture” in favour of crops free from GMOs.
As she said, the Confederation is also advocating the termination of "seed hemps".
Zadencka declared the Confederation's support for "the development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also spoke on behalf of her group for "good vaccinations".
"The right to conscious consent cannot be broken," she added.
Another candidates in Sejm from the Kosalina district stressed that Confederation is behind the "good reform of the judiciary", which would be part of dealing with the case by the judge "day after day".
They also said that the educational subsidy should go to schools without government intermediaries, i.e., according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also behind “the strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers”.
The candidates to Sejm underlined the need to increase the number of armies.
According to them, it also needs easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "continuous access to energy".
"We can gasize coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy deposits, and we also need to consider returning to the idea of the nuclear power plant," said Peter Karpiński on the electoral list.
Chief of Mexican cartel is behind one third of the drugs in the United States.
Chicago is just after the sunrise at the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported the morning traffic after drugs.
Brian McKnight of the DEA fight Office has shown in full light what's going on.
Last year, almost 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said, "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA is focusing on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known as El Mencho.
"He is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the federal executive authorities in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The award for El Mencho is about $10 million.
He helped discover dozens in the jungle of El Mencho drug laboratories.
It belongs to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the United States by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, cartel smuggled cocaine, metamphetamine and contaminated heroin.
El Mencho's head is a prize of $10 million.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a massive amount of weapons, RPG, guns of a calibre of 50.
He basically owns his own SWAT team," added Donahue.
El Mencho is punishingly protecting his empire, using such measures as shooting down the Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, cartel brutality led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, about 94 murders happen every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine lab, it's a smuggler brand.
For more than one third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
“He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children,” said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue thinks there's a "a lot of chance" that drugs are from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year of overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – claims the French Attorney.
The defendant will ensure that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He demanded 300 thousand euros in cash from the state's boss.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police, claims that he received documents from the person employed in the Elisian Palace.
During the hearing, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but revealing them entirely may threaten the security of Macron and the first queen of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded EUR 300,000 – he also wanted to get the apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in the previous marriage.
According to the D.A., the defendant refused to hand over the police's documents he was talking about.
He foretold that he would give it to the media – but it is not yet known that these documents really exist.
They weren't found in the apartment during the audition of that 27-year-old.
A man has been subjected to psychiatric studies, but the doctors have not identified any serious disturbances.
PS4 game will be old-school – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debuting game soon available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony in the recent State of Play presentation announced that the Sequel Prime Minister The Last of Us will be held in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathing in the breast games from the upcoming action game.
More particulars were revealed in days after the loud premiere of the The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old-school climate in many ways.
It has been decided on something that we haven't seen too often since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in the brilliant interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel grew to one of the most extensive games in history.
"The film is ambitious and has fallen into aspects in which the one was not in" - he said.
She must have been so wide to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We didn't intend to create the most obscure game, it just happened.
"There will be moments when you think you're headed to the end, but you'll realize that it's only the beginning and that the whole new chapter begins," says Druckmann.
It's such an ambitious game that she didn't fit in on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two eastern eggs with adult content (information given by Gamestpot).
We won't spoil surprises, but the eggs appearing in the Easter game appeal to the old-school work of the Naughty Dog.
You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two will debut on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the sequel, reaching the Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free games on PS4 offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the above production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to make a premature order on the sequel, Sony said that there will be a lot of versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelets and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult character.
Run, scratch and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskid and will win.
Stomil's pillars from three rounds are inconvenient.
The caretakers of Peter Zajączkowski at that time gained seven points because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match the gateless draw in Suwałki.
Now, the Olsztin team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is exchanged as one of the favorites for the promotion to the Extraklasa.
The nearest Stomil rivals take the fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the Olsztin team.
The subbeskits on the trips this season played six times and included two wins, draws and failures Natomiast Stomil felt very well on his site – at the stadium at the al. Piłsudski 69a team Piotr Zaączkowski won three times and once lost.
In total, in ten rounds, the enthusiastic gathered 17 points and are in the head of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game, it was not pronounced.
“Every change takes time for results,” explains Peter Skiba.
“And we finally got too busy, and we believed in each other, but we can work in normal conditions.
We were just focusing on playing ball.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training bar."
On Tuesday, the Stomila footballers eliminated the Polish Chorz movements, but they needed to do it with a series of criminal throws.
In the south of Poland, Peter Skiba, Grzegorz Lech, and Janusz Bucholc, because the trainer Zackzkowski had to rest these key players before the Saturday fight with Podbeskid.
In Chorzow, however, he played the returning injuries of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-standing goal.
"It's always cool to get the goal, and I'm still in such a moment that we can continue to play in the canchars (Mosakowski equaled to 3:3 in 119 minutes - red.).
My dad used to cut me up and laugh, and I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he didn't expect."
Now Mosakowski counts on returning to the basic composition, the more that because of the yellow cards, he can't play the Ołeh Tarasenko.
"That's why I'm working hard on training so that I can play the first composition," says Mosakowski.
“I did everything in Chorzów to present myself as best as possible.
However, whether I'm going to play or sit on the reserve bench, I'm going to support the team as much as I can.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the Subbeskad game.
I'm sure we're going to have a hard meeting where the victory will have to run out, climb and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remisz may yet play, who has also suffered an injuries recently, so if he asks, we will only find out on Saturday, the more that Coach Zajączkowski traditionally seeks to keep his secret until the end of the case.
A man raped and murdered his nephew
“ You will never see the light of the day.
You will never breathe with fresh air again," Judge Kevin K. Allen said, referring to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
5-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple pointed out the place to hide the body.
"How could someone do this to his own nephew?" he asked Diey Smith, uncle of the girl.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," said Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same," a devastated woman added.
As Fox News says, the 22-year-old Whipple did not show any emotions during the interrogation.
Last month he admitted he kidnapped, sexually exploited and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said that his client was raised in a “perfect family.”
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to punish.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will hand over nearly $100 million additional resources to the communities affected by drought.
The programme providing money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of allowances for farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million for the support initiative for the affected drought communities, so that the eligible aid for the farm can receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local governmental areas under the Programme of Help to the affected drought communities will receive up to 1 million dollars of infrastructure grants and help to cope with the consequences of disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than 7 billion dollars for the government to fight drought.

Zdrajds of Chinese (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)
documentary film: In China in the last decade the number of divorces has increased twice.
The cause of this situation was generally a third party.
More and more men maintain non-married relationships, which have resulted in the education of a particular industry in this country – professional lovers who are trying to save the marriage of betrayed wives.
Let's scan out loud: Ma-teusz!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister in Silesian Piekary
A personal general trial was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Śląskie Piekary.
"Dear ladies, louder, louder, so we will not welcome your Prime Minister here!
Let us scand out loud: Ma-teusz!", he encouraged the leaders.
Unfortunately, the efforts of an enthusiastic voyage did not bring the expected result.
The electoral campaign is ongoing.
Politicians drive all over the country by persuading voters to themselves.
An intense campaign also runs the Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is the leader of the Silesian list of PiS is a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting is scheduled precisely, including appropriate repairs.
It was, or rather, supposed to be, in Silesian Bakers.
A special guest should be welcomed specifically.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, the head office decided to conduct a general trial.
Like a digestive bead, he was trying to encourage the crowd to scan the name of the government's boss.
“It will not be welcome to me, but to your Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
So louder, louder my dears!" he encouraged the thrilled.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not fully kidnap the hot leads and reluctantly responded to the "Ma-teusz", but the recording of an enthusiastic pipeline makes a van on the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man sentenced to murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of Stephen and Katie Stay murder in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stays' house on 9 July 2014, demanding that his wife, Melannie Haskell, was separated with.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7 died when Haskell opened fire, as Haskell said.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed she was severely wounded, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskella's defense on the basis of indifference.
The jury will be reunited on Monday to issue a sentence.
Quantum Internet getting closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the American army's research are moving the quantum internet by a step closer.
Such an Internet could offer military options for security, detection and accuracy of time not available in the traditional approach to networking.
The centre for the Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of Opportunities of the US Army Walk, looked at the researchers from the University of Insbruck, which managed to achieve a record transfer of the confusion state between matrix and light – 50 kilometers away with the use of fibre cables.
The confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums like cubit.
When two cubits are mixed and measured by one of them, this will have an impact on the measurements made on the other, even if the second cubit is physically distant.
"The [50 km] is two rows more than it was possible before, and this is a real distance to the start of the construction of intermilitary quantum networks" - said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, which was published in the Nature magazine, the Quantum Information section.
The quantum intermittent networks would consist of distant nodes of physical chains of coubits that are confiscated together despite a large physical distance.
Researchers found that this dispersion of the confiscated state is essential for the creation of a quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a big step forward to achieve a dissolved state of large scale," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-governing military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the state in the second end is also high after the fibre passage to meet some of the requirements of several of the most difficult quantum networks.
The research team began an experiment from the calcium atom trapped in a ion trap.
Using laser binders, researchers have entered a quantum state in the ion, at the same time encouraging it to emulate the photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, quantum states of atom and particles of light have been confiscated.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fibre cable.
"The film emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometres and is rapidly absorbed by the light" - said Lanyon.
Therefore, his team initially sent a part of the light through a non-linear crystal illuminated with a strong laser radius.
The length of the photon wave has been converted to the optimal value from the point of view of transmission to high distances – the current standard telecommunication wavelength is 1550 nanometres.
Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-km fibre cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and particles of the light were still confined even after the wavelength transformation and passing through the distance.
"Decision on the choice of calcium means that this result sets out a direct path for the creation of a confined network of atomic clocks at high physical distances, as calcium can be combined with a high-quality “game”.
The army is very much interested in the combined clock networks built on a large scale due to the application of the precise position, precise time navigation and sync" - said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, military researcher, who also co-governs the program.
