At the emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend.
During the call on the emergency line with the shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it is necessary for them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that the contacts on the family of the dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police, Amy Prentiss found the body and a hand-written report on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said the letter that the authorities signed Lamb.
There was no suspect that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to school campus, where the police believed he shot a favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
I hear Lamb made a fatal call on an emergency line shortly later.
In the end, there was another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school, students and the faculty forced them to hide behind the locked doors, the entrusted authorities are still trying to explore the motivation of Lamb.
The details published by the investigators on the side of the state and the students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record of a criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb himself in the book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared the academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with the other 17 members of the faculty and many students attended courses in both at once.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shattered, "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons where he said he had a problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of the university meant that the doctorate that Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
President William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb probably had something to worry about."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police caught his trail crossing the Arkansas state border back to Misissippi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb was killed by a single gun shot in the yard of a house, about a mile from his parents in Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the Washington State Coroner, Methel Johnson.
He left the car started on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started working at a university with 3500 students in a city, which counts about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
In spring he got a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's long-term friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older kid who taught her to play guitar for years.
He was a pretty heartbeat at the time.
The hearts of all the girls sniffed as soon as he showed up," says Hairston, which is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency phone call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that is adjacent to the Gautier River's shoulder.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband, Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, which is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She was with my mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter, Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when Abigail and I graduated at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a well-lighted bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss at the night of September 5th, sweat what Lamb played on guitar and harmonic for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to play and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boy student club and the government of students.
In Delta State campus in Cleveland about Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, took part in reminder events with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the vigilia during which the university congregation became "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was designed to reflect the fact that the police now claimed that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were really cut off.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us declares that they won't take so many seasonal workers like last year, but manufacturers of toys and products claim to give current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, which is a decline compared to the previous 45,000 season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting tenderers this month, and the staff will be recruited during October until December.
While holidays alone are months away, shopping holiday season is coming and companies are preparing to take temporary staff to help in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre and waited for the king's family to come, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana would sit there," said in the trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The movie begins, and I realize I'm in the reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Returning in time," is a document on "Return to the Future", which presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and also director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is really the best travel document that has ever been filmed."
"Back in time" will be available to the VOD, DVD and the selected cinemas in October.
The UN Chief says there's no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to the Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that "There is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years and more weapons will only deteriorate violence and suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations has again urgently called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and promote an inclusive approach to finding a political solution.
Ban said at the central press conference that he was planning to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five Permanent Councils of the countries - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the border of the Ministerial General Assembly at the end of this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regrets that divisions in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "have done this inevitable."
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity, which they have shown in achieving Iran's nuclear agreement in the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to call him a person who often changes his mind.
The others above the shoulder hands like a misguided joke.
And some are getting ready for implosion.
But let some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the elections, they can't do it (for now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a dual number, and some people start asking seriously what this means for the nomination chances of this magnate from the area of real estate.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made a path to the rise of Herman Cain, eventually none of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could attack in general elections.
But external groups like Super PAC Jeba Jeba Bushe and the economic conservative group Club for Growth realize the Trump's will to last and start paying their dollars to stand to put it down.
Here are some recent vote numbers suggesting that real estate magnate is not just a mitigating phase:
Trump's favourability assessment turned by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidature in mid-June, the vote of Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid- July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable view of Donald Trump.
At least three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held at initial stages.
After the vote of the University of Quinnipiac last week, 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans claimed that they would either be "satisfactory" or "satisfactory" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they'd be "reasoned" from his candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enhanced" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters claim to be "satisfied" or "distorted" if Jeb Bush had become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been criticized widely for his inflammation and insulting, 52 percent of the Republican voters have been nationally inclined to the idea that the real estate has a magnate of the right temperament for the post of the President, according to the Monday vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senator Club of the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of the Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temperament is not part of the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican voters get used to this idea.
When he wears his student hats, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question that most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from the late July, when four out of 10 put their money on Jeba Bushe.
Full publication: Voliči GOP had not in the past the brightest crystal ball.
This time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a candidate against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump also beats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump, while anti-Trumponese support is diudically spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates Trump will almost always receive the majority support.
He leads 13 points over Carly Fiorina, Marc Rubiem by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christi, about 33 points for everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that beats him?
Ben Carson would lead a wide-ranging 19-point trader in a hypothetical match against one.
The hollow majority of Donald Trump's followers say they've already made their own opinion.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump's voters claim to change their opinion.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent indicates that they keep an open back door for a change between candidates.
Yet, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider neurochirurger Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called the immigrants from Mexico "violents" in the announcement speech of his campaign with immigration still held as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's nabbornness will unleash the key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and damage to rebranding.
But according to the new Monday public opinion survey ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the theme of immigration remains in the radius of reflectors, Donald Trump will remain.
The government frustration is reaching the new maxim.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive about half of the support from the Republican voters today, especially due to their state of outsiders.
Six out of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post claims that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
Voting Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "satisfactory" and 21 percent of "heavy angry."
The House supported a greater proportion of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will get more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Appeal in the first reading supported the government's novel of the upper law, which adjusts the amount of the yield of brown coal surface mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) has promised Members that they will receive extra money both the Treasury and the municipal budgets.
They criticized opposition members who feared that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they did so far as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government's novel of the upper law, which, in addition, means that the State should receive more of the revenue from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The share of the State shall be increased to 67 percent while the share of the municipalities will be reduced from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The table also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals that companies benefit from.
The change in mineral mining fees is intended to bring CZK 427 million to the State Treasury more than in 2013.
The income of municipal budgets is expected to have a neutral effect by the government, as the fee is to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipalities received about CZK 450 million and the government budget of CZK 150 million.
From the mining of brown coal, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns came from the municipalities.
The novel is also calculated by increasing the payout from the residual area with a permitted mining of 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
The collection of these remuneration is to remain fully part of the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the villages will receive CZK 14 million per year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but the government shall establish it by its regulation.
The refund shall be calculated as the result of the quantities of mineral extracted and the rates for each species of minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation is the reason for a change, among other things.
The ODS Marek Benda alerted, however, that setting the fee of the government's regulation does not have to be in conformity with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Młodka, in this case, it is not a tax because the State pays inefficiency which is a sovereign property.
Only municipalities whose territory are affected by mining shall receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of money will get the state.
The same ratio will be in case of radioactive mining.
The part of the money that is on the mining fees will be assigned to purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to remedy damage after mining or in order to provide a rescue service.
The above criticized opposition Members who claimed in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostes) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they did so far as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget by the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (East) elected in the Ústecké kraj.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, Ms KSČM Hana Aulická warned.
Kadner and Aulická failed to propose to reject the novel, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The reasoning report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in coal prices is not expected because prices are more than 90 percent long-termly contracted.
The main consumers as power plants or heat plants should therefore not increase prices.
"But on the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will increase their remuneration will compensate for the efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mainly mean the reduction of employees," admits the government.
However, it believes that the increase in employment fees is abundant.
According to the rapporteur, the amendment of Milan Urban (ČSSD) is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If the coal is profitable for the limits, then it will have the impact on the revenues for both the country and the villages, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
It believes that the limits at the bottom of the ČSA should already be broken for social, national and economic reasons due to the long-term stability of domestic energy.
The happy will guide Bohemia as one, the deployment affects the weather.
All four Czech tennis will appear at the quarterly draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans that, given the difficult conditions, he will spread the load to the whole quartet.
In Delhi, the heat and high humidity of the air are waiting for challenging fights that can stretch for up to five hundred.
We have to take this into account.
I'd like to clear it up by the weather.
And according to what it would look like, Navrátil said during today's Czech selection training in the center of Lubže Kumára Khánny.
With the team's number one and the world's 40 of Jiří Veselý counts to both Friday and Sunday.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably in position two.
I'd like almost everyone to be involved.
I've got it in my head a little bit, but I'm not going to say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech assembly should be Štěpánko's participation in Saturday four.
It's just a question that will stand next to the dossier that has a cup in Davis' fourth balance at 18:4.
It probably won't be happy.
There are options left with Rosole or Adam Paulas.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," said Navrátil.
It will decide according to the development of the two games.
The variance may be Paulasek, with the Vesel's surprising in the first round in the deblue over Australia.
"He's decent," said Navrátil.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown there since the other hundred.
"I'm happy for these experiences, and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The home will put in the two games of Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated the players of the third and fourth hundred ladder.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both challengers and ours have experiences in the ATP Tour, but many times we've convinced that the Davis Cup ladders don't decide.
"He decides the momental form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening two games start at 6:30 PEOPLE and can be drawn for the weather.
According to prediction, he's supposed to rain, and the jacket's not under the roof.
However, it may be for artificial lighting.
They've already fired it and it's got about 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been very excited to expect.
Jeremy Corbyn's new working manager will have his debut at the Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he'll have to cooperate with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will put the first of his six questions asked shortly after the fall, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the Members.
In a weekly expression, he asked for a "mean of theater and more facts."
He also said that he could skip several sessions that he would leave for his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, coming to the shadow cabinet and its Tuesday speech to the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the labourist leader to become silent during the singing of the national anthem on the service on Tuesday to the opportunity of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a series of conservative Members and is the center of attention of several stories on the title pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing a national anthem brought attention to himself
The spokesman, Mr. Corbyn, said he was going to be in honorable silence, and he'd recognize the "herendship of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's Newsnight program that the worker's leader would recommend the national anthem to sing "no matter" in his belief that the monarchy should be cancelled.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve Mr Corbyn's top team, quoted differentiations in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "confronted" after Mr Corbyn has been appointed through his position in the European Union and the governmental limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Working Party submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of doses.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party "very clearly" offered government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Working Party, whom David Cameron has faced in the last decade of his election as the leader of the conservatives.
The leader of the Working Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the crowd" for Mr Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontative and that both "shooting responses" and "shooting trade", and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow of business secrets, will represent him on PMQ if he does not attend — for example when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea that he would let other colleagues step out on him from time to time, because he had heard that he had discussed the whole matter with the House spokesman John Bercowe.
When Mr Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to turn himself away from the style of "Punch and Judy", which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted that he failed.
Since their first transmission in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barometer of the judgment of the leaders, their management of the House and their attitude between the other MPs, although critics argued that they were caricatured and needed far-reforms.

The pounds are rising while salaries in Great Britain accelerates
The pound jumped on the following dates and showed the recovery of British wage growth while FTSE 100 was conducted above by the SABMiller tender objective.
Between May and June GB profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest thing since 2009, and it seemed like the estimates are approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling increased by 1% to $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 closed the index to 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional share on the market and jumped by 20% after he got a closer bid from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two biggest brewery in the world, and the approaches of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% above after encouraging reports from the Richemont rival group of luxury goods.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining gigant said that they increased about $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The shares in the packages and the Mondi paper group were the largest fall on the index and dropped by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to the company's "sale."
JD Sports grew by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jump in mid-years before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
The Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "the greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it's unlikely that the buyer's power would prevail higher wage costs in his company, says.
Costs could hit JD Sports enlargement plans, added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opposers of the Prague apartments of marshmallow shout.
Controversial construction has been traced.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the cancellation of the decision unlawful and will appeal against him.
Against the construction, which is to be found close to the Anesian monastery in the centre of Prague, protested in front of the Prague office of 1 hundred people, there were petitions.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that there was a violation of the construction law because all the territorial decisions were not respected.
"The underlying territorial decision does not include, for example, some of the land, distances from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clearly and clearly described the shape of the building, the definition of the territory concerned with the influence of the construction," is written in its decision.
The unlawful magistrate also considers that some of the grounds for decisions have been issued to the originally discussed documentation, but have changed.
For example, it is the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be found on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor has no valid consent.
However, the land owner has only submitted consent to the project documentation for territorial proceedings, not to agree on the location of the building on its premises, writes the Department of Construction Order.
According to Francesca August Razetto, the Department of Investigation did not notify the decision of the supervisory authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the period for the initiation of the review has expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"This project we have been preparing for 17 years, respecting all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto in the press report.
The project, which people, because of the allegedly proposed facade color, call the marshmelon, raises strong emotions in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people met in the past for a protest against the construction.
The association and the inhabitants of the close houses bother that some permits were issued for a house that was supposed to look different many years ago.
They also criticise the inappropriate construction for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anesian monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted with the glass facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Institute of Memorials (NÚ) and repealed the authorisation of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows but the NPÚ and the Magistrates approved and on this basis were issued a construction permit.
The author of the proposal rejects opposers, said he never counted with the facade in a pink color that gave the project a nickname after pink white sugar.
The Czech politician took the migrants.
The wanders put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian assistance to refugees.
On the way, he took three Syrian refugees to the car with the crew who said they wanted to drive about half a mile.
According to him, it was not criminal yet in Hungary, claimed to the human newspapers.
We knew that the guardians of the law would not do such a thing.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested to our surprise and transferred to Szeged investigation, he described the letter.
Lastly, he spent nine hours in a policy cell.
The police said they behaved properly, but they were in charge of communication, because they didn't speak very well English.
However, prison was tristic, according to him.
For example, in our cell, about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were struggling.
There was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people have been locked up for the second day, and because of the barrier, none of them had any idea what to do with them, Berg said.
What can't he take away from you?

Metcash launches a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's replacement in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of over 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joined with brands such as Dunsborough based on the ice creamer Simmo's offering tastes in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football league to local customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the seller of food, alcohol and hardware celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
It is at stake a lot because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generates a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA trades enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will count on 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first trades that took over the sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retailer could lose $ 360 million at the annual sale and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South Australia and 30 in the west over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million on income prior to taxation, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the Eastern States, especially against Aldi and Coles, although the last survey Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were the most loyal ones.
Morgan Stanley thinks that the food sales of Metcash will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "very likely disappear during decades.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass's comment.
But it's known that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglasse last week.
The IGA market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the metchash food trade earnings, which adds about 1200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale trade has gone into counter-attack and invested more than USD 150 million per year to compare counterpart prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus help IGA retailers re-equip the stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privates.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the pricing and reconciliation programmes will catch a fall and hope that large sale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time for four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side-effect in recent miscarriages around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented dua, often called "Special Ks," took an unfair attention to himself thanks to the aphera with unfairly known Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualification game in Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by the arbitrator, Harrison then said, "Wawrinka had one to pull Kyrgios and I should have drawn him too."
While he was last seen destroying the missile after the cramp defused Richard Gasquet's possible deficiencies on the US Open, Kokkkinakise was unwillingly defending Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where Sam Grothem is fighting about the location in the second twoh behind Bernard Romic in the semifinal Davis Cupu against Britain.
"I was thinking intensely that in my opinion, Thanasi was a little overwhelmed," says Healy.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of the cramps in the US, but he's not the first player who would kill himself for frustration on his rocket. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say he's not proud of this event.
But he was really well controlled because in the US he was exposed to very provocative circumstances for Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, working very hard, and he fits great and so further, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the wardrobe, he trains hard, he's in a wonderful condition, it's very stable and mature young boy, and I just think he deserves to be judged by his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of the important match that begins on Friday, and states that "excellent decision" is the right solution for all, but it supports the Canberry native to return to the team as a longstand.
"Early we want our team to be completely focused on the fight, not on all the controversy that was around him [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think that Nick stood up very quickly as Federer, Murray and other people pointed out, in the public's eyes quickly, he also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the critics he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the outline, when he can think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and holds migrants
After notification of the state of threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted to cross her illegal crossing to stop the tide of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country no one and the Serbian authority reacted disrupted.
Those who have been arrested for the unknown time on the land's belts between two states stand by those who run away from violence in the native countries build tents and dwell.
But there's feelings of frustration.
When the helicopter flies over them, the migrants call together "Open the borders!" and broadcast order units to the Hungarian police.
Some deny food and water for the protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to allow refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) He wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect injury.
In the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The disturbances on the Hungarian-Serbia border came the day after the 28-state block did not come up with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people looking for protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hopes of reaching an eventual agreement for another month or the end of the year that EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special EU European Summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn its hope on Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the threat situation in two southern regions gave authors the greater authority to address the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up the asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a fence from the melted wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to draw the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of which have escaped from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are going for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, which is a view that clearly differs from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the infringement of the 4 meter fence that the government had built on the south border with Serbia, and also set longer periods in prison for those who illegally transfer.
"Thanks of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of threat," said the spokesman of the Government Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Szeged.
In this we are very clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must continue to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters have been watching heavyly armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorga Bakondi, the Advisor of Orbana for Home Defense, said that the authority caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 were already caught in the territory of the State.
They penetrated through the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under new laws.
The authorities quickly fixed the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two out of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a trawl covered with a rigid wire.
At the main border crossing of Roszke, there was chaos, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and created a crowd pusher.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main motorway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Election 2016: Náskok Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders decreased by half in the national vote
Former Minister of Foreign Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-cipher lead in a Democratic nomination race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is driving its lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary voters (decreased from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is to report whether he wants to become president, has received support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of main competition, the most dramatic voters say it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that the candidates will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton lost the ground under her feet in several demographic groups while Sanders gained several.
Clinton keeps a great lead between women and relieves, but her leadership is narrowing down.
Her support between men decreased significantly, and Sanders only loses 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with the democratic voters under 50 years has disappeared and now Sanders and they're equal.
Clinton's still in charge of older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-cipher lead in front of Sanders between the liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in all states say that she would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was a party candidate.
The quarter would support it with certain reservations, and the next 15 percent would only support it for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I don't think it's a surprise that Clinton's contemporaries are present because of her particularly inflammation.
Views are mixed between those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that it would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When the Clintons are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the time that she was the president of the woman (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's favours also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a large possibility of choosing and consensus on problems.
While the vice president is considering the potential candidate for the president, 57 percent of the democratic primary voters would like to be faced - again, the third thinks that he should not be running.
When primary democratic voters were asked whom they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden as their second choice, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, the leader of Hillary Clinton will spread from 20 points when Biden will run, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; however, this number fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second in this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be selective is increasing.
However, when the question of the candidate has been more important, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, neither a democratic candidate or a potential candidate does act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and credible and think they have strong leadership quality.
Biden of all three leads in honesty while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters don't think Clinton's honest and trustworthy, that is twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent doesn't think of him.
Prime democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are consistent with their ideological view.
With regard to all these standards, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision on the use of her personal email and the server as a state secret continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation of this matter and they say that their overall view did not affect it at all.
But it's a whole different story between the American public.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with its explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were divided in March, shortly after this problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no influence on their overall opinion on Clinton, while in 36 percent their opinion on Clinton has been deteriorated.
It is mainly the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claims their opinion on Clinton has been deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and credible among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent sees her as honest and credible, which is a decline of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country can't see Trump as honest and credible.
But Clinton and Trump have good signs as leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush did their best in honor.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't think of him.
The error gap in sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percent.
Ben Carson ended up after Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey and others are allowed to seek support.
The voters from a number of Republicans across the country continue to support Trumpa by a vicious majority, and came out of 23% of the support in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The research also found that Carson is conducting well across the demographic groups, and he excludes Trumpa among the university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carla Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio State John Kasiche, is behind the visconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the run from 10% aid to current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansasu Mike Huckabee and Florid Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error margin in sample 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of support between the Republicans for Trump 32%.
The latest survey from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
At the uprising trend of Carsona, Trump decided to shoot blind on a neurosurgeon in service, and even Carson apologized for an interview about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood were accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading brotherhood ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge against five people was filed.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Denga during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and the lates took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, announced the police.
The police say he had his eyes tied, he had a bag full of sand of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen fields.
Mr. Deng finally complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Psi didn't call 911 after Deng passed out, and they allegedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, said the police.
However, they found time to change Dengo's dress, googlise his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, and ask him about the council, said police chief Chris Vagner at the press conference.
"In this moment, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to revive and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a tummy object in the head, a corpse and thighs.
"For too many families have been devastated as a result of brotherhood abuse and at least one student dies every year for overload since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengo family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The grand jury, Monroe County, recommended a third-grade murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other brotherhood members, including Mr. Meng, will also be accused of assaulting over harassment and crime.
"We want to hold not only interested persons, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also get them responsible," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College has banned brotherhood and national brotherhood has abolished its relationship with local branches.
This will be the tents when the Fed increases interest rates
The growth of the rates will come and the bull market will collapse, the returns of bonds will rise and the economy will slip into the recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy, in particular, it offers the history of a small source of timing.
The recese came 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve System is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why the officials of the American Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rates will start, but rather the trajectory as long as normalisation takes.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, at the end, market members may make sure that all the troubles due to speed increases can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in Feda since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'lift money'," said Julian Jessop, the head of the global economy of Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last month, the expected increase in rates can make air a little unstable.
But as soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for recession of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may be reflected again by the change in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank in the recent study on what will happen after Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market in the past approximately 35 years often - about 14 percent - aims to increase the rates in relatively flat in 250 days (primary increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns back to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main share strategia of Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and returns are beginning to decline.
Recese is a real economic life, but the increase in rates often help her.
At the present time, the Fed is facing certain conditions that have not yet existed and which could accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history at increasing Feda rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal annual increase in GDP was below 4.5 percent during 118 increases in rates since 1950.
Although, in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, a few expect him to hold, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, Atlanta Fed states.
The increase in rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question might arise, "the time is different," said Deutsche.
The market participants were prepared to grow Fed all year long and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trade indicates only 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all increasing cycles have been so far in the super cycle of increasing the pák effect with GDP covering the beginning of the recession very quickly after starting recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far from the longest of those that the Fed had waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we continue.
The strong return was also volatile, as the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is quite similar to what shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more evident in bonds than in shares when the Fed changes policy directions.
For bonds, revenues appear to change the direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/lower cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing the returns of bonds fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The Strateg Charles Schwab believes that the increase in rates will cause the returns between long- and short-dated bonds to be equal to the curve.
The high yield debts often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about the turnover," said Kathy Jones, a firm analyst of the fixed pension in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapted by Feda's expectations.
"With the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
The short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is platformier, the credit margin expanded and volatility increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens the policy.
In general, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win after the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
The multinational companies with a lot of debt will be doing worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that "quality" shares tends to overcome within three months of initial increase in rates," said the analyst Goldman Sachsve in the customer report.
The firms with strong balance sheets preceded weak balance sheet companies at any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility stocks, have also exceeded their lower quality counterparties by 4 (procent points), respectively 3 (procent points).
The debt will become a big problem.
The high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
Spokes can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claimed by Ms Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "hlunning"
He thinks he's getting more unrecognizable than his commercial rival
He's also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
Possibly colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not a original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" in Classic FM, claimed by the leading Member and accumulated fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they are doing something that does not do commercial broadcasts.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the bosses of BBC that the public service radio station appears to be "hlugged" and is increasingly unrecognizable than its business opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "hlugged" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I think, when you actually just imitate what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC has rejected the allegation that BBC Radio 3 is far from its business opponent in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classic music on Radia 3 would never learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live by music and creating music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radia 3 to find new music and to put new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the regulator of the BBC Radia 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated with regard to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that got fired because of the foot hooking to business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and reached the Commission's hearing.
Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as unorthodox and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the show BBC1 - in which the stars of Paloma Faith andBoy George as judges - were made "the custom of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporation to find a hit from his own stables next time he starts a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude orders of more future series of The Voice series or spending money on license fees for other fun formats.
Internet sales grow at the slowest pace since August and the guilt can be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the 2000 census itself.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for stopping spending
For over decades, virtual shopping was up and thanks to it, many British major streets became the city of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of stopping online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth from the beginnings of the year 2000, with only 5 percent increases compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of stopping online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth in the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers began to use their mobile phones to carry out purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to realise purchases in various contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) stagnates somewhat, and therefore it seems to pass away.
The Black Friday Phenomene, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could stop shopping from this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
In the last year, five times more than the average of the buyers turned to his computers to arrange purchases and match several websites of the sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers recontract, can hold customers from other purchases
Research published by British Retail Consortium found that only £1 from each £5 was lost online.
For certain products such as TV and washing machines, more than one third of the sales is made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
The Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the Bin Laden's family was sanctioned
Body 29 of the dead was transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly throws guilt for the collapse of the design magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane broke.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The victims were carried by the street.
They dressed in a certain degree in white, grieving chose their way and gave respect to the victims when the first of the fallen came to his last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad news was passing around the sacred place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had crossed the ceiling of the mosque and cast himself into the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral and the Saudi King sanctioned the building group of the family bin Ladina over the catastrophe that also left 394 injured.
Body 29 dead after the fall of the crane in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by streets
Among the dead was the father of four Qasim Akram children from Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane broke down.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual pilgrimage of a snake.
The Saudi officials have already promised that the snake to Mecca would take place and thousands of people continue to descending into the city.
King Salman today said that Binadin Group should not leave the crane's shoulder up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the Decree, carried by the State operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of fall.
The English Disc Agency has not reported this detail, but has stated that the heads of the company have been banned from traveling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims overwhelmed before the snake pilgrimage later in this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any statement of collapse of the crane and have not been submitted to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Declarations also accused the group of non-application of the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Tens of cranes surrounded by Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort in the head of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been near the Saudi Arab ruler family for decades and operated large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Káida Osáma bin Laden was the son of a loser, whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
Havaria has become in the middle of a strong wind and rain only a few days before a million people in the kingdom have been hit on a pilgrimage, which must at least once in life take every good Muslim.
Officials say that 158 people are still staying in the hospital.
The officials have determined that one million riyal will be devoted to the relatives of the killed and the same amount for the permanent injured.

Head of B&Q claims that Eastern Europe traders working cheaply with trend
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, claiming Veronique Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the point of growth
The result is 200 Screwfix business-oriented shops
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
He worked Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for Daily Mail
The British say they postpone the hammers and puppies and pass them on to employed Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a painter, it seems you're in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do their work at home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laura, a new Executive Director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix trade-oriented shops, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laura claims that she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions make better catches.
At present, most men's workers are male sex.
She said that there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more women's households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still have men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In essence, half our customers are women who make 80% decisions about the purchase of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of the only five women at the command of the leading companies according to the British index FTSE100, also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between men and women's directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in his half-representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Mrs. Laura says: "It was an conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find a good woman we would take to us.
Kingfisher announced a fall in profit in the mid-year and sales after the group took the costs of closing the shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend owned by Screwfix and B&Q is to open 200 new shops
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is at risk.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of dedication.
The ODS Chairman Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the disposable contribution sounds good, but it would be better for a long time to be in standard valorisation, as it would be projected for the next years.
"We have the space to find the mechanism we'll arrange for it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was intended to valorise beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy with the argument that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she believed is not pink.
The higher valorisation next year would mean the budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns and the Ministers debate every hundredth of them.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorisation decreased.
Reporter Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal did not resolve the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
In this right payout in December, he makes a significant complicate and maybe even deterrent, he said.
The Chairman of Members of ČSSD Roman Sklenák therefore proposed a shortening of the time limit for the committee to discuss the standard for 10 or 20 days, even the right-hands blocked it.
The committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be total to 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should grow on average about a slope.
The benefit should be made according to the pension novel of people who will be entitled to pensions in December or part of it.
Even those who disappeared in December could receive him the right to retire before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
The revenues are regularly valorised in the Czech Republic to January, with a view to price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year corresponds to the pension of 41.5 percent of gross wages, it should be 40.5 percent.
On old-age pensions, the state spent last year according to the state final account of CZK 314,7 billion, which was about five billion more annually.
The expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 percent of all budgetary expenditure and 46 percent of all expenditure required by the law.
The average full retirement last year increased by 104 to 10.714 crowns in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Management has provided a payment of 2.4 million full of old-age pensions and about 17,000 relative pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned the political career plans, he will focus on science.
The senate chair had a billionaire according to the Russian media almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the western Kaliningrad region whose governor Nikolai Cukanov as the candidate of the Government Party of Single Russia in Sunday elections with an overview defense.
According to the Russian laws, senators do not vote citizens, but they are chosen by the governor from the trinity of candidates whose names shall be notified before the governor's elections.
After the election, the Senator will choose from three candidates himself.
The complication was for Jake's fact that he lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as the law demands.
Although the Kreml for Jakunina found an exception with the fact that he is an exceptional and empowered ambassador who does not apply to the legal requirement of a long-term stay.
The filming of the Czech Theory Tiger comedy is over.
The last drop in the purpose of the prime hero is the voluntary death of his father, who has reached strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžur was deciding about her grandfather's life, the age and the funeral.
John is clear that she is on a similar path with her wife Olgou - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live dignifiedly and freely again.
He desires to regain the government over his life, and as a solution chooses to escape from the past, he said to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be for Bartoš, with whom he had already worked on the Invisible series.
Yet, he was surprised by an actor who appeared in front of a camera after a longer break associated with reconvalescence after a serious disease.
We had a deal three years ago.
I let him read the script, and he said he likes how sad he is.
And I'm surprised he's probably a busy athlete.
He used to ask where he was going to sit before he was filming another scene.
This time, he was riding a bike, climbing around the rocks and even going to the hill.
And the whole thing in the record tropical treads, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women are marrying a tiger to make him a rabbit in time.
They're gonna smash him some feed, but they're gonna close the door, so he can't happen to play a tiger out of the rabbit.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, commenting on the actor.
His wife, who may act slightly negative to the audience, made Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a janitor, and she wants to bail her husband to death, and she's admired Bajgar.
The film is parallel to the fate of the John's daughters of Olinka and Alenky - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, koproducenty Czech TV and Rozhlas and TV Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Google Internet company promised to provide more to $5.5 million ($32.6 million) to organisations helping thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charitable deposition of this internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled the part of Teličkovi’s visit for the criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the movement ANO Pavel Telička has postponed a quarterly trip to Baku because the Arbairian authorities have cancelled an official part of his visit today.
According to Telka, Baku justifies the resolution of the EP last week, which criticizes the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and which Telička was a co-author.
By decision of the Arbairian Party Telička lost the possibility of interviewing official partners, as well as visiting political prisoners, which depended on the agreement of the authorities, explained in the press statement of his Brussels office.
The path, which was planned for several months in advance, wanted Telička to use to meet the leadership of the Parliament and the representatives of the executist and with the representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the Czech Republic.
The resolution of the EP condemns "unseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on the European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officers and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment on the barberian opposition journalist Chadídža Ismail, which was committed to exploring corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that in Syria he builds his air base.
Bogdanovskij did not exclude in the visit of Novosibirsk that the Russian air base in Syria will be established in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing's excluded, he said.
Russia has already a flight maritime base in Syria in Tartus port, which has used rather as a service and logistics centre.
According to the Russian press reports, from the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weapons and military material to Syria has risen.
According to Moscow, they are armed consignments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are going to set up an air base in Lataquia, which remains the bassus of Syrian President Bashar Asada for now.
However, Washington does not have a full clarity on the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, agreeing with American commentators.
The US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third phone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah will go to Moscow to interpret anxiety about the collection of Russian arsenal near Israel.
Speaker of the White House Josh Earnest named Asada's support from Moscow for a loss bet.
The aims of Russia's policy in Syria said they were rather unclear.
He thinks Moscow made Syria a satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a rather long-term target, but what, it is not entirely clear according to Earnest.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation of Russian press, should be the main topic of Putin's speech at the coming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
The situation in the Ukrainian Donbas says, on the contrary, the Russian leader is not even speaking.
According to today's report, the New York Times government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and Russian president could meet during the UN meeting.
But they say the opinions between the White House's counselors are breaking up so far.
The TASS agency today appealed to the words of the Cremel spokesman Dmitri Peskov wrote that Putin had not yet been able to meet Obama on his New York stay.
Put the sesame oil on the yellow diet, the canopy helps strengthen the immunity.
The good way to increase the supply of well-being of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from seeds for cold, all healthy substances will remain in oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as guts.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for preventing cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the Czech Republic has been the most frequent reason for the death of Bohemia for several years.
Yellow inflammation suffers mainly from women, helping sesame oil.
If you are among Asian cuisine lovers, you must not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of food and has a number of favourable health effects.
It is often used in a yellow diet.
Essential fatty acids that contain are good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer 3 times more often than men.
Generally, the problems with the gallbladder are particularly related to those with overweight who do not export and consume many animal fats.
The sesame oil can be used with success even in the liver diet, which is very similar to the glitter.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that brings consumption of this oil, they should be careful of the exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use re-seeded seeds that have a more significant taste.
However, oil is lost by all active substances, described by Ladislav Hačcký, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Olej of Kraslic in Sokolov, which produces bio virgin oils licked for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses solely unsafe seeds of white seeds.
In an hour, our press will be able to clear 8 kilos of sesame.
Mechanical presses the raw material shall warm up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra dollar designation.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite of oils is sunflower.
From Jarmila Hamerska's research, which led to Masaryk University, it appeared that he prefers 43% of respondents in a hot kitchen.
However, it is in fact not suitable for frying, it is starting to overflame at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads and especially in a diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most reduce cholesterol levels from all fatty acids.
In heart problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories received.
For example, there is 62 calories in one spoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in a spoon of beet oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realise that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to touch extra dollar oils.
The sunflower lasts as much as sesame and canopy for nine months.
By storage in the fridge, durability is still prolonged.
Old oil people recognize especially according to the horny flavor.
On the contrary, he's not stuck at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
The oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical hemp are included in so-called superfood, and therefore the oil is considered to be the best of plant oils.
For this marking, they owe the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids can't make the body itself, and one must accept them from food.
It is particularly important to receive omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has demonstrated that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
The men in France and Greece will consume 0.6 grams of it, and the Islamics will take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
The oil is appropriate to include in the dining room as part of the support diet to strengthen immunity and to heal injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membrane.
People don't have to be afraid of the use of cannabis oil, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that it belongs to the most sold in Bohemia Oil.
He'll be sold 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon fast in the morning.
Konopi oil is not a tastefully distinctive, but greatly strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from Craslical Company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, Americans are the most disgusting nation of the barbecues.
There's 1.4 barbecue on one household.
Then there are various barbecue competitions around the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
Based on the consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that the only 4% of people in life were not grilling.
The complete majority then barbecue several times in a year.
In order to be successful barbecue, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adjust meat by marining a few hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is the most appropriate and at the same time leaves the health of good substance in the barbecue?
Generally, in the process of barbecue, it should be saved with fat.
Experts agree that a large portion of oils begins to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then lose the body of beneficial substances which we otherwise obtain in the consumption of oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
But it does not mean that extra virgin oils will not be found in barbecue.
Gross oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately extract the grape oil.
It is wonderful to add the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen is characterized by the unique properties of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, as one of the few oils, it preserves the health of the beneficial substance, describes the benefits of the dairy oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, which belongs to several Czech producers of this oil from wine vineyard.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linolic acid, and therefore it is effective in combating excessive cholesterol.
In grape oil our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help increase our external beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and fragile hair.
The chefs commend the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example in flavoring of salads, but also for the heat treatment of foods.
The barbecue can be used in two ways, in marining and grilling itself.
Marining meat and fish will preserve their juice.
When preparing marinadine, three components shall be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we deliver acidity with an apple vinegar and make meat soft.
The roots add the meat of taste and the oil preserves and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are marked by just a few drops to prepare food.
The same is true for barbecue.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this method of preparation.
This is particularly related to flax, cannabis and beet oil, which should not be warmed at all.
Before the barbecue itself, shake oil oil oil oil, so you prevent the burning of food.
The necessary part of the barbecue is also the preparation of the annexes.
The grilled meat and fish fits practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the hot summer salad.
You need: • 1 pcs of peaches • 1 volume of the hand • 1 cup of cut cucumbers • 1 cup of salad leaves • 3 spoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl to the mixture of salad leaves ripped in the glove, cut cucumbers and large cubes cut by peaches.
According to the flavor of oleath and opiate, you can also enjoy mild chili and soy sauce.
In the end, dip a few drops of grape oil.
For exceptional taste then you can salad with gently cut almonds.
Dispersed sclerosis: it doesn't matter only on medications, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Dispersed sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurology, physiotherapy, ergoterapeut, urologist, oftalmoologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, such as women with multiple sclerosis, they also need consultations if they decide to have a child, they also include social advice, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
However, this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient itself.
The more the disease will fight actively, the longer it can work and does not necessarily change the style of his life.
As doctors observe, the passivity of the patients releases the area for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular movements are proven to delay considerably the time when the sick people need some compensation aid, such as the stick.
The important thing is that patients and their surroundings do not undergo different myths, such as that the disease is automatically leading to ending in a wheelchair.
This is why the site has been created Give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz) which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person to care for a multiple sclerosis is neurology.
In multiple sclerosis, it has been said twice that the way the disease starts to treat earlier, the rather the doctor may affect something.
It's because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong yet.
The sooner we hit, the greater the hope that we can stop and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, most often addressing weaknesses in lower limbs or equilibrium disorders.
Diseases work according to their individual needs: maintaining the condition, improving walking, strengthening the pelvic bottom, reducing swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on particular patient difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, Prime Minister of the Clinics of Rehabilitation and Body Medicine of the Faculty of Hospital in Motole.
People with multiple sclerosis are suffering from the same disease, but it is a little different in everyone.
Rehabilitation can't stop, but it can always mitigate her symptoms.
However, motion activity also strengthens the immune condition of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that sick people check what they can do, and that strengthens their confidence.
"In the exercise, the endorphins are also spilled and man feels well after him," notes PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Clinic of the Rehabilitation Medicine Faculty of the Royal Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the lymph system responsible for emotions.
That's how we interfere with psychics and immune processes, and we stabilize, delivers.
"Sometimes, these patients have been so-called spared, we know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the preference of the Clinics of Rehabilitation and Body Medicine at the University of Motole.
The aim of physiotherapy is that you can stay as long as you can, including working classification.
Therefore, the physiotherapists cooperate with ergotapists to get each person compensatory aid to him sealed to peace.
Many patients also need care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a tough life situation.
When a serious disease comes into your life, most people will shake.
They're having shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a painful soul we have to go to someone, not try to kidnap everything on our own beds.
"I work with them to conclude that even with handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere would not fly airbuses.
Air production is synonymous of accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't produce and process immediately.
Yet, next to super accurate, computer controlled machining machines, besides composite formation autoclaves, you can hit something as common as a merunic furnaces.
In a drum that reminds a pot of sugar watts, the edges of the metal parts that just came out of the milling machine are washed in a bunch of kilns.
"No one has come to any better," smiling Ivan Dubský, CEO of the Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the premises in the Prague Letňanes manufactures the former flight full door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world are delivering doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors of which part is compiled in Prague also enter the first and higher classes on the top of the largest airplane in the world Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the main motto.
Maybe the moment key lets the company organize twice a year.
If there is no record of control on the yellow sticker, they should be able to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who are driving regularly to see if the doors are manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
Human senses, however, have not been completely replaced by advanced techniques.
One door to A320 is 1500 threads.
They have to knock manually.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the fitting hammer, they'll know if he's already knocked right up.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The aeroplane may be above the surface of the plane from zero to 0.13 millimeter.
That's about twice the thickness of the human hair.
The check comes on a series of trained hmats.
When the controller goes through a number of rivets, he'll know if he's out of tolerance.
When he takes the exact pervert into his hand.
Flightman lived before 1989 a program of the training military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, neither of them was made.
The company must have quickly found new orders.
That's when she got together with the European Airbus manufacturer.
She won a selection procedure for the supplier of emergency doors for model A321.
The talks with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were a small company that didn't have enough money to invest, and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," he recalls Dubsky.
The doors to the US producers would remain insecured if Letov hadn't taken part in the Prague Conference of the International Aviation Industry Group of Latecoere in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, the French had a meeting, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and came with a strong company.
The assembly of the door parts for A320 started in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door came for A380.
In 2006, the company built a new complex processing hall for deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or parts.
Partners want a van guarantee for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubsky.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after taxing CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position between suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, no plane door would be made.
Get certificates that the production processes correspond to customer requirements, and keep them in recurring controls, according to the Dubsky millions of crowns.
Production processes are amended each year.
They're more accurate and strict.
We have to graduate employees, train the equipment, and re-certify the entire process, delivers Dubsky.
Now the company finishes the process for coating with zinc and nickel, which replaces the present harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they were awarded to the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology to the devices or chemicals they used in Prague.
The Boeing people are coming to check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
One set of samples will test themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, approach the Dubian way the customers control them.
The reward is the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
Today, the Prague race stands and the production of embryos falls down.
For A320 it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacement of Czech Latecoere is either impossible for Brazilian or European manufacturer or very complex.
However, it does not mean that he could say any price behind the door.
The contract is part of the price curve.
That's how many doors they're gonna stand after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece still drops to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we're going to work, he says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where electric cabinets are set for the military aircraft Airbus A400 M, is so far empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
There's a new semi-robotic line for riveting and mounting doors for an innovative model A320 Neo.
The cleaning will speed up and steady.
"This is the trend that air installation takes place," Dubsky adds.
The conquest has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airline companies have already ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Only a few meters away from the A380 upper deck is a line for complete assembly of doors.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubsky.
However, before that, the company must pass the qualification tests, for example, for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices at the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also bets for further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, the new Airbus A350 programme should also be involved in competing to the US Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when he can process compositions except metal materials," says Dubsky proudly.
Latecoere, however, gets to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place at Letov's premises.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800, and in three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing get ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft order airlines every year, they don't have to worry about their work.
Although he has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company faced the threat of bankruptcy in Prague Latecoere.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay out the loans.
In the end, Latecoere managed to deal with the main creditors.
At the end of August, part of the loan exchanged for shares.
The creditors have gained a share of 37.4 percent in the company with a capital increase of EUR 57.4 million.
The company's debt has fallen by two thirds, i.e. by EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial healing came in early September.
The company has paid a new share of EUR 222,9 million among existing shareholders.
In total, it increased its capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which participates 85 percent in the market.
The average growth of contracts is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
The contract book has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to the four-year production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on liquids.
The Czech race in Prague Letňanes is important for groups.
16 percent contributes to the group's sales.
According to the number of employees, the largest foreign branch of the group is.
The Members supported a greater proportion of the state's coal charges.
The change in mineral mining fees is intended to bring CZK 427 million to the State Treasury more than in 2013.
The income of municipal budgets is expected to have a neutral effect by the government, as the fee is to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipalities received about CZK 450 million and the government budget of CZK 150 million.
From the mining of brown coal, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns came from the municipalities.
The novel also counts with an increase in remuneration from the residual area with a allowable mining of thousands of crowns per hectare per year.
The collection of these remuneration is to remain fully part of the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the villages will receive CZK 14 million per year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but the government shall establish it by its regulation.
The refund shall be calculated as the result of the quantities of mineral extracted and the rates for each species of minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation is the reason for a change, among other things.
The ODS Marek Benda alerted, however, that setting the fee of the government's regulation does not have to be in conformity with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Młodka, in this case, it is not a tax because the State pays inefficiency which is a sovereign property.
Only municipalities whose territory are affected by mining shall receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of money will get the state.
The same ratio will be in case of radioactive mining.
The part of the money that is on the mining fees will be assigned to purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to remedy damage after mining or in order to provide a rescue service.
Today, opposition Members have criticized the above, who have claimed, in particular, that they would damage the municipalities affected by mining and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostes) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they did so far as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget by the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (East) elected in the Ústecké kraj.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, Ms KSČM Hana Aulická warned.
Kadner and Aulická failed to propose to reject the novel, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The reasoning report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in coal prices is not expected because prices are more than 90 percent long-termly contracted.
The main consumers as power plants or heat plants should therefore not increase prices.
"But on the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will increase their remuneration will compensate for the efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mainly mean the reduction of employees," admits the government.
However, it believes that the increase in employment fees is abundant.
According to the rapporteur, the amendment of Milan Urban (ČSSD) is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If the coal is profitable for the limits, then it will have the impact on the revenues for both the country and the villages, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
It believes that the limits at the bottom of the ČSA should already be broken for social, national and economic reasons due to the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the American Federal Reserve meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision whether to increase interest rates for the first time for almost decades.
The survey of 80 economists addressed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain unemployed for a while and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been sat for years since the Fed has reduced rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero line and start the process of standardisation of interest rates," says Angel Ubidde, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy has done quite well, there has been recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to a state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready to increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a note in which he claimed to be "late" his first murders and wishing he could take it back, revealed the government offices on Tuesday.
Gautier police in Mississippi said that Lamb, teacher of geography and social sciences at the Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around ten o'clock.
and he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the cops to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there is a "healthy dog" in the house, which "he won't bother anyone," but he's upset.
The police demanded a caller's name, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why the shooting was in the house.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss found her body and a handwriting message from Lamb, in which it stood: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person she ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb went to Delta University 300 miles long, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and took his own life.
The Dean of the University, William LaForge, said that he had no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “something had occurred in Mr. Lamb’s head.”
Even despite the Monday statement that Lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship with Amy Prentiss and the government authorities, Schmidt said that there are no “love triangle” evidence.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss over seven years, said she was a “great person.”
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but they were both friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was the whole case shaken.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, Prentiss worked from the house through the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, was dating Lamb for about three years.
“ She always wanted to help others,” said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that he would not go to jail.
When the police caught him on the highway near Greenville later the same night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to the biography published on the school website, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
The stars that lost their magic
The actor (left), on a picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for drug holding.
I'm sure all these things choose their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of the right leg during Manchester United defeat in Lize Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left the left defender leaves this tear injury and eliminated it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused Héctor Moren's uneven procedure in 15 minutes when the 20-year-old Shaw went to the PSV area.
Nine minutes was treated on the field and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester in 18 years is very difficult, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the wardrobe, he also had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt kick.
Judgment Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Galle suggested that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge yourself whether it was a penalt and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shawa's account says, "Thanks all for their reports, words can't express how I'm devastated, my way to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shawa injuries against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recovery in the form of European championship in France next July.
Phillip Coc, coach PSV, said, "It was a very ugly wound."
When any player leaves the field with such injury, everyone is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the players.
Moreno suffered a fracture of his leg in the fight for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the World Championship 2014.
"It is very difficult for him, because his intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of such injury, it is not good," Coco said.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
All I saw was the ball that was headed the other way, so it looked like [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see the surgery on Luke.
In the interview for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how she feels, I know how difficult this could be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling.
David Cameron sure knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long to learn her almost memory.
Of course, you must not be David Cameron.
On the question of the child schematic provider to appoint a favorite children's book, the president of the Lorax government, a fairy tale from Dr. Seuss of 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in the report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I liked to read to my children, because there was always a picture or message that I've never seen before."
All right, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story of the book by the elevator from the 2012 film, which added other figures and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes that he gets the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is a stunning content of the book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't very suspicious, the text delivered by Cameron reads as a cumulative elevator of the Lorax film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In Thneed-Ville, a clouded wall where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes that he gets the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not meet the history of the book, where the unnamed young man will know that the local nature devastates the county trees of the once-ler industrialist, who, despite the protests of the titled Loraxe, a skipped, mourned creature that "speaks for trees."
Most likely, the relatively little important PR task was received by a helper who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in pieces.
The Downing Street spokesman said the text probably came from Cameron's senior office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but still holding on.
Coping with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after watching the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think the repeated defeat of 3-0, which she suffered last time in the test series, will not be too likely.
I wouldn't have directly ruled out the guests' win.
Alastair Cook's side can be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in this spine group and also collective thinking is strong; they won't bear scars from 2012, only a juvenile positive.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is an evolving spinner and Adil Rashid, even though he is unknown at the level of the trial series, representing an attacking opportunity.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of England's team in a series of experiences and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze because his chief coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but hard reality is that the players are being judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name of Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because, and this is what I've mentioned earlier, players are their best selectors.
A few more centuries, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performance was not completely 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question is how much trial time he gets to show himself is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could remcate is that England gave the chance to Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this lost opportunity is the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and that's a bowler I value very positively.
He's an x-factor player of cricket we've seen here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season where he won 236 on Trent Bridge field that kind of did.
It must be given at least the same opportunity that his predecessor received, but this will, of course, depend on the total assembly in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts with Cook, who would have gained another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was brought up, and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why strokemaker can't launch, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was a number three and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 trials before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded in three centuries, and he didn't even look.
In the team Zafar Ansari comes as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I can see it as primitives, but there are no many spinners who would raise their hands and selectors decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever supplements to their coach staff.
Appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a master move from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and mistress spark.
I always felt he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahel, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the wardrobe, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Co-worker Colly Durham Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many of them are unconsensible, coaches and selectors don't make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
Brexit's campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
The implied strategy of renegotiating David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every day past and without the permission of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Head of the Working Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is falling down in various crises - not all of them are guilty - some Member States have already had enough British self-centric agendas, sharing concessions and disturbing changes in the contract that they usually did not want.
At their annual Brighton meeting, the TUC decided that they wouldn't want it even if they were on social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor are going to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolitans, taking a photo before the famous local monument, with or without local advocates, and then return home with words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look into Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sized ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, the German prudently balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but she was in power for 10 years, and she wants to leave her post before it becomes bad, as it was for the continuing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francouz François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power falls too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch their legs break through the help of Selfia Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving UK - which is something they themselves don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan intentionally unnecessary comments of SNP style during the campaign before referendum 2017 in Great Britain to succeed the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britania has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know how expensive Fleet Street can be and how sceptic to the EU are the press oligarch Barons because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can mately remember the name Boris Johnson, a jumpy Euro-Oportunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his patience, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included mixtures of non-paying taxpayers, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo non-Overseas departments that owned most of the great newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a shredded gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so that you don't have to have dinner and then have some tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he was proposing Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of annulled EU constitution, which was sank by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and gained the card of discharge.
The press never forgave him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly cried me in Westminster on Monday at the back - I told him that he can't waste my time anymore - seems to be in danger of re-approving Murdoch Neil Kinnock's battleship strategy, which was a mistake now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but with Andrew Marre, whose seat at BBC left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I say it nicely, evolves.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most of the people outside the furious tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can definitely come to it.
That's what Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbynov's appointment of abrasive McDonnella as a shadow Chancellor was the wrong decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father was fighting for his loyalty on TV without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was a lot more attractive.
But fighting for staying "in all circumstances" - Benna's phrase - apparently it wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whether the background is any sensitive image that Corbyn wants to say - remember, he touched me - disciplinary news remains important in the ages of the full - day television transmission, and especially in faith, paranoia paranoia and treason, which are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Working Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbynova's basic cruelty about EU membership - in accordance with their Bennite surrounding the economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism is the narcism of small differences in the central essence of dogmatic hammering.
As with his cruelty about Nato - Tom Watson believes that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the sense of all this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - have suspicious voters - for the UK concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States are already quite disappointed in the Britain's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday opening of something called the British Security Forum of influence.
Experts criticise an e-mail review published by Public Health England
The statement by the government funded by the Agency on the fact that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking was made from the meeting of 12 people from which some are connected to the tobacco industry are listed by researchers.
Experts writing in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet critic of evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE published a "limitary" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive examination of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the availability of data and pointed out the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The editor in the Lancet professional magazine attacked the "mimoorly chateau base" on which the PHE founded its main conclusions last month.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ questioned the claim that was allegedly "stamped on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claim that the public could expect that PHE's claim, which is "current best estimates" is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called for the analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on damages, associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations have been summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell states that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had previously received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the Sustainability Report.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting granted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing it allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of the panel members is not available, but they contain several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspaper.
Some other presents at the meeting are not known for their expertise in combating smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by tobacco leadership.
The report created in this group "excusefully admits," missing "hard evidence of the harmful majority of products at most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Convenience at PHE, said that the claims in BMJ have already been answered before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifetime smokers will die for their addiction.
All evidence suggests that health risks represented by electronic cigarettes are small compared to, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows, and also what they do not display, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people per year die of smoke-related diseases and smoking costs £2 billion a year.
Clearly emphasizing the present evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, there are only a fraction of damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competences.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, claiming former headquarters Channel 4
Former Head of Channel 4, Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirming that his commercial rivals would "should give a right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programmes that are not formed by other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for setting up public service programs, which will probably follow only a handful of people, into complex broadcasting times compared to its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was inevitably trying to connect to BBC for six years who worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that BBC is providing and sending programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without State contributions," said Johnson in the communication committee in the Upper House, as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you keep licence fees that I am not sure whether they are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least in relation to programmes that do not produce or do not provide other programmes.
They're sending The Voice in the main broadcasting time because they want to get as broad as possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a ridiculous joke, and obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why the regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed unaccompanied.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and obviously produced on the ground.
To be honest, other channels would be able to give their right hand.
I can't understand how these broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would even weaken the BBC in the least.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said BBC felt guilty by chasing ratings "for the ambitions of people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular shows of BBC repeats the former Executive Director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more rigid public service programs BBC "goes to BBC4, where quite often can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their powers and can argue when they're planning on their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn licensing fees, "But of course we're doing all these obscure programs that no one's looking at."
They're broadcasting them at a time when no one's looking at them.
With regard to the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I call you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value out of him.
Obviously, we all think that 150 British pounds per year are a big sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at BBC.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared in front of the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should revise her reithov mission in the sense of "inform, educate and have fun."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC's production was already classified as educational - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take a model for public broadcast in Australia and Canada and change to "information, clarification and entertainment".
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which were only broadcast by a handful on TV, and connect to commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the directions that the clay moves.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control the sound waves.
Small clays change direction at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses that are unheard for human ears.
Pulses work so that they switch cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have said that these worms are a great demonstration of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasounds to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activate itself outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said for the Guardian log that this method could one day replace a deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure where the patient's brain is incorporated by electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Patrol usually does not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would occur when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles strengthen ultrasonic waves that then pass through the worm body.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells that are connected to them are listed in the report of the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the clay using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then used ultrasound to so modified worms, the sound waves were strengthened by micro bubbles and moved to worms where the modified motor neurons turned on.
The new method is similar to optogenetic, pioneering tools that enable scientists to switch and turn off neurons using light.
But Chalasani had heard that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technology.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired position in the brain, ultrasonic waves may penetrate tissue without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can focus on human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of insulin-producing muscle cells and cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisers deterring British weapons trade.
Take a look at the video of the Amnesty International anti-brain market.
Terrible assassin drones!
Eyes on the legs that break ankles!
Cruel missiles!
And electric shovels that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave any traces!
Merry voice and metaphor caricature leave no one doubt that this advertising on the world's largest weapons fairs is a sharp parodie created for Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defence and security facilities International Veselice in ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But the separate campaign is also carried out with posters on bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"An important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the letters with the designs of the London Metro with DLR lines becomes the image of the tank.
This September the roo of arms dealers will descending to DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop trafficking weapons.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collection called Special Patrol Group is helped to distribute all over London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which allegedly "avails about a third advertisement space bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not covered by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Cruel Designs and professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists move to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to influence their arts on society.
Another of the posters against the trafficking of passengers' weapons in the subway.
The video Amnesty was viewed on Facebook for more than 100 000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP working without entitlement to a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The Creative Director of the VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the weapons commercials - saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign that tries to avoid."
They were messing with creating more realistic corporate advertising, but "the addition of different colors and animations, I felt that more people would be attracted."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us to raise concerns about selling illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need right now is that the UK government should take measures and ensure that the torture facility does not illegally trade on our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the trade with weapons comes from the inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic eufemist products.
In the press release, Saab revealed an order from the American army on the "on the shoulder of the AT4CS RS launch."
This includes "one shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life on college
11 years ago, I moved to college like an unremarkable 19-year-old boy, still believers in bartenders and moral relativism, but until now I remember the tense smiles of those I had disregarded - and numerous, long-term complaints on others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on to the track can move from slightly to nerves going to totally shocking.
It's tempting to fool: to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year's break, what you're thinking of Corbyn and why "you don't even really hate Marmit because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA's ribbons, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and show interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and the ones you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they would issue fireworks.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms often change to drinking receptions, movie nights and municipal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and modify underwear.
Related: Don't even think about you going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college will just come.
Your room should be a refuge, yet a lot of tracks change into an extra-room walk culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture lets you say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing, and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One kid in my tracks used to that if the door wasn't locked, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of a baking mania, knocking on a foreign door and the show with a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less odd, less than "Welcome in the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
It's a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end up by assigning your face to a delicious surprise.
Of course, that's the subject that you're a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and fat probably disrupt that others will pretend to sleep if you try to knock on their doors.
Theft of food is a common crime on students' tracks.
Theft of all chickens is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk into your tea stealing?
Check it twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they run inside.
If someone steals anything from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate who's switched their milk for a dish washing device to punish the thief.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noises that disrupt people from sleep or studio.
It's not just being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could keep the drum and bass a little quiet because they were three nights, and she had a paper in the morning.
Their response was to strengthen music.
When they finally sat down at 5:00 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then she let her own music out, locked the door and went to her three-hour writing.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing if you mistaked your roommates for your future husband, slept together, broke up and had to see each day, and maybe she would also take control of your common friends?
Of course, you won't advise your heart - but if your sexy roommate 100% isn't your future husband, try to at least talk to your weaknesses.
At a thrilling moment when you realize that someone left the keys in his unsealed room, there's only a thin line between funny and bullied.
A good joke is funny, but it'll be easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding them something - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the doors and put the keys in the bottle with the water you put in the freezer, but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the insecure prospects of the future.
Eva's had a terrible moment during her pregnancy with today's seven-year-old witch.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I was dealing with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to having a baby and looking for positives in it.
Insecurity and being alone with a child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not stay alone for a long time, remembering Eva today about our first pregnancy.
She already met on the internet on the cabin of the older Vaška, with which they started talking about the favourite movies.
Your Eve and Vitek even brought home from the midwife, but he didn't play too much for his stepfather.
"For a while, he went off the program," she described Eva in documentary series Four in that 3.
The theme of the third series of Czech television series is just looking for happiness at the second attempt.
Care for the Vitek and the financial security of the family has managed through part-time work and great help of the mother and the help of the aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a strange child, after all, did not spoil your affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around the Vitek's second birthday, and he now understands the Vaška as his father, and he also calls him so.
Even though Yourk has two adult daughters, his fatherhood enjoys 60 according to his words, and he is also more devoted to the children.
In addition to the Vitka, there was a two-year-old Leontine and finally the twins.
"Your man got into our family, somehow naturally, maybe even by my mother never talked too much," he thinks Eva's smiling.
There's no room?
At least we're close.
Em's twins and Ela were born with a emperor cut after Eva was diagnosed at the end of pregnancy by the pregnant cholestasis.
This is a malfunction in the production and activity of bile acids, which occur in excess of pregnancy and are particularly itching.
Disease is dangerous for the unborn fruit, which threatens to premature birth and death, most of all of the time will be self-defense in the mother after birth.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Vaškova, even though they were only at the age of 36.
They put an incubator in the intermediary department where Vaschina also works a niece who was able to take and stay.
Elinka was bigger and right after I had her in my room, describes the difficult period after Eva was born.
She spent 20 days in the maternity until the doctors agreed to release the baby, which, in the meantime, managed to reach two kilos.
The waiting for Eve's childbirth to be recruited, but it didn't do the joy.
"I was a crazy stunt after my husband and children," he recalls the difficult moments at the department of the six-day four-fold mother.
She and her husband considered to sign a reverse, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, this did not happen, and the doctors released Eve and twins into domestic care.
The stories of four pregnancy and births broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
A total numbered family can be settled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to do with electric two-plosh and troubled conditions.
The house did not increase, but Yourk made Eve joy by planting a gas cook to prepare a meal for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll be turning into a cab.
Eva is convinced that the children are particularly perceived of family comfort and pleasant atmosphere, not size or vagueness of the house.
For the time being, we've been doing a lot better than we expected.
Although the mess is worse hides in a small space and we sometimes cross the baby, but at least we're all close to each other, Eva smiles, which can find a positive side on every situation.
The vascular work of the lighter in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes he goes to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, family finances and children are physically managed, how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, I will be the one who will feed this family," Eva admits to the straightforward questioning the future.
She'd like to get back to work, but she's even more attracted to her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly terrain for the employer.
And when it's worse, my husband and I can switch for a cab, he's joking a nice blonde.
Apple affected a jo-jo effect.
It's all for displaying.
More powerful processor, camera with greater resolution, tighter chase or display recognizing the touch power, these are shortly the preferred iPhons of the ninth generation.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhons 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Appla was that every new generation of iPhon is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight slightly increased compared to the previous iPhons.
The difference in the disadvantage of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from the new iPhons.
Apart from last year's iPhons 6 and 6 Plus, the mass increased by 14 grams in a smaller model, then by 20 grams.
On the one hand, the last year's affair of shying in Apple's pockets has suffered considerably.
Novelty is so from a more resistant aluminum alley of 7,000, which was also displayed on the weight.
But more impact on her has screens.
Apple used the 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to which the display recognises the power of touch.
To this end, the display had to be equipped with another layer of capacity sensors.
The mass of the new iPhons displays increased more than twice compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhon of originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of greater 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhon 6s is thus the hardest component to be used.
Weights of only 143 grams are then achieved in this news also thanks to the cutting cortex that touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed anything compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is apparent at the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhonu 6s Plus is equal to 192 grams.
As long as the new display technology will be practical, it will appear when it is used.
The first users will be able to try this on Friday 25th September, when the sale of iPhons 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in the selected countries.
Are there flakes for champions' breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists made a finding that opens interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of sedation by a modern man from different times, including wall paintings, the rest of the tools and so on and so on.
In a layer of 23A, which according to the tools dated up to about 30,000 years ago, but scientists discovered something that very much reminds the rest of the breakfast buffet.
Because there were traces of oatmeal grains, which apparently passed through the process of production of such popular flakes today.
In her grains are first soaked today, then dry, dispose of the packaging, the so-called plump, then burnt, and sewage.
In Paglicci's cave, the grains appeared to be warmed or burned, and then apparently crushed between two mill stones - at least it indicates the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Scientists have thus failed to prove in their publication for the PNAS magazine that there would be a complete process of production of flakes in the cave, but similarity is really very apparent.
We also have no evidence of how the flakes could have eaten, but the idea that it was with some fluid and maybe warm enough, of course, is offered completely logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intense people used cereals long ago before the origin of agriculture.
If fertile interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have preceded agriculture for about 20,000 years.
New report stations in the Transport Business of Brno.
So, once again, I listened to the report of the names of the stop at the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so the male voice report was slightly less understandable than before when the stops were reported with a female voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic, it is more discernible than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that the passengers themselves chose this voter - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they definitely picked it out of study recordings made in absolute silence, which obviously sounded quite different than in the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops, so I don't need this report, but strangers who don't recognize themselves in Brno, and for which these reports are mainly intended, can be confused and can be confused at the final where they accidentally arrived, then claiming that the stop they were supposed to come out was never reported at.
Perhaps the choice of the speaker - but better again the speaker - to do again, and this time it is painted by the normal traffic noise and the speed of the engine in which the reproductor is almost lost in the bus.
So we don't need to listen to the names of the water Heršpice stations, Šmírov, or then the Submarine in the shale that I've crossed into in Komárov.
I'm assuming my old hearing didn't get so much worse during the only day the voter changed.
Before that day, I understood the report quite well.
Good morning, comrade Chief.
From the track logs.
Today, no one knows what the biggest and smartest governments of the parties were so-called complex clearances.
I've been allowed to remember that.
The bus was late.
I ran into the headquarters' office when the radio sounded like it was just seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't go down with your comrade chief, come a minute before you, and it seems like she's not in the mood," he recorded the dispatcher while I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll take care.
Write me that I'm going after the slices at the revision of a small mechanistic.
I can't do that. There's a check today.
They're all fucked up, they're terrifying.
What's going on?
"Everything you'll see," the dispatcher's licked.
Next time, you'll be there.
I ran out on the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
A drunk, with a stone face, in a perfectly fallen uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said hello, and he quickly turned on two jackets.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, naughty tone to which the old answered.
"You're messing with," welcomed me to an engineer Eva, an old lady I was very much hesitating.
They even said she was the chief before the comrades settled her.
They're check-ups, and you'll be there.
How many times I asked what the complex clearances are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they're one in three years, all of them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
For some, at least.
I said I'll see.
I pulled out of a scarf fascinating with periodic reports and this phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me right now," said the chief's voice.
What's he bothering?
Now we met and nothing ..." I mummed, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good day, comrade Chief, I came to your order," I checked out, I only entered the chief.
The chief was sitting behind the writing table and looking at some leyster.
"Company of the mechanizator," said after a while, without raising his head and looking at it carefully, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw a leister on the table, cast himself in a chair's backup and looked at me with a normal, unpleasant, bad, picheaded view.
I messed up.
What's going on?
Last night, the deputy commended that I worked very well in the office for a few months and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the lens at the distant.
And now this?
You realize that you're a track distance technique and that's what you have to act.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I swore that I'd used that kind of greeting since I was a childhood that I'd been so raised and that I didn't see anything wrong about him.
It was like a red turkey cloth on the chief.
"You're on socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the work," the washed chief.
Plus, you're still mistaken about speaking to the superiors.
One day, you say "sir" and again, "comrade."
But I'm not a chief for you, but a comrade chief.
Comrades are the deputy, the top of the tracks are the corridors of the top tracks!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... comrade Chief, but... but I said hello to you in common civilian greetings.
There's nothing wrong with it... and the honor of work, or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your priority that you're not on the side," said the cold chief who in the meantime calmed down a little bit.
There's gonna be a talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the person in question.
He used to stab me with a cold, picheaded view, and I was looking for the words I would have answered.
I was also annoyed by his promotional bar.
He was just a few years older and played for God's sake, actually, comrade God.
He's a real, fierce, authoritarian, arrogant, how he's doing right now.
He's the one who's been deceived.
So be it, he's the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the guardians, he was ticking.
But the chief rode many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
He just shot me for a total bullshit.
I thought something about my ass, and it cost me enough extortion to not shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the crumbs anymore, let alone make a vigilante.
What would I use two kids from?
And a built-in house!
I was crying, but I'm in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all you can do so far," ended the audience of the chief and began to look again closely at the leyster that he had in his hand before.
I was summoned at 6:30.
Everyone in the office was already there and for questions what and how, how did they say, yes, it would be good.
Only Jožin's bitterly said, as he used to be, that they can't throw us all away because he would have to do the work by himself with his loyal ones, and that he wouldn't threaten us.
The word "partner" emphasized, as if he knew what the old man shot me in the morning.
There was a nice meeting at the chief's office.
Comrade Chief behind his writing table and at the long advisory table, other comrades who should have decided on my official being or not.
Cadrovek, chairman of ROH, staff writer, referencer for special purposes, something to contradict on the military, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the president of the party organization.
I knew him from the steak.
A regular track worker, beaten the dust or saws, throwing the jaw.
But also a former guard.
It was heard that there was no fun with him that time, that pretty beast.
Bad languages claimed that school went out in the seventh grade, he didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the criminals canceled, he ended up at the crumbs.
But Comrade, yes, the comrade was framed!
Chief asked me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an incompetent shilling in my neck.
The trainer read the opinion from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two children, and so on, and so on.
So far, it's okay, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then, from the street organization of the party.
He was copying his opinions from the Civil Committee, perhaps both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the Party for a long time, refused to come to the audit committee and subsequently appeared, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
The trainer noticed and stopped reading.
Chief told me to keep going.
It's been worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who stepped up, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I had a wedding in the church, except for the National Committee.
I disappointed the confidence of the side in the worst way.
That's why I've been cut out of the number of candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, told the church funeral, although it was a former party member.
All of this, I show a negative attitude to the leading role of the party.
When he finished the cdriver, only squeezing the chief's pencils into the table was interrupted by the tense silence.
Everyone looked at me honestly, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
And I kept saying, "Communists - superhuman, Communists - superhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay at the cows?
I could've fixed the blasts without some fucking check-ups.
But now?
She took her career before she started it.
Go back to the janitor?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief's gonna fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade you've been discussing here?" he interrupted the silent chief with a question for the wheelchair.
Well, according to the previous job report.
Do you have it here?
Obviously, it wasn't overtime for the trainer.
In the steaks, the steeps are sweaty, nervously peeling, like he's been tested himself.
He slipped up and handed some paper to the chief.
"Oh," said the chief, with a sign of purity, which, however, often used to pronounce the storm.
On the first look of praise, taught with honor, graduated from industry, worked in the task wage as a locker, he served the standard on average to a hundred percent.
But it's not important.
Where did you get that judgment, comrade?" He turned again to a man who felt that it was starting to turn against him, and that he might not have been a chase.
This is where my comrade gave it to me on board.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the lens," he blew a crab.
And that's not where the assessments are required, he was kind of an extra, so I put it in his file.
"So, when you were involved in the technical function, this piece of paper was enough for you," the drought said the chief.
He was nervous to blink, and he wasn't answering anything.
"No matter what, we'll talk about it later," the chief and the cdriver obviously got relieved.
He's stopped it for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly, it's over!
It's got ecstasy in my eyes, it's hot.
He followed the cause of remorse and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world that didn't deserve the least mercy.
That I was misleading an incomplete review by mistake of a comrade of a discreet referent, and I didn't understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from a trainer in a fabric.
I am also an anti-socialist nutrient who, at the time of building a real socialism, promotes the rears of religious darkness, even taking part in them.
That there was a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'm still going to do, and I've been quietly praying that it's over.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I could get out of the mechanistor's place.
I didn't care if I got the shrimp.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I've been in the eyes of a comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," said the chairman of the party, and he strongly interrupted the left of the chief.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he's done!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
To open up again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke as a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so rectified or is he papouching phrases from party training and meeting?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
The chances to prove that he's changed.
And who's supposed to give it to him, not just you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misled comrade, to support in his efforts to remedy!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty to all of us too.
The comrade here has to see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she punishes not only, but that she also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one even looked up.
No one expected such a turnover.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, comrade President," the chief icely appealed to take over the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd hear that that's what I've been heading for.
They all agreed to inspire their heads, but they saw that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate referencer for basic resources," I covered when I returned to the office and cried again.
Well, I'm glad except for an engineer, Eva, they were all on lunch.
The silence was listening to my indefinitely listing of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, I asked if I could have some coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she built water for the cook and washing the pots.
Meanwhile, she talked about the cdd practice.
Like one judgment, often full of praises, they give a man in the hand, and the other where there is dirt will send to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had it, but on the squad at the crumbs, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our trucker?
He only cares where he eats or drinks, and he finally figured out what happened.
"He's got it from an old man," she said.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him, he's very revenge.
And the Party Chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no humanity.
Zero from a shrimp having a great power.
The coffee water started to boil and the office filled with a smell of just lit coffee.
I put a sugar cube in my cup and the silence was mixing a hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
Now he's not gonna fire me, and the next check's in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't just forget that day.
It was published in LITERAT’s anthology at TRATI II in the publisher of EPIKA
The symbol of the village has revived.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlume is turning again after years.
It's seen far away because it's located at 15 meters high cone.
The people in the wide area call him the "chlum star."
For the village, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the general sign, which the village gained for the opportunity of the reunion of the natives in 2010.
"We asked for the sign then, and we wanted a fan on the mark, of course, knowing it in the surroundings," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it recalls the time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
Until in 1910, the silk representatives decided to deal with the solution, which was then suited until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turning point in China, they had a deep well out of seven meters.
Three years later, the well complemented a metal construction with a wind pump that pumped the water into the reserve at the highest point of the village near the church here.
"The state has made Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia with a cost of 2 400 crowns," says the memorial inscription on the ground floor replacing the construction of the cone.
After several repairs and falls of the wind bike served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, the new chapter of the fight for water began to be served by the new water supply in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional general symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant was run during this year's family reunion.
Until in 2008, the Chlums decided that the wind bike would repair again and bring it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel, reduced on average by half meter.
The wheel was planted on the cone, but it had to be taken down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replicas did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist wind porns.
Then the Chloe dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, since this June, the bike on the high cord has been rolling again.
At the occasion of the replication of the wheels, the village allowed the replication of the wheel to adjust and residue it to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws useful water from the well only into a robbery blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the well.
At least it was rolling empty.
"In the autumn, we will reconnect the wind wheel shafts from the pump in the saturation basket," explains Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipalities in the Czech Republic, where the wind bike has entered the general sign, but the only village of this species in the whole Highland.
A similar feature in the mark is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškovsk, Kuželov in Hodonsk, Partutovice in Přerovsk or the Police in Vsetínsk.
Nothing bad, but I don't know the Lafat, admitted to the Tripolis Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-school press conference.
That time, Georgh Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I'll score Sparta now.
Just the difference we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 games for the Romanian representation is the key resistance of the Greek team.
As a stopper, it's going to face the raids of the spartian offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, he's talking about the Greek fight of the Hybš spartan.
And they partly know what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataia who played in the Romanian Astro with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, which is why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
Another footballers of the Prague club didn't name, so there was a direct question whether he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of Czech League and Captain Spart.
Goian smiled, and with a lightly comprehensive view he aimed at Czech journalists.
He said, "Why ask me?"
After a while, he triggered silence.
We saw some videos and I noticed Sparta was playing a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
Spartans know that about Goian very well.
"My experience in larger clubs, it can be said that he's holding the defense of Asteras, he's such a game organizer," observed by Spartian assistant Stanislav Heykal.
It's been the best years since Goian, but he can boast with a very interesting football resume.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both the United and City Manchesters, but from Steauy went to Italian Palerma, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a big team, playing European cups regularly, fighting for victory in Czech league.
For me, it's favorite in this game, but we're playing at home, and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we're going to try to win, said Goian.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very excited for the competition from Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague storm.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of the company's share trading at the Warsaw Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for the time being under the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the events in the company, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the movement of the group's seat, shareholders consider the placement of shares in the Prague stock exchange."
Due to the entry into Burza of securities Prague, the prospectus of valuable paper is completed by the Czech National Bank for approval as soon as possible.
The movement of the holding office and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
Therefore, under this operation, no shares will be offered to the public or to the new investors.
"The possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if so the company and its shareholders will decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," said the company.
The company has already stated that any offer of shares could consist of emissions of new shares or sales of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares also at the Warsaw Exchange.
Testing the objectivity of the Czech television in informing about the migratory crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of major Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time we broadcast the main news session of the Czech TV.
And how hard did she do it?
When they are at the Faculty of Journalists teaching about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcasting of Czech TV Events.
The migratory crisis was devoted to about 80% of reporting.
Until the first minute, when the ČT informed about the disturbances on the Serbian-Maďar border and the attacks of migrants on the police called euphemistically gone out of patience - throwing stones and attacking metal rods), the current promigrant propaganda was already on the way to review the names of individual reports.
The criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise migratory treatment.
Syrian children in Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
The refugees, not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Traveling refugees - ČT consistently uses the expressions of a runner or refugee and not a migrant.
The most interesting thing is that in illustrative footage, the ČT uses only consistently and only videos of small children and women.
At the same time, in the same broadcast, she said that 80% of men are held from migrants in the Czech Republic.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that has no communist agitations.
I have to say, as an ex- journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once I turned myself into a boarding apartment, soon I stopped being the only resident.
My fish has moved to the umacart toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with imperfect change, i.e., not producing the reproduction from the housekeeper to the bug and youth looks like an adult individual, only is small and gradually growing.
They were disgusting and I didn't lick them up.
First, hand and later both chemically.
The socialist druggery on their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it's called Cyclon B.
Or else?
However, it has successfully destroyed them.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs like that.
A box with some juvenalizator that the ants brought to the nest and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But that's what I turned off.
As time went, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly acknowledging the view that they had the same right to life as we people.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth in fleas and puppies I probably wouldn't have unpacked to make the karma worse by killing them.
In a new place, we agreed to the partner that if we hadn't had fishermen sticking behind our necks, let them eat waste leather in peace, some of those invisible algae and something like that.
Their peaceful existence in time broke the spider.
It was a common kind of pony who was based on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he was living from occasional mussels and mosquitoes, which just increased our comfort.
Because he spent several years with us, we found out that he was living mainly in fishery and that their number was apparently maintained in abundant number.
We found that she's a female.
For we have witnessed romantic talks with our partner about about a third of the smaller ones, as carefully advocates the fibres of the spider to be eaten before it reaches the exhausted coupulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move or react to our control.
Under the toilet mix where the love plays were played, we found the residues of the dried male next to the female later.
Then the spider hasn't moved for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a lot of small spiders hanging in her neighborhood.
They've disappeared soon.
They were eaten by a mother's hand, the work was broken apart.
Even the female went missing after a week.
If she left or passed away, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
Right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that grandmother's toilet.
For a while from the ceiling, she was careful to observe our behavior and to move under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-attack as a friendship.
The number of fish has decreased again, and the spider has looked at his routine activities in order to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed for a year.
Our daughter grew up in this age when the use of the night was already embarrassed.
We've tolerated it so far, but forever healing his content has already eaten.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more strongly.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider that she saw very well when she was wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, not having luck in the house at all.
She cried and screamed her nightclub.
It wasn't too much.
There was a moment when a spider, in the interest of a daughter's development shift, had to preach.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but I still felt awful after my long relationship, like I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would start to appear more often and start multiplying with a geometric series.
The world wonders, a week, two, none of us showed up.
I started speculating on the cause.
I was wondering if the spider was there, like, not growing up in an ants, that the toilet environment wasn't as favourable for their existence, as we thought.
But then the first mid-size bits appeared, and they've been chopped again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured that their bonding to the spider had to have a reason to say that if they didn't see him hiding in some other place and that they were at risk from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator and his rapid disappearance in them caused some kind of alarming reaction.
It's more like I don't make any illusions about their eyesight.
Some lights have shown, but that they would react to waxing hands or quick moves, no.
My daughter's been going to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she already forgot about the nightclub.
All we have to do is attract some spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to an ether, and I hope they haven't left me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cycle B.
A tenth of Albert Einstein's statements that enriched the world.
The expressions of the brilliant scientist of the past century seem to never be fascinated by humanity.
He was able to immerse everything so deep, that the exploding was always astonishing finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
The consciousness of the people entered primarily its special and general theory of relativeity, which has been best described by the universe in its giant ratio.
It can also be forgotten to clarify the photoefficiency or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very record and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so confusing for many so much that for closer recognition they prefer to choose easy patterns.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he hadn't even found a brilliantly simplistic form of explanation: The clock near your dear seems a minute; the minute in the hot furnace seems an hour - and that's relativeity.
I was allowed to choose from his entire pleas of famous quotes these tens that literally bragged me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, brilliant try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove I was right.
But the only time he can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break the atom than destroy the prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of a mess in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what to fight in the third world war, but in the fourth, it's gonna be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there are no ways to resurrect him.
Knowing little is dangerous and know a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying, 15 minutes of his analysis, and 5 minutes with his solution.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand the income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself not to introduce Einstein's formula to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula shall be paid: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z hold the tongue for teeth.
New and modern.
The hospital in Zlín County is waiting for a change of 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four are holding in black numbers this year," said the captain Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional facilities is about 32 million crowns at this point.
The share of this is mainly higher wages from insurance companies that are equally favourable for this year.
This fact also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetina, Uherske Hradnice and Zlín, it is concluding to constructions that will total almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time we used to buy equipment, it's over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them we can't do top health, he justified the plans of a regional deputy for the health care of Lubomír Nečas.
It looks forward to changes in all hospitals.
Builders will be coming to hospitals next year.
In Vsetin, they're now picking up the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
There's a dialysis port planned in the Amberland.
Uherské Hradiště wants to build a new intern for about 200 million for an open central pavilion this year.
And Bať's Zlín Hospital is waiting for a long-deferred construction of a new central income and an Internet that will need three quarters of billions.
In all cases, these are major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors this is an extremely important step," said, for example, the director of the hospital Věra Prousková.
The five-story building is to be finished in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for intern and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, beds and unit intense care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are significantly familiar with the patients will be affected by all regions.
For the new buildings are replaced by those, for example, in which there are many sick in one room, there is only one toilet on the floor, beds are inappropriate, windows intact and health careers do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our Internet was built five-five years ago and now it is at the border of its life," pointed out the director of the Berlin Hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Therefore, within a few years, the seven-floor modern building, connected with an urgent income, will replace it.
Physicians and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to new spaces.
The same model already has half the finished Uherské Hradiště.
Central income is already standing, and in three years, the Internet will be back to it.
"We will pay the state from the loan and partly from our own resources," said Director Petr Sládek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still the highest, and it didn't get to the loss two years ago, when the Zlin hospital needed to deal with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, increase income and efficiently manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is responsible for the economy.
Improvements are also expected by patients outside the cross hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, it will go into repairs, new instruments and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year, there will be a repair of the catch station, then the dialysis port begins, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country when they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after meeting with its European colleagues that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pushing to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how to keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic when they still do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," he said to the journalists.
Can you describe the position that you have come to the meeting of the Interior and Foreign Ministers of the European Union?
We disagree with compulsory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're heading somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we can keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, namely registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem.
That's what we've been talking about for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But say the quotas solve everything?
We've been dealing 40 grand recently, now it's a hundred twenty grand.
When's it gonna be five hundred grand?
And how are we gonna keep those people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us wants to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants us, we just don't know how to hold them here.
Ambitions are to come to us by other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country are gaining asylum in us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't want us, but 15 hundred people were already committed to accepting.
Wouldn't it be possible to take more of them this way?
We committed to accept 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even for those 1500, the point is that there will be 1100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come into our detention facility and we'll treat them as well as the ones we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe if we can hold people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Since Europe is acting in such a way that if they are registered, they cannot be detained.
This means that they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is not yet a deal, we may not hold the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will go back to Germany.
If we can hold them during the asylum procedure, we will deal with them with the asylum procedure.
If Syria's citizens, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of the European statistics receive international protection.
Then they get evidence that will enable them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people here to relocate.
This is the second project that is running so far, and there we have only progressed in debating with the churches about the possibility that they can help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.
But that's a run for a very long track.
You said that other states were not willing to discuss the meeting of ministers.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic simply refuses quotas, but does it offer a solidary step to unlock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidary step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany expresses the incentive for all migrants from Syria to them, this report shall be spread in order hours after all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migratory wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - just dissuade the migratory waves, help the necessary, and separate the economic migrants.
Clearly let them know they don't have a chance.
Fifty thousand Cosovans came to Germany for the last year.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturities of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we were able to separate them and not receive them or only accept them according to the needs of the economy, the 50 percent of what the social systems are spending on them today could go to refugees.
Contrary to the first day that Germany introduced inspections, the number of arrests in the Czech Republic has jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
How far is it going to make the border checks tighter?
We were afraid to catch hundreds of people in order.
These are the numbers we handle.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're gonna hold, we'll be returning Austria in seven days.
We're doing it as normal as we can.
The Raccusians are the only ones who take these people to us, Hungary is complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the break point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it'd have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities so much that the crisis plans will come.
Then I'm agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately summon the extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation occurs, the government may meet de facto immediately and, by one resolution, would decide to strengthen the military police, let's take the customs administration, or the prison service.
The country's option is the exceptional condition that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get that far.
Understand that our position is different, we are a national country within Europe, and we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that the Hungarians will try to turn the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched very marginal, almost at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debt for the last minute.
They're trying to stop declaring bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid debts.
Soccer players were waiting for their money.
Football Slavia was the first time on Tuesday because of the insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after, over about 20 million crowns, it was proposed by Online Services from the Pacific Samoa.
Law attorney Slavia Zuzana Mládková has tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl in a few hours that he is not supposed to declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And you have to say she had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week with the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, the new owners have arrived in the club for the last minute.
This proves to be expressed by Slavia before the Tuesday trial - the top club on Monday, only a day before the court hearing, he sent decades of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11th and September 15th," said Legislative Representative Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Contemporary and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovak exreprezentant Milan Ivan or the Czech backup Mario Ličkovi.
Slavia also paid the fee to Agent Alexandr Losenickem.
Already on Friday the club paid debt fees to the city part of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, they remain de facto only the claims that Slavia contradicts.
According to the club, the obligations in question have not occurred, or there are trials.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can add with a statement from the account," said Advocate Mládková.
"Everything after maturity is paid off," said Mládková and added that they were not paid only for unpaid or dissuased commitments.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
He gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
There will then be an evaluation of all evidence.
Therefore, the decision may be expected first in November.
The Judge ordered the conduct of the negotiations on the third November.
However, the decision does not fall at this meeting but in writing after it.

FastMig X allows welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which provide higher productivity and quality welding.
It ceases to waste time and there is no waste of material or repair of miscellaneous plants.
Flexibility is ensured, is less simple, more welding and higher profit.
It's this year's news that had the premiere in Nitra, where she also got the gold medal.
We respect these things very much because they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The leading world producers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and in the management of parameters, FastMig X belongs to the world's tip.
For the tenderers there are certainly pleasant delivery deadlines, which travel around three weeks.
We have already established first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will surely expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years, and almost always our business results are better than before, stressing for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, the head of the Kemppi store in Plzni.
FastMag X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
The Blanka went to build it so it didn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka went down safer and safer, says the expert.
The tunnel complex Blanka was possible to build two landfalls in the Prague Stromovce, claimed by the Managing Director of Satra, which is the main tunnel designer, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it on Wednesday night at a tunnel tour.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion more expensive crowns.
The drivers open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went safer, but costs grow exponentially," said Butovich.
The conditions in Stromovce were the same for the whole time, yet the country fell just a few steps away from where it began to be a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure was taken 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
Blanka tunnel fell three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater in Stromov was created, in 2010 the land fell through the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the head of Metrostav Jiří Bílohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said a weekly Euro.
According to original intention, the construction was worth 17 billion crowns.
When we add VAT that has doubled over the construction period, you have 17 billion.
When technology, land redemption and engineering, valorisation and similar items add up to it, it's 29 billion, which is no longer that far from the 37s, said the Whitehead
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple Update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings, when you click on the card "General" and select "Software Update" (software update).
When he's ready, he'll offer you a possibility to download your phone and then install it.
Some users have dealt with an after-installation problem, namely the error phrase "the software update has failed".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait for the interest in updating or try it through iTunes.
The phone will make you the update process.
And this, including the need to uninstall the application for the release of the site, will not be necessary, because Apple's update has reduced and also facilitated the entire process by using a special tool that will suggest applications for delete and reinstalled after the update is completed.
Make sure your phone is loaded before you run the update.
If the battery status is low, Apple will not allow the update to be started because the interruption of the process could cause an update error.
Further reports: iOS 9 was not postponed, despite the delay of the WatchOS; iOS 9 review: exciting update of the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the issue of the new operating system for iPhone
Make sure you have passed our list of things to do before updates that try and prevent or protect yourself from them. iOS 9 will present new functions, including even smarter personal assistants and a large range of creative functions for iPad, as well as many platforms to speed up and repair the operating system.
FedEx's profits mixed, decreased fiscal view for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecasts of the annual profit due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period of last year, FedEx announced that it would be renting for a holiday of 50 000 seasonal workers.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in pre-marketing 45 minutes before the Wednesday opening.
FedEx states that he expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for a fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a drop by 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to the survey made by FactSet.
The reduced view comes despite an increase in interest rates on average by 4.9 percent, which will be shown in January. 4, and higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy or large packages that begin in November.
The company argued that it still expects growth in profits compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher income and growth in online trading.
The chairman of the Board and Director-General of Fred Smith said that the company "preserved firm performance despite the weaker than the expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were notified the day after the UPS Rival Company stated that he was planning to hire 90 000 to 95 000 additional workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In a quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The share gain was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts asked by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets have increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts in questioned by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by a decline in priority international shipping, which has resulted in a stagnation of revenue in its Expression Unit.
But boom in online shopping strengthened FedEx ground team results.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates while profit decreased in the cost trade due to higher labour prices.
About an hour before the FedEx's share was opened, it was $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended on Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent per year and 17 percent under the record of 11 June.
At its most unexpected session for years, federal reserve legislators spend two days this week established at 27 feet of the long Dutch Mahagon table and will decide whether after almost ten years it is time to increase the key interest rate.
On one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be the wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder of the fact that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to give the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and maintain stable prices here.
But from the Great Recession, the Fed leaders recognized that there was an unrecorded third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday, whether the American economy is ready to launch on the basis of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid growth of the economy, recent turbulence on the global financial markets could already be frightened by the fact that Fed was added to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economic operator of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient reason to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is the cause of nerve in the financial markets itself.
About half of the economists recently addressed by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to hold the matter, with only a key indicator of about 30% of the chance to increase.
This would indicate a decline in the share market in the event that the Fed will increase the rates, only if politicians deprive the promise that I will not see further increases.
On Tuesday, the industrial diameter of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The gathering was launched by expecting the Fed politicians to keep the rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, the main economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would now raise the rates," says.
If the Fed politicians would do that, "they'd have to go to the extremes in their programme statement and hold the financial markets behind their hands so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed would proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed was on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the power of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that, over the spring and early years, she expects an increase in rates this year, despite complaints from the liberals, that more economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate has declined to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in over seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers to be full of employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of lifting.
And although inflation continues under the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed's policy claims that the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices was the main reason.
Economy "is able to deal with higher rates and needs them, taking into account the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world began to deny the end of last month after China devaluated its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones decreased by 16% under its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drain global growth.
The market has somewhat bounced in this month and Dow is now losing almost 10% of the May maxima.
The political factors of Fed provide a comprehensive calculus when to start an increase in interest rates.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the leading researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of Fed.
Now he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact that this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became a monetary authority all over the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
A simple indication of the former President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "nail" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, it can be expected that Fed's leaders are watching developments elsewhere, but also consulting other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, the head of the global strategy for wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va, pointed out this month that "Fed has history overwhelmed with movements in financial markets that seem to be independent with economic foundations."
The voter of the Federal Open Market Committee, who pushed the increase in tariffs, quoted decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three meeting "I over limited identifiable impacts on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed leaders turned these cuts.
The Fed should prefer the concern of financial stability only during the large crisis, such as the market collapse of the year 2008, said Adam Posen S., former member of the rated committee in Bank of England.
The latest crows are not even approaching this level, said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of tariff growth because the markets were upset," said Posen, President of the Institute of International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it does not change, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/shop was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.

If you're hungry of all this shopping, go out for food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trade stand (good, cheap) is close to registers and has different sampling sites.
What's in the warehouse: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and others.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot that share with other shops and restaurants.
While business can be occupied, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways stays on the old side.
Acceleration at 150 km/h The House has rejected.
On selected motorway seatings, the maximum permitted speed of up to 150 km/h will not be possible under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to join the Senate's amendment that refused the speed increase.
The new law on ground communications will now head towards the president.
President Miloš Zeman, by the end of April, said that the law allowing a trace-satilometer rate would be intact.
Against the increase, the Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (ANO), according to which the Czech highway network has not yet been built on such speed.
Jook supported the Senate version of the law on Tuesday before the Members.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers in the classroom on selected first class roads, in particular four-ways.
The House first extended this option to the highways on which it would be possible to ride at selected speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused it.
The messengers have now come to his proposal.
The Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport from the amendment, also exempted the authorisation of the transport police to have the last word in adjusting local communications to which the villages are concerned.
The Senate version approved by the House also counts for sewering, water or public lighting cables to be stored along the surface of the vehicle.
The aliens would spare that for buying the land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The Novela is also intended to help improve road protection and to facilitate foreign handling of withdrawn vehicles to which owners do not report.
The new municipalities could be sold towed vehicles which will not be notified within six months of the notice of withdrawal of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to rule out transit freight through their territories on the roads of other and third classes under the threat of fines and for shipping companies.
The new option of introducing electronic highway marks is also abolished, instead of existing papermarks, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it saves money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The strike exprimator is in court.
He's 10 years in danger of predating his earrings.
The case concerns the allegedly overprietary project of the Welcome of Pupils.
The police also wanted to pursue Zuzan Kail (ČSSD), but the Chamber of Parliament did not give it up.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both to ten years of imprisonment are at risk.
The main listing is scheduled for two October days.
According to the D.A., Mandik and Macek caused a damage of at least one million crowns, it's a prosecution.
The applicant is leaning on an expert opinion.
Former city leadership members, according to the prosecutor's title, unauthorisedly made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company who organized the presidency's welcome.
Mandatory according to the prosecution to the Chief of the Magistrate Department of Municipal Services, Education and Culture, he filed five connected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company offered the lowest price came to the competition, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to confide the city to the administrator, and only Darothore signed into the competition, which was then assigned by the city's board.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges led to the purpose of ensuring for Darothore the award of a public contract to organise events Welcoming Citizens in Ústí nad Labem for a long-term and coordinated manner, at least inconsistent with the requirement for a proper management procedure, writes the State Attorney.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore was subsequently charged by Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the events, the Welcoming of Citizens' Award, which will be unproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company, according to the project's file, has erased more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then it resigned.
The amount paid was overwhelmed by at least one million crowns according to the expert opinion.
The Mandy has previously rejected any violations of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this bail I've already told the former primator that the city under his command has only made a similar project from the last few years.
Between 2008 and 2010, Roxy II has been providing the event.
"It was on the same terms, under the same money," he added Mandek.
The criminals originally wanted to accuse Ms Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
The Chamber of Emissary didn't give her up for prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the bail in her case, but they are counting that Kail's accused following the end of the MEP mandate.
Welcoming the peculiars was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian cops allegedly let the dog down on a fugitive.
Then they got the journalists to delete the record.
The Hungarian police said at the border with Serbia briefly arrested the AP cameraman and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
However, the Hungarian government questions this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the maize field near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
The fugitives have stepped up, and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on the pearl.
The dog of the man who screamed, "Please, I am a fugitive," says Muzi.
The fact that Muzi's filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and wouldn't let him leave.
The reporter couldn't make any more phone calls to his superiors, nor his colleagues at the scene.
The Muzi police took him to a dark place at the refugee registry centre and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of the two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP has sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government of Zoltan Kovács.
The police's behaviour has identified it unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to fear that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
Kovács challenged the police report on the musical events.
He said the police just wanted the journalist to show them whether they were on some footage, they said they had the right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make him do anything.
"The dogs may be barking - they are trained to scare and a little scare, but with certainty they did not attack," says Kovács.
The unpredictable League of Masters.
The winner of City will kick us, believe Juventus.
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," he crawled the head of Manuel Pellegrini, home school.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was the classic game of the League of Masters.
Not one team created too many opportunities, but the ball on the dumps had longer us.
"The cause of defeat was not in such a tactice, Juventus simply shot two beautiful goals," evaluated the Pellegrini game, whose team incapacitated in the competition game after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last season of Juventus was on it exactly the other way before the intercession - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has as a defender of the title only a point and the score 2:4 is located at the 16th place of the table.
That's why the turnover on Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally," says Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances - Pirla, Téveze and Vidala before the new year.
They've been replaced by Pogba, Mandžukich and Morata in Manchester.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps because of him, we'll find a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially at an attack phase.
This result deserves my players.
"Before our countervailing goal, we could invade at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us," commended Coach Allegri goalman Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," was the Yayu Touré, the backup of City.
We have to take experience from the League of Masters, and next time we try to make a better outcome.
Good-bye, Angelo, good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue the issue of immigrants, we should realise that the whole media shaking around is being managed by professionals.
According to the media's needs and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies that carry their parents on their hands on the dust roads of exodus.
And it causes a person - in a European person - automatically feeling guilty and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate kids, notice on the footage of boats coming to the Greek islands that the baby can't see that much!
Well, somehow, we've recently disappeared from television pictures of ships headed to Lampedus, refugees from the French border of Menton, whose beautiful promenades lie thousands of young men.
A lot of young black people.
And there were also pictures from Callais, where these people eat and the black men are waiting to be able to climb through the tunnel under La Manche.
I guess he doesn't care anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not make a special impression on Europe’s inhabitants.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it's kind of concealed that it's not just the unhappy children from Syria, but also the secreted - for the elders: fashionably educated - young men.
Their musculatures look like they're coming out of a fit center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on a private beach of the hotel.
No matter that she was private, she came to the beach suddenly a large group of cars.
But no hams.
And young blacks came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked into the beach, all the clothes in brand clothes and shoes, in their hands, as otherwise, smartphones.
That this is a private beach, they were not interested in, and the employees, Turks, Muslims!
They've settled all the beds.
Who didn't lie on him and was just in the sea had bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on their legs.
Then they rounded up the local beach bar and started breeding.
They settled the tables around, put themselves next to the sitting eaten and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children flew from the dining terrace somewhere to peace.
The incoming blackmen drinked beer straight from thirds - how did they throw empty bottles around themselves on the beach?
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they put the wine in the drink, also straight out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool - in brand swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, in the water screaming and yelling, mothers with children and pensioners terrifiedly escaped and in half an hour was no longer on the beach or in the pool.
Everyone's gone.
Regardless of whether a Christian or Muslim was a Christian.
The employees of the hotel were just afraid to talk about them.
The reader told me half-hlase tonight, "Have you seen the gold they wore on?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it out of work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about 20-centimeter massive gold cross on his neck.
And the women were like gold.
"There are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," said the waiter.
Drugs don't dispose of or use.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it was not that important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politicians were supposed to know first.
I don't think they know.
At that time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, it turns out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically-corrective politicians, as intellectuals, and the connected lobby and economically important groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - today the publicly recognised main power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, also the EU and television tops, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures about enthusiastic welcomes of refugees in Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow's TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but most importantly - ancient Germans - Muslims welcomed their privates.
For the long weeks, they were fooling in the Czech TV news, as they said, according to some research by the Germans, almost all for the arrival of the migrants.
But who was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms more information.
For example, famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public TV companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
It also reported our TV.
However, they secreted what happened on the second day in Germany: that in the English vote on the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of the Germans no longer wanted to take part in a survey of 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel, publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts of the multitude-culti's community have completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"Everything trying to do such a thing has completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she believed it did not testify to a strategy that allowed people from different cultural environments to live next to each other without integrating themselves. Today they were living here, and we were lying for a while that they would not stay that one day will disappear.
But that's not reality.
Multicultural approach, when we call ourselves that we just live happily next to each other, this approach failed.
Totally failed.
But Merkel may not have the strength to go against the mighty Germany and Europe, and above all, political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rising fast.
The Euroniemec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the MEP for the SPD, is the only one who allegedly has no graduation in the Europarlament - yes, it is the one that Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play a concentrate supervisor - as he has already demonstrated more than one minute.
It appears, particularly under the impression of the recent German politicians, that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
Note that, except for some, most of the European politicians do not support these statements, the nationals of countries who have been victims of Naziism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have tried for years, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past of aggressor and millions of murderers?
Are those right what they say in the soul of Germany is the devil's aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when all his strength stopped the attempts of the Greater Romans to control the entire center of Europe?
When did he say that the large German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess I did.
When he was removed, the first World War began to prepare.
The idea of Velkoniemec, which led Germany and Europe into two wars, which cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After attempting the Marxists to control the state, such as Rote Armee Fraktion, and after failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main sciences of Nazis, started to develop new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long defended the creation of German nationalism, so they have left all these fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for paradise for all, quietly supporting the old emperor and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better around the world, they have fully bowed to the side of the fighters against the heating of the planet, they have stopped the nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semite - so-called propallestinic - and anti-Slovakian current, considering all the Slavans as a difficult verbeage - since Karl Marx, who, after the parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
Also, as Schulz and German minsters show the last statements of the unobedient eastern states, the idea of leadership Germany.
Which must be listened without an excuse.
Otherwise, you're beating!
And when we mix into this, that immigrants are a very affective group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is behind this as always capital, especially German, which is compatible and which is the one that Germany actually controls most of Europe's countries through banks and the Union.
The sunflower dog first brought the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multi-clercuralism and brought them home today and perhaps brings millions of Muslims.
Who lured by the voices of the siren will soon be hit by the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they're going to be wrecked.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors by force again, a part of his people can again - but it seems to be a smaller part - ideologically defrauded, but ultimately, reality will come to it as always.
Is Germany gonna burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the arrivals of Islamists?
But do Muslims have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take local habits and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and the Germans follow the fear of Islamicism of their country?
What does it do to the Germans, and even Germany, when people rise up loud and publicly protest against the new Euro-force to Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has created in Europe with support for sunflower ideology, ideology of elite and, in principle, totalite, and its unsafe banks, is growing.
And because of uncomfortable negotiations against unobedient democratic Germans and all underlying and disobedient eastern neighbors, they can't get well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of climbers: scare them to death.
All you need to do is knock it down and a robust knock on you in a way that doesn't have to stop the weaker nature right now.
The resurrected head will wipe you well, and it will sink even sharply, to the way away, they will escort you (or rather drive away) an impenetrable seller and a resurrection statue.
Maybe it's a pity that a talking clap can't even be arranged.
Even with us, we could use a lot of guts and scumbags.
Pink (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And that's how it's located between the outdoor tiles near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expanzive weeds, but imaginably creates a nice impression about blooming.
The tiles are located between the outdoor tiles.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes the dryer environment, is easily adaptable, modest and undressed.
He creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth watching and taking photographs.
There is only a beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves, even with a purple escort.
Brazil’s pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to mediate women's knowledge of the importance of good food in breastfeeding using images of children who have been painting from the breast by showing unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply to infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to energy requirements, pregnant women and mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie income by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calories are not the only dietary measures to be followed by mothers.
Recent studies conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic production of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the Sabbaths, although Nine's trying to take over at Today Show
With Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry, in order to cover the costs of the leakage of the liberal guidance, it failed to create sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
The morning show Nine projected from national capital after the conviction of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with the host David Koch and Samanthou Armytage settled in London as a part of a week's long series of international television broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara waterfalls and Cancun.
It didn't seem that this tyranny depends so much on Aussie TV viewers because it recorded 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 broadcasters Today.
Today, a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was up to last Thursday (343,000).
Today in the last few months fills the Sunrise gap.
In August, 318,000 were averaged in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are good, thank you for asking!
Posted TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great message for Seven was an impressive debut of 800 words with the former Star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father who decides to move his two children into the coastal part of New Zealand, has an average of an impressive 1,219 million viewers.
The critics wondered if Thomson could pull a TV hit without Rafters Rebecca Gibney's star.
The result of last night shows clear "yes".
The X Factor of Seven left the strong 1,136 million viewers, thereby easily defeated The Block (838,000) and the TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed observations of the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), who presented Andrew O'Keefe's average was 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers — which was enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the other half of the incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had 620,000 on average.
Thanks to the decline in the rating of The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a series of Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect guy, but who's gonna choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unwillingly find out who won Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is concealed by an inconceivable secret.
And three girls who stay standing won't tell who the real one is that gets the rose eventually.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were left, they told us who won.
Sam Wood holds his tongue for teeth to the fourth finale
All three women of Lyricks were singing why Wood is a perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as a reason why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If not, so which gets Wood's final flower," their answers might work as a connector about who gets the heart of Bachelor.
As Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would best suit Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah's energy and Sam, I felt that they were sufficiently compatible and I still think it during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really rude woman, she's a lot of fun with her," she added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and there's a good chemistry between them.
They're good and well together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a nice couple.
For her alone, she claims that during his last visit home she realized that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not a game anymore - I opened his whole heart now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose when she wasn't with her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Snezena and Lana indefinitely.
Bachalor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and many teams asked after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches had Hayne sit down for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the convertity of the Australian rugbi league during the first kick out of the pitch during Tuesday winner 20:3 at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injured.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of eating the novices before the rest of the team, he could encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, said that Hayne was also encouraged by a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only take care of another game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he left the field after misleading and later said to the Australian Railway Duu Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start of career in NFL could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the tragedy to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in its own goal territory led to the three Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimír Putin will meet in discussions about homosexual rights
In 2003, the richest man of Russia Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in siberian ranves.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S.A. has become an immigrants who have committed to reimbursement of the property.
The two emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property was no longer possible to return, so the couple turned to the State's request for compensation under the Law on extra-soud rehabilitation.
First, the court granted them the amount requested, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeal court changed their claim by granting them only less than 90,000 crowns with a reference to that the amount of the refund is determined according to the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants have become the Supreme Court and originally summoned their defendant amount.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay off, was appealing to the U.S.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic terms that the refund granted in accordance with the applicable legislation - even though it constituted adequate compensation in relation to the derogated property - today only a breakdown of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of side-by-party participants in the restitution of legitimate persons who have helped their rights for at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to grant a refund before," explained the rapporteur, Mr Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S.A. stood on the side of the migrants.
"The ESC repeatedly expressed that general courts should proceed in restitutional matters so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted in the failure of legitimate persons and in order to always achieve the purpose of restoration of the law, i.e. the detriment of property damage caused by the acts of the former totalitarian State," said the judge.
Evita in the musical Study DVA now a creative Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišar, by the way, became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998 she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says, "Today, Evita's hardship hasn't balanced much."
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolon recommended her as the first lady of Argentina.
I saw Monča three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite a favourer of modern adjustments, but this one is simply particularly well-established.
"Režie Ondřej Sokola is original, relaxed and current," says Fišarová.
The thoughtful transmission of the musical gel between the two singers will be held at the Monika Absolon's birthday concert on September 27, from 19 hours at the Studio DVA Theatre.
In the evening, he's going to culminate with songs from Evito's musical.
The experience will certainly belong to the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (till your cry, Argentina!).
In the limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also take off from the director's pulse when he will be reinvented for filming Karl Roden as President Perón.
For reasons of public interest, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
Fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita shows Studio DVA theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the director Ondřej Sokola originally studied Monika Absolon.
By her side, Karel Roden appeared as president of Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with Czech texts Michael Prostějovský sounds in the submission of a live orchestra under the leadership of Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first entry in Spiral's theater.
4 people killed after the police fired rubber projectors for demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot the rubber projectors into a crowd of demonstrators against the design of a new state constitution, said the official on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmanda.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officer, states that more than 1000 demonstrators gathered before the police station and some threw stones and burn bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired it into the air before they went to the rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill, but traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, clearly caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern Nepal planina, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that they created a new province under the proposed new constitution, and reduced their political influence.
Other demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the creation of its own state.
From August 10, at least 40 people were killed in violent conflicts, including 11 policemen.
when four main political parties signed an agreement on the distribution of the country into the province — a great step towards the new constitution, but a very contested question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work in the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators have speeded up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in Kathmanda this week on the provisions of the Constitution's proposal and officials indicate that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We must definitely not panic now.
After the ice of the Master Litvínov, you couldn't handle even the home duel with the hokejists Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a catastrophic entrance to extraligia like a year ago?
I hope there's nothing like that coming back.

NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the largest Cape Verde Islands is likely to have 60 percent in the formation of tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, stated on Tuesday the American National Hurricane Center.
Another well defined low pressure system, about in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and Small Antilles, has also 60 percent probability in the emergence of tropical cyclon formation in the next two days, added weather prognoses with the location of Miami.
Google launched a campaign to select $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOGOGL.O) said that it triggers a campaign aimed at choosing $111 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European countries from the wars of perpetrated and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog a very unusual way.
A report on her blog published by the staff of Googlu Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience when she was a seven-year-old fled with her family from Kabul.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirsty, winter and fear,” said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is increasingly more families, like she has, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Physicians without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all contributions made via google.com/refugeerelief will double up to $5.5 million.
Europe faces the largest wave of refugees from World War II, most of them come from Syria, thrown by a four-year war, which only drove to 4 million people this year.
Many people run from the war of perverted Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetes, useful weight loss surgery could be
Benefits of weight loss of surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery of weight loss than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
"The death reports last long to see," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote the editor for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgerys use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric operations have proved to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the surveys have been conducted on humans with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the relationship of the weight raised to the height, is considered to be normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicates the overweight of the person and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from the study since 2007, which has dealt with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastrectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who have been mildly obese.
The average BMI between those who undergoed surgery decreased according to study from 31 to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained those who were not provided with surgical treatment of diabetes, approximately the same at the value of 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36% and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and partly only in about 2 percent of patients have been resolved for comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "sick" LDL cholesterol have also been demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors have found.
Researchers also monitored the patient's haemoglobin levels of A1c in the blood, reflecting the continuous blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best maintained under 7 percent, reports researchers.
After the operation, the mean value of haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which reflects at better levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), a higher decrease in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of diabetic remission (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life extension, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who undergoed a bariatric operation had about 29 percent more chances of survival in the next 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown improvement in survival between patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a calming result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This work is critical right here because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," reports without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously after the patient's BMI decrease between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to show people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that tightly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the nearest east.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for violence to be terminated in the home countries of refugees.
Dalajlama dealt with an issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech when opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit of the Great Britain.
He claimed that, under the present circumstances, human interest should be given to the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries, whatever admissible, to the refugee crisis, was inappropriate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended the efforts of Germany and Austria to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring real peace and real development, especially through education of these Muslim countries," stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with violence questions, Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits of George Bushe after 9/11 of terrorist attacks and claims that "the U.S. violent reaction caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in the letter of President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," said Dalylam.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have had an ambulance agent for the last 4 years
The toxicological centres around the United States reported almost 400 percent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years, which swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the head of the Georgia toxicological centre, the number of ambulances in children up to 12 years of age reported to the jed control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children get more often on these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children to be taken to an emergency," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink the sanitation measure intentionally while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
The videos on YouTube show teenage girls how to drink an ambulance because of cheap habits.
They allegedly mixed an ambulance with oral water containing alcohol for stronger drinks.
Younger children can be attracted to attractive smells.
"The children don't think about it hurting them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (resolutions) are those that are perfumed.
Ambient ambulances with strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The Sanitation measure contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, a number of heels may mean alcohol poisoning.
"One of highly concentrated alcohol," said the station Fox 4 at Kansas City medical director of the control center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
A glass of whiskey wouldn't let you just lay down, but people leave these sanitation equipment outside and when they get kids, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently wiped up to four cubits of an ambulance agent with a smell of strawberries and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in adults, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah pronounced the insolent words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
The doctors watched her overnight at a separate childhood hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell down because of alcohol and hit her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for sanitation resources from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the swallowing of the ambulance, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Healthcares believed that the product contained methanol, a fatal agent, rather than an ethanol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "bacterial" teachers by distributing antibacterial products after the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation resources and has forbidden their presence in the room.
The police judged the dream plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Footnote: No discrepancy in the Celtic team
Griffiths bagatelizes the talks of the Celtic dishonor while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it over.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new backup of January will infringe the unity of the team.
Dons increases their head start over Celtic by 5 points
The Penalt of the first half in the submission of ADAMA Rooney provided Aberdeen with a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which resulted in Dons's five-point lead between them and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talking about non-compliance
This situation has caused rumors about the failure in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, which insists that he and his co-workers do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a fight with Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Sufficiency in the Scottish title rival of boring Netherlands - de Boer
The former guardian of the Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claimed that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry among them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador of Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers there anymore.
People here don't just talk about getting the Rangers back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
The old company's matches have great tension, and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things back to the good, bind Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little stumbled, but the Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the next fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now is on top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about the current thing.
We're in the same way, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about the ice backup.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he has already identified some of his January targets, the Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford says, "The Ledn Transition Window is very different from the summer's."
Players who come in the summer have the whole preseasonal period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage occurs by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celticu transfer target suggests retirement
The attacker Swansea Michu, who was connected to Celtic in a transgressive window, suggested that he could retire after his contract with Swansea.
A 20-year-old shooter has been in trouble with an ankle susceptible for two years and couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the wardrobe and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the Collum judge who was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his statement and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoid Tynecastleu
Hard-headed Hibbe was strictly smuggled after he admitted that he sang a song with a text focused on the former Hearts Rudolf Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the area of Roserburn in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"The attacker said, "I can safely say I won't go back to Tynecastleu unless it's in Celtic's jersey."
The Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donlly
Simon Donlly insists that the Dundee United Board still believes in remedying the situation with the current team management - but admits that the fall on the field has to end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy again for action," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes likes to be a "great victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdean team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies to get the seven league victory at each other and a five-point lead before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes says, "There's no team who won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of games."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while the total unemployment of the UK is increasing
The total number of unemployed in the UK grew by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period remains unchanged in Scotland.
The rate of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 percent higher than the UK (5.5 percent), as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 over a period of three months, the number of workers now stopped to 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased to 74.0 percent during the quarter - which is 73.5 percent over the British average.
State secretary of Scotland David Mundell said in his comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has set the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made a historical decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment increased while unemployment has declined.
Why I was witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will follow the death of a man.
If this happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the gallery in the chamber of the death of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I first received an invitation through my best friend in January, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
When it comes that day, I'm getting worried about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America and because there are often more requests than free places, a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever will be chosen will follow the entire execution uninterested.
I can't do that.
I'll sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends and create a special connection to him through the months of calls and one two and a half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook block and I won't be able to record what I'll see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter for compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of a breeder as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admits that "it could formulate better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell a story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help against the death penalty procedures.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more information about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I'm not gonna repeat all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of a crime.
But I believe there's a lot of probability he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that enough evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I will be watching his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
To this end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I like to die with no useless death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he set the man out of Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrh that runs away from the police didn't come out after he got into a shallow mud water just meters from a policeman who tried to inviolably convince him to return to the shore.
The Canning Vale police were summoned in an incident beyond Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw a suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and repeating'I'm not going out, just come and get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and the negotiating police."
"People sometimes try to do funny things while running away," Castledine said.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove the car into the trunk to avoid the bus and tried to swim over the river Swan.
His efforts were vain, but inspired by the locals to start planning the biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the races
Peeter Moody accused organizers of Racing Victoria that they tried to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and the Department of Integrity Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratch of Lady Tatai in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation with regard to Lidarin's positive cobalt extract, which can't explain.
He bit his tongue about spy charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "suched grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it'll come out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live with consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go up with my head and make sure the owners think I'm doing the best for them.
When they start thinking the opposite, I shouldn't be coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do in my license after that.
Previously, Moody released a bomb in his conversation for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"At 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after a question - and they offered him a job in my stables for finding out the information about the things that they're doing in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information because they're trying to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's happening personally?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and ensure that people outside the coach position take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt what I'm saying will give them the material to think.
But I got to the point when I don't care, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them, and I will carry the burden on them to make their decision.
I have my family's support and I can leave.
The coach frustration levels have increased with a long-term investigation due to the cobalt, including Lidara, and the recent scratches in it have raised the feeling that "he could have hours of his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the unfamiliar champion Black Caviar, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "scrutiny" after the horses were applied to the legs of a clay hull or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against race rules.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone in my team accidentally put a mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened too.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of hulls on the day of the race to which organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who ran away was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobram and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airborne transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injury after hit the car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said the motorist left without stopping and helping a wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be accused of not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in a hospital stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns the strike to the rivals because of wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "determination of the plan" two NRL primitives.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said that the judge allowed Storm players to "wrestl" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the Sydney Qualification Final at Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a lightly hidden note on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game as a "show" rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not too big for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they were focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased confidence because his team is criticized by two coach managers, which may mean that they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It still comes - I don't remember that Trent Robinson would talk about wrestling when we were beaten by 24-2," he said on Wednesday Bellamy.
I can guarantee that in the last year we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques, we've only put emphasis on contact during the procedure, and that meant a turnover for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and apparently he's been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy misrepresented Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's team, St George-Illawarra Dragons, won the premiership in 2010 by playing "nude" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday game as exciting as ours, too," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of a game that seems disrupting to him, especially his young addicts with their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two bookmarks like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play such style.
It raises more confidence in me because they say such things because they're worried about fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were in the Storm and Roosters struggle than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two other attempts in our game, but is it an exciting football?
Or are the breaks and the unscrupulous attempts that are interesting?
I think it's an agenda.
If they mention us, that means we'll definitely meet at the stage again.
Storm has a break this weekend and they won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be available from morning next Tuesday.
Serbian man got bailed $200,000 for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life for holding 40 pounds of cocaine, smuggled from Queensland, got bailed on $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years) was one of the five men who arrested the federal police last month searching for 100 kilograms of the Solay yacht that came from South America through Vanuatu and enrolled in Coomera in August.
Maximumovice was seen when meeting with the accused at the port during the morning, and later met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for the possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice put a defense on the fact that there is no evidence that he would own all the quantities and that he could be in a cafe by accident and innocence.
Judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan believed that the Maksimovic had escaped.
He's got a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the midst of the court.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the Crown case.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovice together offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the stringent statements of both persons, it is obvious that the deposited bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were evidently insufficient, because the defendant did not come further in court, he warned.
Maximumovice was bailed on condition that he would give up both the Australian and the Serbian passport, he would report to the police every day and comply with the curriculum from 18 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure the pedophiles to send images
Pedofil used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then he signed up for her on her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate photos of children who sent him another user.
The girl woke up and found out she missed her phone, and then found him in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she warned her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police joined and saw five photos, then analytical computers found an address and discovered a "znepokojing" search on the web using expressions to search for immortal images of children.
Hogg then told the cops that his reason was to put pedophiles on the Internet before he "suspected he was a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was addiction - that he was dependent on the distress of people.
He admitted that he was a computer searcher, but he claims he was just trying to pretend that he was a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked for his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another one.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He said he was drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When a girl found a message on her phone, he called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the immortal pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residence at Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty to file a lawsuit on the adoption or release of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, broke the bail conditions on 25 January and did not come to court hearing on 24 March of this year.
Gregor Sim's lawyer asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders, because he can argue that there was no "no fundamental sex subtext in his act."
The Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the judgment on October for reporting to social workers.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but was held in custody before the hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwský Robert Mugabe presented a bad speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, earlier this year, fell on the stairs leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in the social media.
The opening parliament was also contradicted by the claims of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats by killing that warned them against Mr Mugabe's whistle during his speech.
Last month, they whispered him and provoked him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Chairman of the Mission of the Move for Democracy Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies adopted text messages on their mobile phones with warnings not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that doesn't appear, but it's called 'death'," said to the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that the immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as they come out of Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is not working.
The Chief said that the party that Morgan Tsvangirai leads has "happiness" about threats to Members.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard repeals 25 000 to 30 000 jobs in its efforts to restructuring and saving the cost of business services.
HP later this year will be divided into two companies quoted in the exchange and separated by computer and printer trade from its faster growing business operations of company hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about 2,7 billion and the start will take place in the fourth quarter, says HP.
"This restructuring activity will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," states Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and Chairman of the Board, who will be headed after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than is today HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops that will help businesses to move to a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate society, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have a company's annual income statement of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing uncompetitive integrated technological solutions" by the company.
This will result in the distribution of the company, which in 1930 were founded by graduates from the University of Stanford Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "Silicon Valley's birthplace."
HP has been undergoing massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP move, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest of this sector based on belief that the closely specialized company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says the teammates have to get injured for Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized for Wilshere that he is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four other English games and, from history perspective, his involvement in the next summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
A great shame of this most recent problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strong after ankle injury and then got back into the former form during the preseed.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the wound he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
The survey carried out by the Prime Minister Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different Wilsher injury since he had his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he played only in 65 games of Arsenal from the total number 157:
From the wider perspective for Arsenal, it means that in six out of eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost the most days for injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the enchanted circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of reported injury will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back after the injuries, you have a vulnerable period, the time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begins the campaign in Lize champions at the Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, that means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to enter.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stage in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after they held the "unthreatening" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees of Richter at the Wednesday night.
That was the 19th year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions, when he surrendered against Monaco and remains far away hope that the club will lead to the first victory in the European cup.
"This deployment is huge," says Wenger.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedial show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
Absence of similar views in various shows is in the eye, especially given the need for men to open more desperate than ever, with regard to suicide between young men within 15 years.
In 2013 it was the only biggest cause of death in men 20-45 years of age in Great Britain and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In trying to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) year 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this fight there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the damaged had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends presents half the chance to experience mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be attainable first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on the style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need has doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This surface success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and her maker explained recently, money really won't buy more luck.
The beauty of the show, friends, was the source of this thought to him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that have glowed through friendly interactions.
Joey's humour and Chandler's frequent victims, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all preys of knowledge, that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel incapable of communicating with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up the problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will rise in my memory when I'm trying to offer a longer-term mechanism of compensation.
He emphasizes little moments in male friendship.
With regard to my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in desperate times, but long-term support must come from closer, from the network of friends and family.
So if this weekend you're going to FrendsFest organized by the Comedy Central station, why not take your friends to a drink to Central Perk, where the interior for the celebration will be completely recast.
Or if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what difference your friendship can do.
Series Friends will be sent to Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - whole 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG suck Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavanim after shooting the gate against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in Lize Masters and helped PSG defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani scored both in the Tuesday match, and Paris Saint-Germain started their trip in Lize Masters with the final 2-0 victory against Malma on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the gate less than four minutes after his debut in Lize Masters and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they threw several chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the head gate in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not focused only on qualifications in the discharge wheels, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinals that they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it was not the classic performance of the Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic team was in front of the prodigal gate and later he was replaced against his home team and club in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In Lize Masters, it is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and look comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things that we have to improve with the season procedure," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injuries as one of the three changes in the PSG team, who spent the 2-2 draw this weekend with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was swept by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was labeled as a man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level after the passage from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why when he ran to Marc Verratti's pass at Malma's defense and a beautiful end sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the remote corner of the gate.
However, if anyone expected to start a magnificent PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in playoff and got into this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the basic structure and five defenders and two overlapped guards were a tough rival.
But besides the Nikola Djurdjice shot, which just missed the remote corner of Kevin Trapp's gate in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves looked at the benefit of the attack by bad passages and miserable ending, which was not good either from Ibrahimovice, who was unable to fire even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shooting arrived in the network shortly after the second half of Cavani.
However, he appeared a lot more suitable when he came to prepare a chance for his colleagues and it was just from his credit card when Di Maria sent a torque shot that ended in Wiland's gate after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game, thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan headline sent the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the entry from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make something out of the game, and only the excellent Wiland's operation from the very vicinity ruined David Luiz's hope and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the alternate Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The team coach Malmo Age Hareide admitted that the PSG were about a class above his team, Nor said, "Our last game in Lize Masters took place in December last year."
We've only played Swedish league since then, which is not at the same level.
Qualification matches are not enough.
A hat down for Paris.
It was a wonderful game for them.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion for selling shares
The mining gigant Glencore with its registered office in Switzerland, which was affected by the collapse of commodity prices, earned on Wednesday $2,5 billion from the sale of shares within its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in his statement that she sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, faces commodity prices, as Chinese slowdown reduces the economy's demand and ignites sparks of destruction across the markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore shares to the top at the London stock market in early morning.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131,60pm on the FTSE 100 index that opened by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore discovered last week that sales of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of the wider plans to reduce their debt $30 billion, which accumulated about a third.
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 cents per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So 1,3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
The concerns about the prolongation of Chinese growth decreased the cost of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi in Washington will take place on 25 September in response to Barack Obama at the visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, said the report.
The American president and first lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his bride Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the conversations are over.
"President Xi's visit is an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the US and China and encourage cooperation in addressing problems in international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity to debate both states' conflicts constructive debate," reports.
Xi, whose first visit was announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for the United Nations Shield meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with disputed problems, including Washington's fears of alleged cyberspionage of China and its growing aggressivity in the waters of the Jihočín Sea.
How the refugee crisis broke Schengen space.
The emergency lights fired by Germany were far from the European crew, but it's already pushing the ship to change the course, wrote the French journal Le Figaro.
The European Union decided to deal first on Monday with the issue of refugees: rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters into the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than fight for the future distribution of refugees according to quotas on the basis of the quantity which is increasingly distant in reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, asked 25 of 28 EU countries to divide 160,000 refugees, the Ministers of the Interior of the Member States had changed their priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, first it is necessary to filter those who come today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Efficient management of the EU's external borders is necessary for the management of migration," emphasises the text of the debated ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that he is at risk in his next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but does not lose its decisiveness and increase pressure.
It renews border checks, especially with Austria, but without blocking the tide of those seeking asylum in this country.
Central power makes it clear that there is no free movement in Europe without it.
As evidence it has already served that Austria and Slovakia have joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, even though with different intensitys.
Hungary has made it a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures shall be permissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a dominate effect, he sees blind as well.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of compulsory input controls in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already gone to inland.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière intensely discussed this during their private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but there is a stiffness.
In Italy, the non-official statistics have already been registered and identified by removing fingerprints of two-thirds of new incoming drivers.
The Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory, because it fears more than others to not remain camps on its beds where refugees would be accumulated to its account.
The real black hole remains in Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on his islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as much as it has recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are true asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they passed over the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge greening hole.
The athens that are still in financial disruption and waiting for the new government have put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan road and the source of now common concerns for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The Juncker Commission promises that the introduction of inspection points will take place as soon as possible, but it has not provided any number or date.
"The challenges faced by Greece apply to the whole of Europe," said the EU's Interior Ministers on mobilisation on Monday.
It is therefore about deploying the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece extend its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"The need for adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the Ministers for approval.
In terms of law, the last word Athens will continue.
The question of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the eight-advantages, as well as the second round, resurrected the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which, at the beginning of the year, brought up by the Commission of Juncker and the European Parliament and which strongly supported Angela Merkel and the French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was preserved in the text approved by the majority of eight-year-olds on Monday.
But as political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only strong promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the hectic summit of the EU, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists that killed the avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who survived as one of the affected eight groups.
Previous media reports said it was Polka.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with severe leg injury in the area of the thigh bone.
The dead formed mostly the 40ths according to the AFP.
"Safe action is over, also the victims were taken to identify Briancon," said the prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
Unfortunately happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measured 4015 metres.
"The naked avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said the chief of the rescuers Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, about 3900 metres of height, the eight-member group had a huge amount of snow.
Today, the weather service did not warn in the area before the weather.
Trpiovský before the match with Bragou: Finally, the true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpiszovský, during his premiere in the cups, he managed to pass through the European League in front of the basic group with the team to enjoy the real Europe.
The Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist, and according to the coach, he wants to make her his game style.
After all the nerves in the eliminating fears, where every goal and every situation could cut you off on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six matches.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every incased goal, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just a double match.
"I look forward to it and it's true Europe, it was only a qualification before," said Trpiovský at the press conference.
Brag thinks it's a top team.
It will be very active, have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may just be harder even that he doesn't have a name like that, but he has a player who suspected of Manchester giving three goals.
"It's a great whole at the top level of teams," said Trpiovský.
But Brag doesn't consider it clear.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have also shown that we are strong at our stadium, and that we want to confirm," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels of this season only the introductory Superpohár in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can also force Braze to make its style.
We're waiting for a team that's going to be strong on the ball at the same time it's not typically disciplined for them.
They play from the 4-4-2 schedule with a rapid transition to the attack phase.
"He is a very heavy opponent, although we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," said Trpiovský.
Before that, we studied a lot of rivals, which has helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to practice.
"And we certainly want to, even if it's very difficult to play according to our notes," he added coach.
Student films will control Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their work in the competition this year on the 15th year of the International Festival of Student Films in Sand.
Four dozens of them, which the committee of students and teachers sent to the final, will be displayed from 15 to 18 October in the cinema of Portyč.
The best of them will choose the international jury, said the spokesman of the festival Jakub Charvat.
Every year the festival has its special topic, which comes from the festival sounds.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's festive evenings Richard Blumenfeld is planning to connect the elements of television, film and theatre creation.
"And of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in this year's flank," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by the international jury, in which, for example, the winner of the last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and the British producer Hemant Shard.
The festival organizers, like each year, prepare an accompanying programme.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turbošanson Group We fly?, play band Zrní, or for example Petra Hapková with a recital Life on the bar.
The festival will host two photographs exhibitions.
The first graduate of the sandy film school and the prestigious award holder, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition will draw closer to the atmosphere in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
The film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the songs of Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the statue of Jan Novotný will baptize his new book of 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy to live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint bonds and film craft," said the speaker.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, attend several auditions at once and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of a private higher film school in Sand.
Her founders, her husbands, Vladan and Miloň Terč, organized their first year in 1997.
He was held once every two years by the sixth year.
When CK is bankrupt, insurance undertakings are to pay full claims to clients.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients when travel agencies are bankrupt at full amount.
She decided on that on the Wednesday of the House when she approved a revised amendment of the Act on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to pay insurance against bank guarantees according to the prerequisite aimed at assessing the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to cover the claims of clients even above the agreed limit disagree.
The Ministry of Local Development continues to adapt, argues with consumer protection.
The insurance firms have threatened to end the security of the travel agencies against the crack when the novel will be valid.
But the proposal also criticizes travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll either have to quit or leave abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karla Šlecht (NO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not euro-computer.
She pointed out this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client was entitled to repay full money regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, pointed out by Šlecht.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be realistic," the vice-president of the TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The banking guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"The travel agencies will have to end their activities or move abroad," warned Kalousek.
Member of the Presidency of the Association of Czech travel agencies and agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalousk’s concerns on the basis of a survey between the CK Member States did not agree.
"Stop showing us lobbying insuranceen," he said.
The statement of insurance companies does not consider Okamura relevant, there is no official written statement in that sense.
However, they are finding out whether the travel agencies will be involved, which according to Okamura is not a problem.
She also warned Jana Fischerová (ODS), which referred to the opinion of the Competition Association of the Czech travel agencies, and her party colleague, Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Fischer's travel agents will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," judges Fischer.
Her proposal to release the disputed passage of the House has not been approved.
Even Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not go back to the committee with a proposal for alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip drew attention to travel agencies that he believed could jeopardise consumers.
In view of the judgment of the Constitutional Court, the rapporteur, Mr Berdych, withdraws its proposal to limit the liability of the insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance transactions would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not originally propose a minimum of four million tour insurance for travel agents offering tours by air transport and a million tour limit for offices selling bus tours, for example.
The border will remain on 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the limit of insurance performance will have to be such that, in the event of the accident of the travel agency, it covers all customer claims.
Norma and after the adjustments provide that travel agencies will have to introduce new tours for sold tours which the travel agency organizes.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, data on management and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Committee on Public Administration shall also count on further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to supply to them every month data on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of sold tours and the amount of advances and tolls for tours and vouchers to them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has not complied with one of the legal obligations against the insurance company, it shall invite it in accordance with the prerequisites to remedy, or it will be able to prohibit the conclusion of new contracts in the event of a breach of the obligation to jeopardise the interests of customers.
The new company also has to adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will contain a report on the use of state money in the last year, a financial plan of expenditure and a view of the next two years.
According to the Association of the Legislator, he didn't think about what happens if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It won't be allowed to organize tours, and the clients who bought the tour before the insurance was ordered, so they'll lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even disappear, even though its management was in a good condition.
One of the options to deal with such travel agencies will be a plea for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only operate in our market as an agency, said the Vice-President Jan Papež.
Although the draft novel is also included in the Banking Guarantee Institute, it is unthinkable that it cannot be implemented in practice, as the banking guarantee cannot sound to an unrecorded amount.
In addition, according to the association, a change in the current practice de facto is unnecessary.
In the horizon of two years, the whole law will need to be recast in view of the new EU Directive.
On the Czech market, it now operates a total of 942 active travel agencies.
Only three CKs ended this year.
Tourist travel agencies will sell tours of about 20 billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be advocated to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of runners to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after dealing with the German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, she reappointed the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU between the countries of the eighty-year-olds.
We need to help the refugees from where they leave, or where they are abstaining after leaving the country.
I am expecting a signal from the European Union that we are precluding dignified conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal might also be a higher financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"Company countries also support the German government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to the European countries," said Merkel.
The Earth Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke in this context at the press conference said that all the EU countries expect real solidarity.
The allocation of runners in the EU on the basis of quotas for a long time denies Czech Republic, inter alia.
Merkel and Woidke also said to speed up the asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know if they have a chance to stay here as soon as possible.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin faster with the integration of foreigners, said the Branibor Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of the runners serves to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
There will be a need for more teachers to make refugees manage the German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we can integrate the runners, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon bails the diversity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted Effie Brown's African amateur filmmaker during the discussion of diversity, claiming that it was not necessary in the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project Greenlight interrupted the actor obsessed with the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we're talking about diversity, you're doing it by cinema, and not by circling the show," says Damon.
Shocked, reacted badly Brown with disbelief and accelerated "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments on Martian got on the broadcast.
Damon and Brown joined a common famous producer of Ben Affleck and brothers Farrelly to discuss the finalists show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think whoever is the director, as they treat Harmony," said Brown at the beginning.
The only black guy who's a hooker that packs a white pimp.
The manufacturer of the Drahé White People was prosecuting the finalists of Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their regime "to finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion went out, the social media exploded in a distress with Damon's comment.
The Twitter user, MrPooni, expressed anger on writing video, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black man in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is OK that it hurts."
Tweet has earned more than 5000 retweets and 4,000 leafs since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at the moment when the exact racial representation in the media is in the forefront of the social debate.
After killing a teenage Michael Brown white policeman in 2014, Black Lives Matter's movement gained national effect and pushed on a lawmaker and authority to abstain discriminatory practice against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made a hit on the movement while he was nominated in the category of Album of the year during the transmission of Grammy prices.
"Albes are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent Black Lives Matter movement was presented in his reply to the question of the personality of Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leader.
Damon has recently been reported to the list of riders, producers and mogules media, who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the view of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation, or has already met the Pope, it is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
A professional climber and picoli Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In a competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the contestants failed to overcome any obstacles on the line.
During the final season this year, two men fought for the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb for more than 220 m long lines.
Britten graduated the climb first and it became the first competitor in American Ninja Warrior, who survived the excitement of 4 sections, but Caldiero survived it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the newsE! News right after his hard-drawn victory and it was to know that he was still in shock of winning the main price worth $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never earned more than $10.000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to my win.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's gonna be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on the course of the finale and on why Britten won no reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor who finished the track.
For by the rules the money belongs to the fastest person to finish the track.
“If the track participates in more contestants, the win will be the one with the best time,” said Weed.
Although the profit of the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don't think he'd have had a grudge in him.
He's glad he succeeded in achieving what he did.
He's got a warm acceptance from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero for his children and his wife."
Geoff said to me: “If he was supposed to be someone who could defeat me, I'm glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will start filming in spring 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just passed by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a pink garden walk.

The fighter of the Tigers Victor Martinez hit three times and made two circulations and his first withdrawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point match since the last June game in which he hit four times in the Seattle Mariners fight.
“He turned himself into it nicely,” said Ausmus.

Byron Buxton's medieval fielder got the shift due to two points on the left side of the field.

Plouffe has already acquired a 27 run through two meters in this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer got two download points, and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this right-hand has eliminated Sana to three overtimes.
Detroit took advantages and got points in Phil Hughes' game.
The tigers have gained three circulations in the first two shifts against the right-hand man who has entered the game for more than a month's break due to inflammation of the muscles.
"I certainly didn't imagine this start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift, I felt I was doing better."
After he resisted the first shift, Hughes released one point to the second metallisers of Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for J.D. Martinez's right fielder took out Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the meths.
Victor Martinez broke his series 0-21.
The third Nick Castellanos tracked him with a point on the right side of the playground and scored another circulation, but Victor Martinez was thrown away when he tried to run to the third base.
The tigers added in the second shift when James McCann and Anthony Gose scored two and also one point and a score of 3-0 on the score board.
"It put us in our knees," said the manager of the Twins Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball too well, but he got him to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up in the third shift without points and replaced him by the right-hand A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran off three meters, got six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right tiger, the match ended with the pain in the right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews will take care of him, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of injured thanks to the tight muscles in the shoulder since mid-August, should be held in the medieval match.
Sancheze will replace Daniel Norris' left handwriting, who will return after the injuries and go against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was exchanged for David Price's left thrower, he's scored 1-1 to 4 matches.
Since August 20th, however, he hasn't played for a strained muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play the third mutual game at the Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) the Minnesoth left whisperer Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) stands.

The Head of the Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the mobilisation of border control policy, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the residence system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up in which sectors and undertakings outside the investment limits are identified.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programmes.

In the Karlovy Vary, a new bed department may be created.
According to deputy hejtman of the Karlovarian Region of Jakub Wowk (ČSSD) the current capacity of the spa departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the country is sufficient and the sub-modification should be made on the basis of an agreement between departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to extend care in the region.
For example, the surgical department could develop centres of one-day surgery, where, according to the set concept, the performance of surgical fields that do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals workplaces focused on day surgery should be, so far it is not clear.
The Charles Vary hospital skin department could again develop a laser center with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an anaphylical centre that would take care of patients with brain disabilities who are in vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such a facility in the hospital Island, where similar care exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovarian region, is subsequent care beds, especially beds The treatment of long-term patients (LDN), whose capacities in Nejdku are insufficient and should be closely linked to the acute beds.
Part of this device should work as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the following care beds are missing mainly in the hospital of Karlovy Vary.
There you can use the abandoned building after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovarian region, socially health beds are absent with the focus on Alzheimer’s disease treatment.
These beds are lacking throughout the Republic, so it could also serve for other countries as the so-called Alzheimercenter.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds for which funding of European subsidies will be released.
"One beds that will follow the areas of supecialised care and will create space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedure," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
