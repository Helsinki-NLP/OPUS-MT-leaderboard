Members of Parliament Welsh are worried that 'just like a doll'
Some members of parliament were impressed when rumors surfaced that their calling will be changed to MWP (members of Parliament Welsh).
This was the result of an attempt to change the name of Parliament Welsh.
Members of parliament from all political backgrounds are worried that they will become a laughing matter for people.
Members of parliament from a Labour party said their group was worried because it was "warning Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
Members of Parliament from the Plaid party also said that all members were "unhappy" and offered other suggestions.
An conservative Welsh said his group had "an open mind" about the change, but MWP and Muppet were so close, he said.
In this case, the letter "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the English word "u" in Yorkshire.
The Parliament Council, which drafts a law to introduce current changes, said: "Of course only members of parliament will have the final say on the summons of the House of Representatives."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave Parliament Welsh the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations about the bill, with many supporting the call for Parliament Welsh.
Regarding the names of members of parliament, the Commission's mind was that MP Welsh or WMP, but the MWP was the most supportive option when asked about the people's opinions.
It seems that members of parliament have other suggestions, but the head of the presidential officer, Elin Jones, may be confused by the consensus process, which should propose the reform bill in recent weeks.
The reform law also mentions some changes in the methodology of the conference, such as the rules on the removal of members of parliament from their seats and the formation of commissions.
When members of parliament are discussing the bill, they can finally cast their votes on the name they will be named.
Voters in Macedonia cast their ballots during a referendum on the change of the country's name
Voters will choose Sunday if their country's name will be changed as "North Macedonia's Republic."
The country's decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, is one of the reasons for this referendum.
The Athènes authorities have long confirmed that the name of their northern neighbours is detrimental to their territory, so they have ignored the request of the latter for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes popular demands to change the name, said he felt that the vote did not exist.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change was only in exchange for integration into the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Culture St. Martin silent while church is facing war in Harlem
“From history, the elders told me that all corners of the street included bars and churches,” said Mr. Adams.
"Today, this doesn't happen anymore."
He said that I understood how the bar was going to disappear.
"People's communication methods have changed a lot now," he says.
“It’s over the years that the bar is being used as a regular resort for people.”
For the church again, he is worried that the money they received from the distribution will not last as the church's leaders thought, "so long or later they will return to their roots."
The church itself, he says, could be replaced by a building with a rented room, where people will be covered with these kinds of people who don't care about the remaining sacred sites in the area.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, “so it’s certain that these churches will simply accelerate the day when they’ll close because most of the people who live there will not be sure that they’ll join the church.”
The two churches were founded by white church members, before Harlem was a city full of black people – a large city in 1870, and became St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist church that was formed there was left in the 1930s.
When that happened, a group of black believers gathered nearby to retrieve the house as their property.
Rev. John Howard Johnson led the black church that took St. Martin, the pastor led residents to avoid shopping for the retailers at 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, because they prevented the hiring of black workers or the development of blacks.
The house was badly damaged by the fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson’s church managed to rebuild it, they separated the bells.
The Rev. David Johnson, supported by Father Johnson and succeeded him in St. Martin, was proud to call the bell "small bell."
The expert who played the bell in July gave a different name: "Cultural resonance" and "a historic musical instrument without a substitute."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first child bell ever appointed by black musicians in the world, Diionio A. Lind, who moved to play the bell of a bigger child in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin no longer wanted someone to replace him.
In recent months, St. Martin's case has been in a state of panic due to the succession of buildings and construction companies, some brought to church by the secular authorities, and others by the diocese episkopaly.
The Council of Church wrote to the diocese – an office of the head of the church, with secular leaders – in July expressing concern that "the diocese is trying to transfer the expenses to" church councils, but no church council has entered the contract with the developers and construction companies sent by the diocese.
Some churchgoers complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy in exile in Californie was bitten by sharks
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark bite on Saturday in Californie while hiding for hours on the day when the season opened for hunting hours, authorities said.
The incident occurred at 7 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's account of KSWB-TV in San Diego, they had been in hiding for about half an hour on Saturday morning hearing the boy screaming for help, and a number of them quickly gave him a boat to approach him and pull him out of the water.
I thought he was so happy that he got an hour off, Hammel said, but then he realized that he was shouting "I was bitten!"
I'm bitten!'
Her remains are completely blacked out," Hammel discovered when she arrived near the boy.
"I called for a loud break out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel says.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported to be in critical condition.
It's unclear what kind of shark was biting it.
In an interview with the press, Capt. Larry Giles said that people in the area have found a shark in the past few weeks, but it's not the kind of bitling people.
The upper part of the victim's body is heavily injured by bits, said Mr Giles.
Authorities have closed the coast to Poto Beach from Casablad to Swami's in Eciitas for 48 hours due to investigation and safety.
There are more than 135 species of sharks common in this area, says Mr Giles, but most of them are not supposed to bite people.
sainabury's strategy insists on entering the UK's fashion market
Fistosbury's has come to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, using a designer-like design center similar to supermarkets and special designer.
In the midst of the strict emphasis on finding space in the US-based fashion market worth 2.8 billion Livres, which is growing as the fashion and furniture market decreases, more cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be transported to other stores if it seems successful.
At the same time that supermarkets seek ways to use TV stores, the most old micro-ondes and furniture have come this design investment.
The Mindsbury's said it will double the size of the fashion store, whose number will reach 3,000, and will find brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweerman and Dr. PawPaw, for the first time.
Varietys like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get a larger space and carry similar brands in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also exhibits all kinds of goods for maintaining the appearance of bactika in order to give special attention to vegetarian products – according to an increasing demand from shopping youth.
In addition, the retailer Fragrace Shop will also test the appointment of two special vendors in the Satosbury district, the first to be opened in Croydon, south of London last week, and the second will be opened at the end of this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people choose to shop on the Internet and buy less food every day in the city market, supermarkets are forced to make great efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director-General of Mindsbury's, said their store will become more similar to supermarkets as supermarkets try to counter retailers such as Aldi and Lidl through more services and products beyond food.
Many people have already set up Argos's shop, and since he bought the two stores two years ago, he says he has increased the sale of everyday goods and increased profits from the stores he bought.
The old attempt by the supermarket to provide a new life to the field of design and medicine has been thwarted.
In the early 2000s, Mindsbury's tried to invest with Boots, but the relationship with the distribution of funds obtained by the doctor in his supermarkets was broken.
The new strategy came about three years ago when Thinksbury's 125 million Livres sold to Celesio, owner of the network Lloyds Pharmacy, the network of 281 pharmacys.
He said Lloyds will have a role in this process, adding a broader series of products to the high-sized leather brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Mr. Paul Mills-Hicks, head of marketing at Mindbury's, said: "We have completely changed the appearance and experience that comes from the place where we design and design to make our clients better.
We also used extra money for fellow graduates of special training, who are available at any moment to suggest.
We have an appropriate share of the needs of everyone in us and because of the attractive and appropriate public space, we have become an inevitable place for designing beauty, changing the old version of shopping."
Peter Jones was 'fiercated' when Holly Willoughby nullified the 11 million Livres agreement
Peter Jones, the most well-known player of Dragons Den, was shocked that TV presenter Holly Willoughby refused the 11 million Livres deal with his business in living gear, because he preferred to focus on his new contract with Marks and Speccer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for Truly furniture and furniture brands.
People said that the two trades are similar to the Goop brand that Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The host of the program This Morning, now 37 years old, has been on Instagram claiming that he has resigned from the deal.
Peter Jones, the most well-known Dragons Den player, was enraged by Holly Willoughby's latest take on the lucrative life parts company – instead focused on the new contract he had with Marks & Specncer and ITV.
Jones was said to be "deeply angry" when the most paid TV presenter admitted at a Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of the big company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that as a result of his new contracts – up to 1.5 billion Livres – she had no time left for Trul’s brand of furniture and furniture.
This trade was equated with a Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was supposed to double Willoughby’s wealth estimated to be 11 million Livres.
On a private plane, Jones, who left Britain for one of his resorts, told Instagram, now 37-year-old Willoughby will leave Truly.
One source said: "Truly is the first priority for Holly.
This is the most important part of his long-term future, which will ensure him for ten consecutive years.
Everyone was surprised to hear his decision to leave.
Not everyone believed when they heard what happened on Tuesday, because the date it was about to open is imminent.
There's a store full of goods available for sale in the Marlow's central office."
According to experts, the resignation of the host of The Morning, who is one of Britain's most lucrative stars, could cause millions of loss to the company because of the large amount of money deposited on products such as pillows, clothing, and furniture, and due to the risk of delaying the start date.
Their long-standing friendship can also end there.
Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close friends with Willoughby, already having three children, and his wife, Dan Baldwin.
Capp and Willoughby co-founded Truly in 2016, and it was March that Jones, 52, became the director.
Both go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the money in the IT industry of Baldwin.
Willoughby is once again finding the role of M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McParlin with the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
One source close to Jones said last night, "We can't talk about his business."
Strong words 'and then we love each other'
He poked fun at the criticisms of journalists for making comments that people might think they are "not worthy of the presidency" and that he had hopes about North Korea's president.
Why was President Trump so tolerant?
Mr. Trump responded and copied the voice of the "information producer".
"I never gave it up."
Kim says she wanted to hold a second meeting, when Mr. Trump said their first meeting in Singapore in June was an important step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
The negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons are still pending.
More than three months after the Singapore summit last June, Ri Yong Ho announced the highest North Korean diplomat in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not yet seen the United States "appropriating" in its first steps to eliminate arms.
Instead, the US continues its sanctions aimed at forcing us more strongly.
Trump's speech in the campaign speech was more optimistic than that.
“We have a very good deal with North Korea,” he says.
"We've been inclined to read war against North Korea.
Nearly millions have lost their lives.
But now we have a good relationship with them."
Their efforts to improve the relationship with Kim – the frecas have been stopped, the hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers are returned home.
And he strongly defended his unusual perspective when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like the President, but let’s see 200 people standing here, rather than seeing 10,000 people out of this crowded stadium,” Trump said, pointing to people who gathered in front of him.
One island in Indonesia was destroyed by tsunamis and earthquakes, hundreds killed
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations from abroad received a message that their assistance was unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the residents of Lombok have been affected, no natural statement has been issued, but this is what is needed to provide international aid.
“It’s often unfortunate that they said they don’t ask for international aid, so we’re too busy,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, it remains unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work at home.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are still looking into the situation in Palu to be seen if they are allowed to help in providing assistance to international offices.
Considering Indonesia’s regular earthquake, the country’s unwillingness to deal with the indignation of nature can always be disastrous.
Of course, there are shelters in Aceh where there is a tsunami, but villages along the other coast do not.
The apparent lack of alarm alert in Palu may have contributed to the death toll, even though warnings have been issued.
Even when there is no problem, travel between many islands that make up Indonesia is difficult.
The nature of natural disasters makes the issue more difficult.
A hospital ship was docked in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake from Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the damaged infrastructure in Indonesia during his election campaign, and spent millions of dollars on roads and railway routes.
A lot for Mr Joko's regime but lack of financial resources, especially next year's elections.
The tension between different religions in Indonesia is also a problem ahead of Mr Joko, as there are many Muslim believers who live their faith in the form of more traditionalism.
More than 1,000 people have been killed or displaced as a result of Christian and Muslim encounters on the streets, using knives, and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge has died of a long distance kick similar to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from being defeated by Chelsea on Saturday by the Premier League for a bullet he scored at the89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an offer from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was 27 meters away from Chelsea’s goal, which led 1-0.
He took the ball home to his family first, which he hit hard for the most distant goal.
The ball went up high, reaching the right corner of the net.
Then the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped high and caught in the net.
"I was just trying to go to that place, that I got the ball, because players like Shaq always played balls as early as possible, which is why I tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante get closer and hit the ball once, then I didn't really care but I kicked it right away."
Chelsea led 1-0 on vacation as Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal at 25th minute.
At that time, the Blues attacker handed back the ball that Mateo Kovacic offered, and then suddenly turned around the middle of the stadium and huddled hard towards the Guardian of Liverpool.
Kovacic scored a goal in the middle of the stadium and fled quickly.
He then kicked the ball through several players and led Hazard to the stake.
The top spot on the one side failed to win Hazard's running so he arrived at the top of the longest tree, so he kicked the ball from the left to the goal of Alsson Becker, Liverpool's goalkeeper.
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011. On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool will face Napoli in a joint battle within the Champions League, in San Paolo Square in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in London on Thursday at 3pm, in the UEFA Europa League.
Indonesia’s tsunami has raised the death toll of 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has raised the death toll of 832, according to the National Disasters Bureau on Sunday morning.
Several people are reported to have been trapped under the rubble of the 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which caused a wave of sea waves reaching up to 6 meters, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson at a press conference.
The town of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is covered with rocks and trees from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect who killed a woman on a stake
A criminal investigation was opened after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was full of dead bodies when she was found at 7am and 55 minutes old at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for allegedly killing her.
The police asked residents around who could or heard anything to approach them.
Detetive Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is still starting, but I am inviting people around who might see or hear suspicious things coming to us.
I'm also calling for people, especially taxi drivers, to receive photos from their cars that would help in our investigation.'
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman was found dead and found inside the house.
That afternoon, a friend who was believed to have known her master on the ground asked where her body was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are now passing the news to the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was about to go home but the police prevented him from entering or leaving the house.
He was shocked when he learned what happened next.
Residents are now informed that it may take hours to get back to their homes.
Someone heard that the police told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime site.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He kept repeating 'it was terrible'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police trucks in the area that were not accessible, and another truck was waiting outside.
Several police officers stood inside the restricted area, monitoring the entire building.
Anyone who has access to the news is asked to send a live message to @MerPoliceCC, calling for 101 or sending anonymous information to Crimestoppers by number 0800,555 111 to announce the September 30th issue of the year.
Cromwell's monument to parliament is the latest heritage of the series 'The story has been rewritten'
The elimination seems to have come back in the form of poetry, in response to the fact that it destroyed the Taliban's way of destroying cultural and religious heritage in the UK by its blizzards claiming to be radical religious.
The Cromwell Foundation says the proposal by Mr Crick is "a way" and "try to rewrite history."
Mr. John Goldsmith, editor of the Cromwell Foundation, said: "In this debate on the removal of monuments, there is no doubt that Oliver Cromwell's photo in front of Westminster Palace will also be discussed.
Cromwell, however, did not order or fulfill the damage that took place during the Civil War in England.
Cromwell won't be sacrificed for what Mr. Thomas the Great did in the past century.
The beauty of Cromwell's face by Sir William Hammon Thorneycroft is remarkable and is a solid evidence of the 19th century's stereotypes and part of the image that captures the story of an important figure that many now consider worthy to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people are now, and perhaps even more than they were at the end of the 19th century, consider Cromwell to be a champion of parliament from outside pressure, in his day it is evident that the king and the court did so.
However, the question of whether this monument really represents its image remains a historical issue today.
What is certain is that the conflict that took place in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our country in the future, and Cromwell is a form that everybody knows to represent one side of this conflict.
His work as lard Protector is also worthy to be celebrated and remembered."
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig bite
A farmer was killed after he was hit by a pig bite in a market in southwestern China, according to local journalists.
The man, known as "Yuan," was found dead near the pig's house, and was found to have suffered a massive stroke, he was heavily covered in Liupanshui's market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing for a pork vaccine at the pork market on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It was Wednesday that he and his brother came from Yunnan province on the other side of the market to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found his body, and he noticed that the door of a nearby pig home was opened.
There he found a big pig covered with blood on his mouth.
When the doctors investigated, they confirmed that the man carrying 250 kilograms of pork had touched the farmer and killed him, reports.
"My brother's legs were bloody and broken," his brother, dubbed "Wu," as he told Guiyang Evening News.
The video footage caught by the CCTV shows Yuan entering the market to feed her pigs at 4:40am.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yan or his brother.
The shop manager told Envening News that the pig had been shut down for once to bite another person, until police removed the evidence there.
Yuan's family and market officials seem to negotiate damages for his death.
In the past, there have been cases where pigs have been bitten.
In 2016, there was a couple in Massachusetts who were bitten by pigs, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a huge pig weighing 295 kilograms from his tractor had forced a Welsh farmer until his wife expelled the animal.
On another occasion, a farmer in Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, and a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs should never be harsh enough to be "survival" if he smells of blood.
“She only thinks about playing.
They are pests, they like to kick... and not deliberately to hurt someone.
You just have to be careful in front of him,” he says.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains on the southwestern part of the United States.
According to meteorologists, the effects of Hurricane Rosa were reduced when they received cooler waters on the south coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring plenty of rain to the northern part of Mexico and the south of the United States in recent days.
Rosa's wind reached 135km per hour, allegedly a Category 1 on Sunday morning at 5pm East, and 620 km west of Punta Eugniya, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
On the other hand, there is a dépression formed in the Pacific Ocean, and as Rosa approaches the head of Baja Californie on Monday as a tropical storm, the heavy moisture will begin to turn back to the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 sm in many parts of Mexico on Monday.
When this happens, due to the contact of tropical moisture with the dépression, there will be a huge amount of rainfall that will develop in the southwestern part of the day.
If a region receives 2.5 sm to 10 sm, dangerous water will arrive, mud and landslides.
Due to heavy rainfall there will be around 5 mm rainfall per hour in some areas, especially in some areas of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that the rains will pour from 5 sm to 10 sm in some parts of the south to the west, especially across Arizona.
There could also be a flood of water due to the sudden deteriorating weather as tropical rain has spread widely.
It should then be purchased to walk all the time in the world due to the possibility of rain.
As a result of the heavy rains, the canyon may turn into a mighty river and there will also be strong winds and dust of the storm.
The controversial dépression will also bring heavy rains to some parts of the southern coast of Californie.
There would be rainfall to reach 1.5 sm, which could lead to mudslides full of garbage and street clearing.
This is the first rainfall in this region for the summer.
On Sunday evenings and Monday morning, tropical rain will begin to roll around Arizona, before the rain will grow more on Monday evenings and Tuesdays.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, heavy rains will spread across Four Corners.
In October, temperatures across the United States may vary considerably as Arctics will cool off, but the tropics are still warm.
Sometimes it can make a lot of difference in the temperature of a neighborhood.
On Sunday, there was a significant example of this change in temperature across the central part of the United States.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, was for example.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to unite and expand.
Hopefully the beginning of October will be hot for most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, where temperatures in the South Plains will reach 80 degrés to the northeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degré on Tuesday, which is about 10 degré above the average.
The long-term weather forecast suggests that the average average temperature for the eastern United States during the first half of October is almost certain.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh interrogation.
More than 20 million people watched the dramatic testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, expected to be appointed member of the Supreme Court, and woman Christine Blasey Ford, accusing him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s on six TV stations.
On the other hand, political correctance continues, and TV shuts down its show to report on the most unexpected incident: a contract designed by Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
In front of the Senate's Council of Law, Ford said she was sure 100 percent of the day that Kavanaugh was drunk and reprimanded her genitalia and tried to strip off her clothes at a high-school party.
Instead, Mr. Kavanaugh responded, during a rare testimony, but he was sure that it was 100 percent without it.
It seems likely that the more than 20.4 million people reported by the Nielsen on Friday followed suit.
The company is considering the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of other live TV channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, is still unknown.
Nielsen is also usually too busy to measure the number of viewers at work.
For a simple comparison, it is similar with viewers in football américain or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel was at the top of all TV channels, with investigators actively supporting Mr. Kanavanaugh's appointment, as it reached 5.69 million views during the entire day-long interrogation, reported Nielsen.
ABC, however, had 3.26 million views.
CBS also had 3.1 million views, NBC won 2,94 million, MSNBC saw 2,89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, as reported.
The public was still very interested after the interrogation.
Mr. Flake was the focus of everyone during Friday's events.
When Republican Senator modéré's office announced that he would support Mr. Kavanaugh in the vote, the protesters captured him and CBS files when he tried to join a firecenseur for a hearing by the Law Commission.
He stood up but bowed his eyes while people shouted him several minutes, as it appeared on CNN's TV.
"I am standing before you now," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the truth to the country?
Someone told her, "You have power, but many women don't see separation."
Mr. Flake said there is already a statement published by my office, and he added prior to the closing of an ascenseur that he will say something more during the council hearing.
All cable TV channels and satellites broadcast live the following month, when the Legislative Council voted on the transmission of Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination for the whole Senate.
But Mr. Flake has announced that he will not do so unless the FBI is allowed to investigate the accused for a week, as the Democratic minority has requested.
Among those who persuaded Mr. Flake was an interview he had with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, Democrats.
Mr. Flake decided after interviewing Mr. Coons and a few senators afterwards.
Mr. Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that the number of Republicans would not be enough to accept Mr. Kavanaugh's appointment without the investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation into charges against Mr. Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accused his critics of playing 'political games' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to quit the European Union, saying that she "played politics" on the future of Britain and ignored the country's welfare at a Sunday Times press conference.
British Prime Minister Theresa May 29, 2018, arrived to attend the Conservanteur Party's Summit in Birmingham, Britain.
In a press conference near the one where the prime minister was on the front page, Boris Johnson, former foreign minister, confirmed his accusations against the so-called Chequers for Brexit, saying that the proposal that both Britain and the European Union should take any taxes upon him is "a ridiculous way."
Wayde Sims shooting: Dyonn Simpson was arrested by police, suspected of being involved in the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims's attack on LSU.
Dyonn Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and sentenced to prison for an intentional murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Service.
The authorities have publicly released the album of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and the police claimed Sims' glasses had been lost during the war.
The eyeglasses were picked up by police from the scene of the crime, and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB report, working for CBS.
When Simpson was interrogated, police said he confessed to shooting and killed Wayde.
The cost of his interim release was determined to be 350,000, according to one lawyer.
The General Council of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, leading to the death of a head shot from the neck.
The agency thanked the anti-crime team for escaping from the state police in Louisiana, the crime camp of the state police, the Southern University police and the citizens in the area for aiding the investigation to make this arrest possible.
Joe Alleva, the head of an athlete at LSU, thanked the regional security forces for "persisting and remaining honest."
Sims is 20 years old who died.
The 1m82 front grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, played a LSU basketball in the same city.
During the previous year, she joined 5,6 and managed to catch 2.6 goal per game in general.
On Friday morning, Mr. Will Wade, a basketball coach at LSU, said the team was "completely discouraged" and "great enough" to hear of Wayde's death.
“That’s where people worry at all times,” said Mr. Wade.
Volcanoes in Mexico City release ash · Global Voices
Heavy ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern capital city of Mexico.
The National Institute for Disaster prevention warned the Mexican people on Saturday to avoid the volcano because something was seen happening in their mouth and the number of gas and ash emissions recorded in 24 hours was 183.
There are also a number of noises and vibrations followed by the centre.
Photos of thin ashes covered the windows of cars in several cities around Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, flooded social networks.
Geologists and tourism have found that the volcanic scene has increased from 72 kilometers south of the capital to the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that reached the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been revived since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clashed as the vote nears the memory of independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday when pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and thousands joined in the rally to mark Catalogne's first anniversary of voting for secession.
A number of people have sided with riot police, but threw eggs and paint powder, so the streets that should be filled with tourists are covered with black dust at this time.
A kiss also occurred in the evening and the police used batons to separate the fighters.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No one is missing, there is no forgiveness" were confronted by supporters of the country chanting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries on protesters, according to local journalists.
The line between the pro-independence regions is still two-fold, one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid said was illegal, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Almost all voters voted for independence, but few came to the polls because opponents of secession were not willing to take part in the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in the past year when police tried to block votes at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
On Friday night, a group of independent independent people held a watch to stop those who planned to protest in support of the national police.
There was a slow down but was forced to use another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electric generator who attended the separatist movement with his wife, says he no longer believes that Catalogne will ever be independent.
"This past year we have had one of the best things.
I remember my parents bursting into tears of joy because we could only cast votes, but now we have no way to go,” she says.
Although Catalan independence advocates managed to win a victory, which took place in spite of the small margins during the regional elections last December, the party was busy holding its winning courage because many of its leaders became involved in land or prison waiting for their responsibility for the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old carmaker, who has captured the demonstration in support of police on his mobile phone, says politicians from both sides have been fueling this conflict.
"The rope is getting tense," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed since last year, announced that he will run for parliamentary elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European election is the best way to reveal the poor democratic values and oppression we see in Spain," he says.
London: A car collapsed in the house, several men arrested · Global Voices
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit a house in London several times.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30pm BST.
The building’s gates and walls were particularly damaged, according to Det Insp Bob Blemmings.
It could also have been shot in the line towards the house that evening.
Livingston won Rangers with a 1-0 victory by Menga
The winner was Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston.
Livingston suddenly defeated Rangers, only 2 defeats Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as head of the Ibrox team.
This Dolly Menga champion changed something, as Gary Holt's team rose to the equivalent of Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team in the Presiership team has yet to win a victory in the country this season and they will face the Hearts, who are at the forefront and have eight points of interest on Sunday.
Before that, however, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, within the Europa League.
Livingston, on the other hand, is still unbeatable in the game's recent game, as the Holt coach has won a victory ever since she faced Kenny Miler a month ago.
Could not save Livingston in front of the hard-hit foreign
Holt's team continued to expand before his death, as the integrity of their attacks has always caused various problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson was finally hit but the ball didn't turn right when he hit the head, then Alan Lithgow couldn't do anything except go out when he was trying to turn the ball by Craig Halket on his head.
The landlord did not mind leaving Rangers playing with them, because he knew he could have bothered the guests by a high-level kick.
And that seems to have been the result of the number that changed the hierarchy.
The Rangers made a mistake leading a coup-franc and Livingston sought a breeding route, united Declan Gallagher and Robinson to give Menger the way to the tournament, which won so much that he kicked from the center of the box.
The Rangers, however, have always occupied the stadium, but they have never been able to read the householder’s goal, so there has been little danger to the goalkeeper Liam Kelly,
It seems that this was the case during the second half, though a kick from Alfredo Morelos was quickly arrested by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was also about to lose a goal but it was kicked off by the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and then Lithgow's champion was so paralysed when he got a good job from Livingston player.
The race to Livingston's goal was not cut off but was still blocked, and there were also two rings – one was Halkett's fault with the substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other as a result of a hand-to-hand kick – but was beaten out.
Livingston's performance was "unprecedented" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, by BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's performance was unprecedented.
Each one of them did nothing, and kept doing more than what they thought they could do now.
There has been little change in how they play and make up the team since they returned to the summit, but Holt is especially praised for his ability to unite the team since coming home.
There were also many heroes in his team.
Halkett's record was huge, leading the highly organized defense, but Menga never allowed Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall freedom during the match.
However, the Rangers seem to have found little to lose.
Their game is sometimes good under Gerrard, but they have failed to reach that standard here.
Their attacks have not always come true – they've met once from the other side of the park – so they should be a wake-up call for Rangers, because they're now out of balance.
Erdogan's reception in Spain is quite mixed.
Saturday (September 29) was seen with a smile and a blue sky during the morning breakfast of the presidents of Turquie and allemagne in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's critical visit to Allemagne – to restore relations between NATO allies.
Human rights, press freedom, and Turquie's involvement in the European Union are part of their differences.
Later President Erdogan came to Spain to dedicate a new major mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turque indigenous population outside Turuie.
For security reasons, 25,000 people were prevented by the police from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters still came to see the president.
Erdogan's opposition was also politically motivated – and the majority Kurdes – expressing their views, condemning Erdogan's policies and Allemagne's refusal to accept him as a foreigner.
The opposite protest reflected a photo of a foreigner causing division, dubbed by some German nationals as a savior, but has been accused by others as a dictator.
Deptford traffic accident: A cyclist hit by a car dies
A cyclist hit by a car in London died.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street branch and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10am and 15 BST.
The driver stopped, and a doctor came to care for it, but the man died without running water.
The incident was months after a fatal cyclist escaped from Childers Street, about a mile and a half away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police reported that they were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
The roads were blocked so buses had to turn around and drivers were ordered to choose another route immediately to pass.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured during kiss
Six prison guards were injured during a robbery in a safety prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The unrest at HMP Long Lartin in Worcester began at 9:30am on Sunday morning, and is not over yet.
Special trained police officers called "Tornado" were invited there to settle the riots, which left eight prisoners in one section of the prison.
The prison guards were treated at the site for a light wound on their faces.
The prison department stated: "There are specialized prison guards who have been trained to solve problems in HMP Long Lartin.
Six prison guards received medical treatment for his injuries.
We don’t tolerate the violence inside the prison, and it’s clear that the perpetrators will have to be delivered to the police and could add more time to their imprisonment.”
There are more than 500 inmates at HMP Long Lartin, including the country's most feared prisoners.
According to a June report, the prison chief was forced to hospital after being injured by a prisoner.
And in October some of the prison guards were forced to call for riot police because some of them were hit with billard balls.
Typhoon Rosa is threatening to generate water in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (it would be beneficial for drought-hit areas)
It's rare that dépression tropicale has arrived in Arizona, but that's exactly what might happen earlier this week, as the remaining clouds of Hurricane Rosa are going to read the Desert Southwest, and are threatening to create a flood.
The National Bureau of Meteorology has already issued a water alert for Monday and Tuesday from west Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to adjust to Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain right until Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Meteologist tweeted that "the tropical storm that has affected the tropicale or medépression in 260 kilometers around Phoenix is ten" since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was the only typhoon to reach 60 kilometers near the AZ province."
According to the latest estimates published by the National Hurricane Institute, rainfall can reach 5 mm to 10 sm, and it can reach 15 sm at Molallon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of Desert Southwest, such as Central Rockies and Great Basin, may have 2.5 sm to 5 sm, but some places may have up to 10 sm.
For those who are not threatened with water, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because it is a drought-hit area.
Of course, there is a serious problem with flooding, but it would be good to have the rainfall come because the South-west is now dry.
According to the U.S. Geological Monitoring Office, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s population is suffering from severe drought, the second most severe category, reports theweather.com.
For one thing, Hurricane Rosa is expected to land in the Far California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is located about 620 km south of Punta Eugnia, Mexico, which leads to 20 km of speed per hour.
The power of the storm is decreasing as it encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean.
So it is believed that he would become a troll when he made landfall in Mexico in the afternoon or later on Monday afternoon.
Mexico's heavy rainfall could be severe, resulting in severe flooding.
"A 75 sm to 15s of rain is believed to have been obtained by Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, and it can even reach 25 sm in some places," says Gweather.com.
Then Rosa, who is now tempête tropicale, will cross the north of Mexico before arriving at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning in the form of an tropicale dépression, will go up to Arizona and arrive south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and Desert Southwest in the United States is the most significant danger Rosa is supposed to bring or the remaining clouds," says the National Institute of Hurricanes.
As a result of this rain, there are fears that mudslides with wood and stone can die and flow in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Arrest of four people who attempted to kill
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for planning to kill, when a 16-year-old boy was found full of eggs in Somerset.
The seriously injured boy was found in Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4am BST on Saturday.
He was immediately taken to the hospital and was reported to be "safe".
A 17-year-old boy, aged 18, and a 20-year-old man, was arrested that night in Radstock neighborhood, according to the High Police and Somerset.
The police asked any person who could get a photo album of what happened on their mobile phone to approach them.
Mr. Trump says Kavanaugh is 'enraged by the harshness and anger of the Democratic Party's party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Party's unwilling and shameful tactics," said Mr. Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump stated that during the plan for the appointment of the sonugh, the latter was a "dignified by the harshness and anger of the Democratic Party".
Mr. Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and firmly rejected Christine Blasey Ford's charges of sexual misconduct against him decades ago, as long as they were both children.
Ford also came to testify about his accusations during the session.
The President said on Saturday that the American people "found the intelligence, intelligence and courage of Kavanaugh" that day.
"The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the appointment of one of the best lawyers of our time, the people have always been a good judge in their service," he told a group of supporters who attended him in West Virginia.
The president took the opportunity to talk about the importance of the Republican election arrival.
"It's just a week and one of the most important elections in our lives will come.
I am not running for elections, but in fact I am running for office,” he says.
"That's why I travel abroad to fight for the best candidates."
Mr. Trump announced that the Democrats are marching "against and blocking."
The first important vote in the Senate in the lead-up to the appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh should take place on Friday at the end of the day, the top GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the earthquake, a tsunami in Indonesia, an increasing number of casualties.
The death toll was not less than 384, many of which were hailed by massive waves on the coast, following a massive earthquake and tsunami that took place on the Sulawesi island in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a party on the beach in Palu last Friday, covering six meters across the beach in the morning, swallowing many people and destroying everything they went through.
Before the tsunami, an earthquake hit 7.5.
"When the tsunami alert was made yesterday, people continued to do what they did on the beach instead of fleeing, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB, Indonesia’s disaster office, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by alone, but had been torn by cars, trunks, houses, they beat everything that happened to them on dry land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had reached 800 km per hour before reaching the beach.
Someone climbed a tree from the tsunami and that didn't kill him, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial photographs uploaded by the disaster office show that many houses and shops have been destroyed, distorted, broken bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Last Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by the waves left in the earthquake.
There were 2.4 million people living in the region who felt these series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Technology (BPPT) says the energy generated by the massive earthquake last Friday was about 200 times as strong as the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, located on the steps of a narrow bay, may have increased the intensity of the tsunami, they say.
Nugroho said that the devastation was "exploded" and that thousands, he says, houses, hospitals, markets and collapsed hotels.
According to him, 540 were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho says more victims and damages could be found on the coast, in an area called Donggala, 300 km north of Palu, as it is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The connection is complete because no news has reached" from Donggala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in the statement, and its staff and volunteers have already gone to the devastated areas.
“This is so cruel, but the situation can get worse than this,” he says.
The agency received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said that shortly after warning, the waves had arrived.
A citizen video footage circulated on social media of a man on the floor shouting loudly that people on the street would hear a tsunami coming.
Minutes later, high waves swept the coast, leaving home and car.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the authenticity of the album.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, electricity was cut off around the city so no one was able to communicate around Palu, so authorities found it difficult to coordinate emergency efforts.
Authorities say the army had already started sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, but many of the displaced people still need emergency food and supplies.
The city's airport was finally opened for safety, and will continue until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widododo was reportedly to visit the camps that took place in Palu.
Indonesia’s tsunami has raised the death toll of more than 800 people.
This is very dangerous.
It is true that World Vision staff from Donggal have returned to Palu, where refugees live in tents at the edge of their workplace, but they have seen much damage along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
“They found so many houses destroyed,” he says.
This is very dangerous.
Many relief groups are now beginning to work hard after natural disasters, but some complain that foreign skilled aid workers are banned from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesia's law, there must be national statements that a disaster zone has been affected by natural disasters in order to provide funding, configurations and workers from abroad.
But no such statement has ever been made.
"The disaster has affected the region yet," said Aalia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the state says "Yes, the entire country is affected by this disaster," it can be opened for international aid, but we are not yet."
This is the second night in Palu since the earthquake and tsunami hit Friday, and friends and family of the missing people still hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle of bringing a bit of happiness in this disaster.
Saturday a little boy was hit alive from a sewage pump.
On Sunday, ambulances took a woman into a rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national parapente Indonesian national team, trained two missing parapentes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others in Two Hotels were also followers of Mr. Mandaghi.
"My heart is heavy, as I am an old man in the parapente sector," he says.
Gendon reports that a few hours after the news spread among the parapenteists that Two Hotels were destroyed, the candidates from Palu, who participated in a rally on the beach, posted several messages via WhatsApp.
His message was only one gray sign, not two blue symbols.
“I think they didn’t even receive the message I sent,” he says.
$ 26.750 went to thieves during GAB filling in Newport on Levee
On Friday morning, 26750 $26,750 were seized by Brink's staff feeding GAB in Newport on Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Office.
The driver posted the GAB inside a park and prepared to add extra money, according to Det. Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "rund up after the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money he was about to send.
According to the statement, several people were found fleeing the area, but the police did not specifically mention the number of people who were protected by this robbery.
It is encouraged to call the Newport police in number 859-92-3680 who have information about these people.
Kanye West: Rap singer makes a name for Ye · Global Voices
Rap singer Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter last Saturday referring to the change in his name: "The officially known as Kanye West."
At one point, 41-year-old West was named Ye and it was the title of his eighth album, which was published last June.
This change is just before he goes through Saturday Night Live, where he is supposed to release his new album, Yandhi.
He is the foreign successor to the show's Arian Grande singer, who suddenly quit because of "a emotional motive," the creator of the show said.
West states that the term is both a short time for its current professional name and a religious sense of identity.
"I think 'ye' is the most active word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier in the year, referring to the title of his album to the radio show Big Boy.
“And I am you, and we are, and we are.
So it came from Kanye, which means it's alone, and it's coming to Ye – there's nothing but the good, the bad, the confused, everyone in us.
This album reflects more on us."
He was one of several popular rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he once again announced he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
His Western colleague JAY-Z was also there, who admitted that his name was always valid if it was a price tag, whether it was written or vowel.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use military forces to fight civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to use military forces to fight civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on student protests has taken place.
On Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza, Mr Lopez Obrador promised that "he would send the military to kill the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters in the square, killing less than 300 people, during a student leftist movement across Amérique Latine.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by providing monthly allowances for those who study and opening a new public university.
Being unemployed and unable to study, he says, is why young people are drawn to criminal organizations.
The US should double its funding for I.A.
China is growing in the field of artificial intelligence (IA), so the United States should double its cost for research on the platform, says IA investor and investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This was his remark when various US government departments made a statement about IA, even though the United States has no official strategy for the IA.
Sina, on the other hand, has been promoting its plans for the past year: it aims to be at the top of IA reform since 2030.
“It’s good to start double the IA research budget, because the United States is already lagging behind in every other country, and we’re waiting for the most important news for IA,” Lee said.
As the currency doubles, chances can be double that the next biggest reform in the IA world will happen, Lee said in a CNBC press conference this week.
Lee, who wrote the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" released this month by Houghton Mofflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who created one of the top companies in China, Face history.
In the 80s, he worked in Carnegie Mellon University for an IA system that defeated the best American Othello player, and after that he was a senior worker in Microsoft Research and was head of Google's service in China.
Lee acknowledged that the technology competition organized by the US government was good, such as the Robotics Challenge at the Defense Adventure Research Projects Agency and wondered when the next edition would take place, in order to identify the intellectual leaders of the future.
Researchers in the United States who receive state funding often need to work hard.
“It’s not China that draws the academic leaders out, it’s the company,” Lee added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech-focused companies have inspired various university stars to focus on IA.
A change in immigration policy may also help the United States speed up its efforts for IA, Lee says.
“I think those who have a doctorat in the IA should immediately be given a verte card,” he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a new version of IIA development.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China provides funding to people at the educational institutes, similar to that provided by the National Science Foundation and other state institutions for American researchers, but the quality of academic activity in China is lower, Lee says.
At the beginning of the year in the United States, the Ministry of Defense established a joint center for the artificial intelligentsia, which is designed to unite industry and education partners, and the White House announced that the Commission currently formed the selection of the artificial intelligentsia.
The DARPA also announced this month that it would cost AI Next $2 billion to the event.
For NSF, the IA research fund is now worth more than $100 million.
On the other hand, there has not been any legal action in the United States intended to implement the National Intelligence Commission.
Voters in Macedonia cast their votes in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters in Macedonia will vote in a referendum to question whether or not the country's name will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a measure that will ease their decades-old conflict with Greece, which has prevented his intention to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has been increasingly hesitant about the fact that the name of this neighbouring country in the north is threatening its land, and has continued to interfere with NATO and the European Union.
The two governments agreed on the new name to be changed in June, but some opposition nationalists said that if the name was changed, Macedonia's majority Slovaks would be an act of respect.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote during the referendum and that the number of voters to vote is expected to ignore the 50 percent required to validate the referendum.
The question raised in the referendum is: "Do you accept joining NATO and the European Union through accepting the Greece agreement?"
Supporters of the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it would be better to accept as part of a group like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born as a result of Yugoslavie's fall.
"I came today to cast votes for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that I can live with freedom under the European Union because it means a better life for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally defined but must be followed, the number of parliamentarians said they would follow the results of the vote in order to make it change immediately.
Two thirds of parliament members are required to accept the change.
The National Electoral Commission said that until 1 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
However, not more than 16 percent of the voters voted, while 34 percent voted in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of the registered voters turning to the polls.
"I voted for my children, because we should be in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
In Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko, went to the polls to change the country's name so that the door would open to NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and placed a seat in front of the tent set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to honor it rather than insist on the trajectory," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we're still proud.
If they don't want our name Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia again and join the Union for European and Asia."
NATO integration will bring urgent investments to Macedonia, said Prime Minister Zaev, as unemployment rates are already more than 20 percent.
“I think that the majority of the population will be encouraged because more than 80 percent of citizens appreciate entering the European Union and NATO,” said Mr. Zaev after voting.
The victory of the "yes" he says will be "a solid foundation for our future."
According to a standard survey published by Macedonia's Institute of Political Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will come to vote in the referendum – that is, less than the required number.
Another simple survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote "yes".
About 50 percent of the electorate and one voter need to come to the polls, where the referendum was almost successful.
If this referendum were to fail, it would be the first major defeat for Western-led policies since it ruled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguiro of Manchester City walked through all Brighton's goals and scored a goal
Sergio Aguiro and Raheem Sterling summarized Brighton’s goal as he won 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguiro's opening goal at 65 minutes looks very easy.
Argentina's attackers first got services from the central square.
He walked between the three previous Brighton's goals, then leaked to the public.
Suddenly, four greeners surrounded Aguiro.
He quickly turned behind a front row, then passed the long queues in the corner of Brighton’s goal.
Then he kicked the ball from the left, and Sterling got it.
When the British attackers kicked off the first goal inside the goal at the stake, they returned it to Aguiero, who kicked it on the right and dragged Msew Ryan, Brighton's goalkeeper, because the ball was located on the right corner with a net.
"A small problem disturbs the right foot of Agero," Pep Guardiola, the City director, told the press.
“We said that he only played 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were very lucky that he had scored a goal at that time."
Sterling but the main advantage of Sky Blues in this game for the Premeer League was Sky Blues.
He scored that goal in the 29th minute.
Aguiro was receiving services in Brighton territory.
It's pretty nice to kick that ball across the left side of the park for Leroy Sane.
Sane kicks the ball forward before leading Sterling to a narrow stake.
The ball was nearly out of the park when Sky Blues' host kicked it into the net.
On Tuesday at 12 p.m. and 55pm City will meet with the Homenheim in the group for the Champions League, at Rhein-Neckar-Are in Sinsheim, Allemagne.
Scherzer wants to play at the Rockies meeting
There was no longer any reason to force for the first time, as the Nationals were no longer on the final stage.
Scherzer, however, is so competitive that he will be able to throw the Sunday ball at the Colorado Rockies meeting, the only measure is that the Rockies will have an impact on the finals of the game, as they benefit from a game at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies won the position of joker when the Nationals won 5-2 on Friday night, but so far it is still hopeful to win the first round of the election.
“Even if there is nothing we can fight against, at least we will be encouraged because we know that the air in Denver will be heaty with viewers and other teams I am sure to publish the best in it, more than I have seen this year.
How can I not be so quick to compete with that?"
The Nationals have so far not yet made it known who will play for the first time on Sunday, but it seems that Scherzer would be the one to throw the ball if that is the case.
On Thursday, Scherzer, who will attend the 34th World Cup for its first time, took a football test, and he will also throw a ball on Sunday even though it is his holiday day.
The right-wing player in Washington has 18-7 points, and for this season he has 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3.
President Trump gathers people in West Virginia · Global Voices
The President made a brief discussion about the situation surrounding Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, whom he chose to appoint in the Supreme Court, in a reference to the importance of the Republican election arrival.
"In November we have all achieved a balance.
One of the most important elections in our lives will be five weeks away.
This is one of the largest, most important - I don't run for elections but in fact I am running for elections, which makes me travel to a region that fights for these good candidates," she says.
President Trump has always said, "You see these extreme Democratic groups, those who are doing what they do now.
And they are ready to take power again in every way, ye see the cruelness of their wickedness.
They don't talk about who they are affected, who they have to pay for power and discipline, which is what they need, power and discipline, but we won't give them."
Democrats have taken a mission “to protest and stop,” he says.
“And you see what has been in the last four days,” he says, saying the Democrats are “anger and aggressive and bad and don’t speak the truth.”
He specifically mentioned Democrat Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Legal Council, which was celebrated by the attendees.
"Do you remember his response?
Have you published any documents?
No, no, what?
No, mm, no, one I expect – this act is really wrong – this is the worst act I've ever seen."
Laour party is no longer a free church.
He does not tolerate anyone who dares to express himself
Not surprisingly, Momentum activists in our city voted to silence me.
In fact, I was the last MP of Labour to say that my opinion was unnecessary – the reason was simple: I dared to comment.
The same was true of Joan Ryan, my parliamentary partner, because he was never shaken against anti-Semitism.
For me, the vote that criticized me was my opposition to Jeremy Corbyn's point of view.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, national security, on Europe, which makes it ironic that Jeremy was in conflict with the former leader.
The presentation letter for Nottingham East Labour's meeting on Friday said: "We welcome the meeting so that everyone can participate and see results."
For the past eight years, I have been a member of Labour's parliament, the GC's session was well-filled with these measures every Friday night.
Sadly, the atmosphere is not the same now in many meetings, and it has long been forgotten, if ever, that the "more kind and gentle" political promises were started.
The disagreement has become evident that the Laour party is not in favor of dissent and the public opinion that the party's leaders approve of or not is being judged first.
It all started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and there was a colleague who thought that I had been in the same political perspective as I had before started waiting for me to go back and accept a point of view that I cannot accept in the future – whether it is about national security or the common market in the EU.
Whenever I speak in public – whatever I say – the strong criticism on social networks calling for the removal of my name comes, criticizing the central party's policies, saying I shouldn't be part of the Laour party.
And I am not the only one to be affected.
I know it’s much easier to get me than some of my colleagues because I’ve noticed for political reasons.
I am impressed with the professional and persistence of colleagues who face harsh criticisms of men and women every day but never back down.
One of the most frustrating aspects of our political era is how strong words like what has become accepted by everyone.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the former liberal church, and the party becomes increasingly restrictive every time there is “a vote of trust” or a change in the rulings of the parliamentary elections.
In the past two years, many have advised me to walk slowly and safely, so that “no one is afraid of me.”
But that's not what I've been involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour party 32 years ago when I was a student, because I was frustrated with Thatcher’s administration which allowed the conventional schools to be destroyed in place, I have always fought to improve public affairs offered to those in need - whether I was a consultant in the city or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that I didn't understand my political views and what I didn't discuss with the authorities.
I have only one thing to say to those who urged the vote on Friday, when we see the country insisting on going to Brexit which will have a negative impact on homes, businesses and public affairs, I don't understand what it is like to lose time and dust to dig into whether I have turned my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the truth is that my message is not for Nottingham Momentum but for the people I love, whether I belong to or not: I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise no coup threat or political abuse to stop me from taking any measures that I believe best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is on top, which is never defeated
There were only two latest attempts to change the outcome, but it is no doubt that Ayr deserves the victory he won in the first Tentent match for the Premeership on that day, which was truly exciting.
They are now on top, because they are the only team that failed at least one in ten.
In fact, the team won the victory because of its hard security and ability to take advantage of the situation, and coach Peter Murchie is just enough to be happy.
"Our style of playing has always been shattered, but none of us has ever won, so I have to be happy," she says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, because they were more likely to abuse than our team."
A test by Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, confirmed by Frazier Climo, benefited Ayr, but Rory Hughes, captain of the Scotland, who was first released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the lack of numbers and was arrested by Jason Baggot.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr, and afterwards, just before the holiday, he scored a single goal and confirmed it to 17-5 the number of Ayr took off.
Melrose's second half began well and after Patrick Anderson, who was confirmed by Baggot, reduced to five more.
Then there was a long break due to Ruaridh Knottt's severe injuries, which had to be carried out of the park, and once the game returned, Ayr erupted again in an attempt by Stafford McDowall, confirmed Climo.
There, Blair Macgherson, an emergency captain for Ayr, got a yellow card, and Melrose again seized the advantage of his player and Bruce Colvine managed to test despite the fact that he did not want to confirm, after a brief battle.
The city's owners, however, recover, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for throwing Climo without a ball, from the mark of the pen, MacPerson takes the ball behind the line, from behind the Ayr's goal which is approaching.
Climo attacked the confirmation, as he did after the match back, when Kyle Rowe seized David Armstong's bow kick from the line and gave Gregory Henry a bid to kill the city's fifth team.
Still Game star appears to be ready to start a new job in the restaurant industry
Still Game player Ford Kieran appears to be ready to start a new job in the recruitment industry, when he is identified as the director of a company that has been allowed to have a restaurant.
He is 56 years old, and plays Jack Jarvis's role in the BBC's popular show, which he wrote and played with Greg Hemphill, a long-standing comedian.
The pair said that the ninth edition of the program will be the last, and Kiernan is already preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not answer questions about the news, but a news source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan intends to enter the “modern world of restaurants” in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolvie, who has no coastline, hopes that the court is again turning the way to the Pacific Ocean Water · Global Voices
La Paz's central naval office is a flotilla.
State office waving blue flags like the sea.
The naval base of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is covered with slogans: "The sea owners are ours.
It is our duty to take it back."
Remembering the death of Chile's coast during the bloody 19th-century war for resources is still a hot topic across Bolivia that has no coastline, and not less is the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean Water again.
This hope may not be as alive today in recent decades, as Bolvie is now awaiting a verdict on October 1 by an international court, after five years of deportation.
"Banivie has already taken a firm and calm stance, and is full of hope for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice (ICJ), hoping that the La Haye court will comply with Bolvie's request — after decades of serious negotiations – Chile will have to discuss how Bolvie will be given access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's hot president, is also looking forward to the next year's verdict — which is facing a fierce fight to re-election next year.
"The time is approaching for us to return to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will not be guaranteed to grant Bolvie justice - and that even if he is just, nothing will change.
The Dutch-based United Nations agency has no power to hand over parts of Chile's land to others, and has said it can't claim to be the owner of the final word on the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that only six months after the presentation of a conclusion the international court (ICJ) has ruled is under suspicion that the case is “not a problem,” said Paz Zárante, an expert from Chile on international law.
Four years ago, Bolvie's demands would not be met, but will only discourage her.
"The journey to the sea has now been confiscated by the Bolivian government," Zárante says.
Morales’ aggressive approach may have caused the little determination left in Chile to disappear, he said.
Bolivie and Chile will have to talk back to each other in the future, but it will be very difficult to discuss after this incident.
Both countries haven't been sending embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolvie in The Hague, denied that this time the court's verdict was too swift.
Monday will bring "a very good direction to open new relations with Chile" to Bolivia, he says, and it's an opportunity to "convenge the 139-year-old misunderstanding through a useful way to the one-sider and on the other."
Calzadilla also denied that Morales was using – one of Latin America's most beloved presidents – the sea issue will be a political ladder.
"Banivie won't give up her right to access to the Pacific River," she added.
"This is an order to go out we will see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will never be nuclear weapons destroyed if it cannot trust the United States
Mr Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said they would not destroy their first nuclear weapon if they couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Mr Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promise made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of these rival countries.
This was his remark if U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pom would soon open the nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the idea that pursuing the sanctions and opposing the United States will bring North Korea to its knees is "in the winter."
Washington is quick to accept the statement but Pyongyang does not take a significant step towards destroying weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
But many don't believe that Pyongyang is really ready to give up a lot of weapons that the country certainly takes in for the safety of its life.
Pom audio plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Mr. Kim and Trump.
The new product of the giant head-kidnapping has been found at a fashion exhibition in Paris which will soon reach your nearest high-level store.
Don't look further if you want to help the number of hats you collect or stop the sun from getting you.
Fashion designer Valentina and Thom Browne introduced a series of designs for the head, which are both ugly and huge enough to join the SS19 edition, on the stage where the Paris Fashion Week's fashion model shines.
The hard-to-use hats poured over Instagram this summer, and these fashion designers sent their sign-worded hats to display on the fashion stage.
Valentino's most striking hat, for example, is another bright - gray hat, with big lips like a bird's hair covered the head of the model completely.
It also included large ornaments full of precious stones, crowns of magicers, and even havings — but they are not intended to heat our heads.
There are also a number of bizarre masks Thom Browne showed - very timely for Halloween.
Most of these masks are silvery lips, and they don't seem to look like a high-quality fashion but a Hannibal Lecter.
There is an example of how they create a catacombs, including air pipes and eye safety, while the other looks like a edible snowhouse but melts.
And if you continue to show typical fashion, you have a chance.
Observers estimate these giant hats may come to the fashion store near you.
On the feet of 'La Bomba', Rihanna or Emily Ratajkowski had already put on the dried grass hat with their lips half a mile long.
Another important creative work was presented by this most well-known brand, who created the hard-to-use hats – bags brought to the beach, made of dried grass and needed to be the size of the model in swimsuits carrying it.
This old orange handbag, with a silhouette of palm beak covered with leather, was the most important invention in Jacquemus's products in the La Riviera SS19 series displayed during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a fashion designer, told FEMAIL: 'I hope the giant hats and purses on the beach next summer will come to high fashion vendors – the fashion designer's invention has had a huge impact so that it will be difficult to ignore the demand of a giant garland.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the world's population
Independent schools in Scotland are notorious for having a good harvest, and it continued in 2018 because the results were excellent, and the success of individuals and teams in sports, art, music and other collective activities increased.
There are more than 30,000 students across Scotland, so these schools, represented by the Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are working hard to provide their students and parents with the best educational services.
The private school aims to support its students in higher and deeper education, work to monitor and the place where they live of the world.
As the education sector allows each school to develop and implement educational programs, we now see that modern languages are still part of a highly developed and ambitious class in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you speak to someone in his language, your words come to his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, your words come into his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't only breathe in English if we want to create mutual trust and contact with people from other countries.
If we look at the final results of this year's test, it seems that foreign languages lead the best grades in private schools.
In total, 68 percent of foreign language students received less than 19/20.
This piece, which was obtained from 74 schools of SCIS members, found that 72 percent of students had 19/20 notes in Mandarin, compared with 72 percent of those studying Almand language, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish received 19/20 notes.
This shows that learning a foreign language is supported by private schools in Scotland because it is an ability for children and young people to make a living in the future.
Today, foreign languages, as a subject, share the same values as STEM (sians, technology, engineers and mathematics) courses in private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Work and Human Services found that in light of why the employers said they were too busy hiring the staff they needed, 17 percent were due to the lack of foreign speakers.
Thus, a foreign language can become an inevitable subject if it is to prepare young people for future assignments.
Such skills are essential in this globalized world, as the number of jobs requiring language skills continues to grow.
Whatever work a person chooses, if he has learned a foreign language, he will gain a lot from the future because he can use it for the rest of his life.
People who speak several languages will always benefit from their competitors because they can communicate directly with foreigners.
According to a simple interview conducted by YouGov with 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent are illiterate in order to have a simple conversation, and only French is the only foreign language spoken by 15 percent.
That's why it's important to raise money to improve learning of a foreign language, for the children who have broken down.
Children who speak several languages, especially the language of developing countries, will benefit from finding employment that is worth living.
Every school in Scotland will be separate from its language.
A number of schools will focus on teaching modern languages, but some will teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandrin or Japanese.
Whatever topics your children are interested in, there are a number of foreign languages that can always be consulted in private schools, and their teachers are special experts.
A private school in Scotland is ready to focus on creating a school environment for children to prepare and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It is undeniable today, in the global business world, that foreign languages are still vital to the future of the country, so they must be reflected in education.
It is true that foreign languages must be recognized as "the potential of international communication"
Private schools will continue to offer choices, differences and ideal practices to young people in Scotland.
Il faut biien le faire.

LeBron will play for the first time on Sunday at Lakers in San Diego
The waiting for fans who would like to see LeBron James play for the first time at Los Angeles Lakers is nearing.
Lakers' trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play on Sunday at the first season before the legal event, meeting with Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still not known how long he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers' personal journalist, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James' term might be limited.
The journalist asked James about what he was going to do in the six games that Lakers will be playing before the regular season, after the training took place earlier this week.
"I don't need a game to prepare for the regular season to be ready for this level of my career," he says.
Trump rally in West Virginia, Chaîne YouTube
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins several rallies this night.
This is the first gathering of five of President Trump's plans to take place this week, including a break in nearby cities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote has been confirmed to be suspended before the vote was confirmed to fill the gap in the Supreme Court, President Trump has decided to bring people to support our close-up elections as Congress control may be removed from the Republicans' hands after the vote in November.
How much time does President Trump hold a rally tonight in West Virginia and how can he be followed online?
Trump's rally in Wheels, West Virginia is 7pm. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch President Trump's rally live in West West through YouTube.
Trump may be referring to the hearing of Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, who was assigned to the Supreme Court, which has become a source of tension over allegations of sexual activity so that the Senate's confirmation vote is expected to be suspended for a week until the FBI investigation is concluded.
But the main reason for this rally is to help the Republicans have a limited control over the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign organizers say the five rallies held this week are "to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and extend the majority of the Senate and the House of Public Opinion," says Reuters.
"The control of Congress is vital for its programs and the President prefers to travel to as many states as possible before entering the hot campaign season," said President Trump's campaign spokesperson, who doesn't register with Reuters.
The plan is at Wesbanco Arena holding the rally tonight, which could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and help journalists from Pittsburgh," says the West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday was the second day Mr. Trump visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the victory in 2016.
Trump's goal is to help Mr. Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who is lagging behind in a formal investigation.
“It’s not good for Mr. Morrisey to see the president forced to try to encourage him to increase the number of polls,” says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Dear Cup 2018: Team USA shows that it has the energy to fight if it faces a one-person war on Sunday
After all these extreme three games, Ryder Cup is probably waiting for this match to be played by four people on Saturday afternoon.
The idea that sports events are sports wheels is simply a concept, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
So who can block if they are asked?
"They had six benefits there, but now they have only four points, that's probably the way we can block a little bit," Jordan Spieth said before starting the day with the small races.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, leading to four points and still has twelve numbers to fight.
Americans, according to Spieth, seem to feel there is a small breeze helping their boats and a lot of reasons why they get encouragement, it's no less important than the strength of Spieth and Justin Thomas who has played together all day together and has won three points of four.
Spieth's play from tee to green is devastating and shows the good examples to follow.
His glaring voice grew stronger as his turn went on, and he killed an important putt and won a clear victory in the fourth match with neither Thomas nor Thomas in two numbers after the double match.
Similarly, he took the castt to victory at the 15th pit, the kind of cry that the American team has not yet fallen.
“It’s necessary to be persistent and care only for your game,” Spieth says.
The two players now have what is left.
She's 18 hole to write her name.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have more numbers than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days, which is the inevitable story of Ryder Cup.
Both seem to have four points in the four games that are pretty and pretty from Europe, and will never make mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only two people who didn't fire bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also left the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back on Friday morning.
This long-term effort, and the discovery of their energy by these proud spectators, seems to confirm that they are the players who need to be defeated on Sunday, and that there will be no fanring players because of thewood or Molinari can win the European victory while the Le Golf National is sunset.
At best they get it together but with different holes.
However, it's still too early to talk about European victories.
While with Alex Noren, Sergio Garcia, the king of the fourballs, was quickly packed by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson in the morning.
The Espagnol and the Swedish were thrown into a pit and lost two doubles on the front.
On Sunday, however, no one is expected to pull you out of the pit.
It is interesting to see the nearest fourballs and Rauromes for cooperation between the two players, their mutual advice, their silent advice and the potential change of strategy in an instant.
So far, Europe's team has played a very good game and it has an outstanding advantage if they enter the last days but it also shows that the Team USA has the energy to fight despite concerns, including those in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 to the last day of the Dear Cup · Global Voices
Europe has a good way to go on the last day of the Cup when it won the United States 10-6 after theurballs and Rarsomes matches on Saturday.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, a regular team of new ideas, led by two victories against a busy Tiger Woods, increasing the number to four in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorgon, which aims to hold their release in Hazeltine two years ago, never allowed the American who refused to be edited during the day, leading 3-1 to the game.
The Americans were more aggressive during the season, winning in two games, but they failed to minimize their lateness.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to hold its cup, it needs eight points during a 12-person match on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European recruiting player to win four consecutive numbers, while he and Molinari were alone, many were called "Molliwood" after the spectacular weekend, the second two to win four points in the opening game of Ryder Cup's story.
When they hit Woods and Patrick Reed with aurballs, they triumphed in a beautiful way over the already snowy Woods and US draft Bryson Dechambeau with an even bigger number 5&4.
Woods, who has been so slow for two games on Saturday, seemed suddenly bright but has already won 19 fourballs and hardomes in 29 years and has already lost more than seven times.
When Justin Rose was resting for the fourballs in the morning, he was returned with Henrik Stenson during the Enqueromes and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – top and third place worldwide.
It wasn't all right but what Europe did even though the day in southwestern Paris was pleasant and windy.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three major awards, set the standard for Americans when Saturday got two points.
They won the 2&1 victory against Jon Rahm and Ian Pouter from Spain in the fourballs and returned and defeated Pourter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in the fouromes even though they had lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team pulled out of four defeats starting the one-person match, even if it's a similar match that Furyk's team will hold their awards.
Although they were the second to two days in the second place, they seemed unable to bear the outcome of the war on Sunday.
North Korea's 'Farin' says it will destroy their weapons alone without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if the sanctions continue, their trust in the United States will be reduced and that the country may be willing to give up its nuclear weapons alone.
In front of the annual conference, Mr. Ri Yong announced that North Korea has been taking "a huge step of commitment" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and nuclear testing, destruction of nuclear reactors, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“We don’t see any appropriate responses from the United States,” he says.
"If we don't trust the US, we will have no assurance of defending our country, and if this is the case, it would be unthinkable for us to decide alone to destroy our first weapons."
Although Mr Ri has repeated North Koera's usual complaints about Washington's opposition to the "step-up" mechanism for the elimination of nuclear weapons that will reward North Korea for each step, his statement seems to be unique because he has no longer rejected the elimination of the uncontrolled nuclear weapons, as is the case with Pyongyang before.
Mr. Ri repeated the joint statement of Mr. Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between the incumbent American President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try to achieve "the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula", while President Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought to officially end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first resign from nuclear weapons.
Washington also disagreed with calls to mitigate the severe international image of North Korea.
"The United States insists on "the elimination of nuclear weapons first" and further reinforces the pressure imposed on sanctions to achieve its goal in the crackdown, so as to oppose the "end-up declaration of war," Ri says.
"The fact that the sentence will bring us to our knees means people don't know us at all.
The problem is that the more these sanctions continue, the more our distrust grows."
Mr. Ri did not discuss the plan for the second summit between Mr. Kim and Trump as outlined by the US President earlier this week.
The Minister pointed out that three meetings between Mr. Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the last five months, and added: "If South Korea is not the United States to discuss the nuclear weapons elimination, then the elimination of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula does not seem to be the case."
However, in his speech in comparison to last year, Mr Ri spoke in a very different way, when he said in front of the United Nations General Assembly that the U.S. targeting of North Korea's fusées was no longer inevitable after Trump called Mr. Kim "homme-fusée" as a suicide mission.
While President Trump was facing the UN this year, which warned that North Korea would "completely destroy" North Korea last year, he praised Mr. Kim for taking measures to eliminate weapons, but said there was still a lot of work ahead of him and that the sentence would be met with impunity until North Koreans removed his nuclear weapons.
Trump said last Wednesday he didn't have a clear date to finish it, but he said "it would take two years, three or five months – it doesn't matter at all."
China and Russia said the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its performance.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pom speaking to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday stated: "The application of the sanctions announced by the Security Council must be strictly and without stopping until we are able to eliminate, completely, and with the possibility of justifying nuclear weapons."
The Council of Security has spoken in full force to increase the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to try to stifle funding for the nuclear and diplomatic program in Pyongyang.
At the UN General Assembly, Mr. Pomness met with Mr. Ri and later announced that she would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Mr. Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not so good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said the negotiations were advancing, but within hours North Korea accused him of "approaching the same way as criminals."
When North Korean met with Mr Moon this month, it announced that it would destroy a factory and a nuclear reactor if the US took "a similar stance."
Mr. Kim told him that our "continuation" is the guarantee that Mr. Trump promised protection in Singapore and a measure to restore relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn a lesson on sufficient rest
In a new lesson presented to Harvard University’s top-schooler this year, students are increasing their sleep to try to combat the culture of self-harm as a result of a 'night' education motivated by a café.
One researcher found that students at the world’s best university often don’t know what is the simplest measure they need to worry about.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created this lesson, which is believed to have been unprecedented in the United States.
After giving a talk on the impact of lack of sleep in the way of education, she thought about creating the lesson.
'When the presentation was finished, a young woman approached and said, 'Why is it that someone tells me this, already in the third year?'
No one told him anything about the importance of sleeping – and it's surprising," he told The Telegraph.
In this lesson, which started this year for the first time, it explains to students the basics of sleep habits that contribute to education and exercise, while improving life in general.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health department, said that the university decided to include the study when it became apparent that students had very little sleep for a week.
The one-hour study includes a series of exciting activities.
In one episode, students need to expect photos of coffee cups, windows, trainers and books and they are informed about the consequences of cafés and light and the lack of sleep impact on sports achievements, and finally the importance of sleep habits.
In another episode, participants are told that prolonged sleep shortages can lead to strokes, strokes, depression and cancer.
When a map of the campus is mapped, there are links, encouraging participants to reflect on their daily habits.
'We know it won't change the way students live.
But we believe that it is their right to know – your right to learn about the health impact of smoking,' says Professor Czeisler.
The proud habit is still there when it 'sleeps all night', he says, adding that the lack of sleep is the result of modern technology and the growing pressures that students face.
Making sure that one’s body is enough to sleep, and a good quality sleep, should be the ‘secret weapon’ that students should use to fight stres, fatigue and anxiety, he says – yes, even to stop the fat from going to church, because lack of sleep tells the brain that he is starving, so he becomes hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old young man from California studying biochemical and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the lesson, as he had attended a lesson from him in the first year of Harvard.
This lesson opened her eyes and encouraged her to make the lesson available to the whole campus.
He hopes the next step is to send the 4th-year-old student to complete a similar program before entering the competitive stage.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should raise alarms for sleeptime and wake up, and be careful about the dangers of 'blue power' issued by electronic screens and LED lights, which could seriously disrupt the cycle of sleep and physical activity, and could cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mena's goal killed Gerrard's people
The Rangers suffered from the temporary absence of the city, and Steven Gerrard's team lost 1-0 defeat in Livingston, due to Dolly Menga's kick.
The Ibrox team hoped to win the first win outside the city since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone in September, but Gary Holt's team handed Gerrard the second defeat in the 18-member game, leaving his team behind eight in front of the Hearts team, the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Megan scored seven minutes before the holiday, and the Rangers team on the stadium seemed to have found no idea and was not expected to get up.
The Rangers, Livingston, have now dropped to the sixth place and only Hibernian is in front of the dead goal gap.
And the risks of Rangers could not stop there after the bruises on the head of Calim Specence, a character on the other side of the park, if someone threw something out of the stadium and he had to be treated first.
Gerrard has made eight changes to his team, which passed through Ayr and is part of the semifinal process for Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, didn't change the 11 Livi who won a score from Hearts last week and he might be happy to see his team that is already well-infused to crack down on rivals on each turn.
It may have been the Rangers who often occupied the ball but Livingston had a good chance to take advantage of the ball that went by.
They were supposed to have scored two minutes after the game started, as Menga made her first job and found Scott Pittman next to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the goal of the game's main game was so far away.
Later, Keaghhan Jacobs cut coup-franc from afar and saw the errand Craig Halkett but his friend's top kick Alan Lithgow hit the stake.
The Rangers finally managed the game but seemed to be more optimistic than their confidence in their third-time performance.
Alfredo Morelos was absolutely convinced that he and Steven Lawless had to get a pen when he clashed at the fifteenth minute, but judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian and his complaints.
During the first half of the Rangers, there were only two poles at the goal but there was little danger for Liam Kelly, a former goalkeeper of Ibrox, who found the offer from Lassana Couliba and the soft kick from Ovie Ejaria.
It may be true that Livi's first goal killed in 34th minute isn't the result of a good game, but everyone agrees it's worth it because of its creativity.
Rangers failed to face Jacobs' long-drilled game strategy.
Scott Arfield failed when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, and then it didn't miss out while looking for Menga, who scored a goal in a simple way.
Gerrard changed a little while off when he replaced Ryan Kent with Coulibaly, and it almost affected that player because Morelos was sitting on the side of the park, but the giant Kelly ran from her place suddenly to stop him.
Livingston has continued to pull these foreign teams out of their favorite game, and Lithgow and Halkett have repeatedly kicked in.
Howt's team managed to add the number to the last minute but McGregor's angle was perfect to stop Jacobs, before the ball left Lithgow's head away from the goal corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Ranger's successor, also asked for a pen, when Jacobs was wiped out, but here Thomson didn't even pay attention.
Alimanaka: Founder of Geiger Counter
Here's a page from Our Morning Family: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and ITOHY... that same day Johannes Wilhelm "Hanas" Geiger, who will later become a physicist, was born in Allemane.
Geiger invented a radioctivité test and survey, which later produced his invention called Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter has since become a science-based tool, and then has also become an important tool for pop culture, as seen in a video titled "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, with unexpected cowboys as scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter, used in ancient times in the research of radioactive minerals, such as urinium.
When you stick these listenings, you can actually hear the results of the high radioactivité in the stone."
Evans: "Well, he's really trying!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th anniversary.
But there is still something created with its name.
New readings for cancer that may be able to teach the defense forces 'see' patients
A new reading for cancer that may be able to teach the defense forces 'see' patients and kill them
In the process of treatment, the vaccine teaches the defense forces to identify the sick cells.
This system includes the removal of cells from the patient, and a slight change in the labo
They're next able to 'see' a protéine that is common in many types of cancers, then reintroduced into the body.
There was an attempt to find positive results for several patients with different cancers.
When a woman was diagnosed with this vaccine, she received a vaccine that teaches defense forces to identify patients, cancer in her fetus has disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the process, healthy cells are removed from the patient, changed to labo so that the protétin called HER2 of multiple cancers can “see” the body, then the cells will be reintroduced into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancerer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "In view of the outcome we have, this vaccine is very promising."
ER2 "referring to the growth of various types of cancer," including breast cancer, kindergarten, lungs and colonization," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach has been taken from the patient to "train" to target the cells of cancer, which have a bearing on a leucémia treatment.
Kanye West gave a long speech in support of Trump, while wearing a MAGA hat, after serving at SNL.
The Error of an End
The audience took Kanye West to the theater during the Saturday Night Live show after he gave a long speech praising American President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After his third song for that night, Ghost Town, which he sang in his cap Make America Great, gave a long speech criticizing the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people, and they say, "How do you like Trump, a racist person?"
If racism is a problem for me, I have long left America," she says.
In the beginning of the SNL program, there was a short comedy story of Hollywood star Matt Damon mocking Mr. Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Senate Law Commission, regarding the alleged criminal charges against Ms. Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast on the show, comedian Chris Rock posted a photo album of West's long speech on social networks.
It's unclear whether Rock's intention was to make fun of West by publishing that video.
West also complained to the audience that he was busy behind the stage because of his hat.
"They tortured me behind the stage.
They say, 'Don't wear that hat when they get out of the stage.'
They tortured me!
And they said my situation is hard now,” she says, as Washington Examiner reported.
West continues: "You want to find that difficult place?" he said, "I'll wear Superman's clothing, because it means you can't command me what I'm doing. Would you like the world to move forward?
Try love."
At least two times, viewers took his words and found that the SNL presenters seemed ashamed, according to the Variety report, and one person told the newspaper: "One house was speechless."
West was finally invited to replace the singer Arian Grande, who had previously been his friend Mac Miller, who had died a few days earlier.
West was fascinated by how the song I Love It was sung, and was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West got the support of TPUSA team officials, i.e. Candace Turner, who said to Tweeter: "For the most brave person: THANK YOU FOR THE THANK."
But Karen Hunter, a talk-show presenter, also told Tweeter oe "that's West's what he's doing is so much fun."
"But I chose NO to support people (to buy their clothes or songs, or to support their "arts") I found myself talking and conveying ideas that, in my opinion, hurt society.
He can do whatever he wants.
We too," he says.
The rapper, before the show, said on Twitter that he changed his name and that "it was he who is officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but he follows Diddy's example known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, came up with the name Snoop Lion, and the famous artist Prince changed his name to make him famous.
Someone is accused of murder near death at Death Belfast
A man was stabbed to death on Friday at the east of the Casturant Belfast, where a 45-year-old man was accused of murder.
It happened in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
The man will appear in Belfast on Monday.
The public ministry will consider the matter.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, is in his strength
Jon Snow is widely known for Kit Harington, the one who uses the sword in the Game of Thrones series, which has been a history of the past days of violence.
The 31-year-old actor showed that heroes are not polite. He said that this is why young men think that they need violence and strength to win respect.
Kit at Sunday Times Culture said "there's something wrong there", and wondered how men can be helped to escape the widespread destructive spirit of the #MeToo era.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, a woman who is playing with her in the 31-year-old Game of Thrones movie. She said she was "very ready" to help solve the problem.
‘I’m surprised why have we become wrong with this attitude about men?’ he said.
‘What have boys been taught when they grew up, causing this problem?’
Kit believes that television was one of the reasons why people have such a misogyny about men when they look at men's role in the film.
And he added: ‘What is a man’s character, and what have they been taught?
What is being taught on TV, and what boys on the street see that they have to do so if they want to be a real man?
Perhaps one of the most important questions we should answer is: How can we change that?
But there's really a problem with men.'
In the interview, he said that when Game of Thrones is over next summer, he will stop playing to do the next step or a little more, but he says ‘wars and horse races’ are done.
Kit will start playing a new movie next November, Sam Shepard's True West, which talks about a man who is a filmmaker and his brother who is a thief.
He said that meeting his wife, Rose, was one of the best things he played with Game of Thrones.
‘In this film I saw my wife, and that’s why I got a family and started my life,’ she says.
Rose played Ygritte's turn, the woman to whom Kit was interested when she played Jon Snow's part, during Emmy award-winning.
They were married in the land of Leslie's family in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: More than 14% of the reported cases in China · Global Voices
China says the population with AIDS has increased by 14%.
It has more than 820,000 people in the country, health officials say.
From May to July 2018 alone, it was reported that 40,000 people were affected.
Most of them were sexually transmitted to the disease, but it wasn't the same before.
Blood transfusions have caused the spread of the disease in some parts of China before.
However, at a conference in Yunnan, health officials in China said that almost no more people are infected with HIV because of blood transfusions.
In the past year, however, there have been over 100,000 HIV and AIDS cases in China.
The spread of HIV due to sex is a serious problem for gays and lesbians in China.
Same-sex couples have also been recognized legally in China since 1997, but these types of people are still widely discriminated against.
Thanks to the country's culture, studies show that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men are married to women.
Not enough protection from their sexual activities, which is why the disease is spreading.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has accepted HIV medication from other countries to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP staff did not reveal secret information about senateur and claims that there is "a very dangerous liar" somewhere "a conspiracy"
American Maxine Waters, on Saturday, reported that his staff had been falsely accused and said they revealed the secrets of the three American senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles democrat also claims that these secrets are revealed by right-wing people and websites that share the "last right-wing" idea.
"It's a terrible lie, lies and lies," Waters said, in what was shared on Twitter.
The releases are said to include personal addresses and phone numbers in the United States. The honored Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hutch, both from Utah.
The specific information was published online on Thursday, and the person who sent it was unknown, but it was revealed that it took place at a senator meeting in Capitol Hill, where a complaint against the morality of Brett Kavanaugh, who was eligible for the Supreme Court, was announced.
The explanations came shortly after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState say the IP address sent to the message came from Waters office, and published information about Water workers, The Hill said.
“There’s no evidence and there’s a complete lie,” Waters says.
"The people who work in me – who are hiding their identity after these allegations – have never published any explanation.
There is no evidence and this is a true lie."
His words have made people more critical of Waters, especially Maison Blanche's journalist, and Fleischer.
"His rejection is troubling," said Fleischer.
“It seems that he doesn’t have the necessary character to become a Congressman.
A person shouldn't be upset if he was falsely accused and didn't do it.
They should not be harsh.
He should not worry about the reason why he was accused.
He should be calm and calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of the Kavanaugh case, and the criticism he received as it turned out to be too angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican party, also commented on Twitter aimed at overcoming Waters' election positions.
“It’s really big,” he says.
Ms Waters said his office informed "the experienced authorities and law enforcement officials because of these allegations."
"We make sure the slanderers are found," he says, "and they will be punished legally for the atrocities they spread about people who work in me."
Johnny English is back – a humorous movie played by agent Rowan Atkinson
It's becoming common to think that the movie featuring English characters always has a sideline of Brexit, and that's exactly what happened to Johnny English- which was first released in 2003, Johnny English, and the aftermath that appeared in 2011 called Johnny English Reborn.
Will we only laugh if we are really being treated by people and they use us for export?
Whatever the case, we know that Johnny English, who is neither smart nor funny, has renewed his contract with the work. It is best known for the comic films made for people who don't speak English.
He is a poorly qualified spy who thinks he is very beautiful, that he has some to look at Clouseau, and that there is a part to see him as Mr Bean. There is something special about the anthem of Chariot du feu that was played as the opening song of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
The character's turn was inspired by a film about Atkinson, a traveler from around the world. The film was previously aired on Barclaycards TV, but is now unknown to anyone.
There is one or two good things for this JE to come out soon.
I would like to see Johnny English approach the helicopter and wear an ex-military uniform, and the thing that rotates around the helicopter hit his head's helmet.
Even Atkinson's face is funny, but the movie is not funny and it seems that it was just forced to laugh, though humor is the main thing to do in movies such as 007 and Missionsible.
It's like it's meant to make fun of children, not adults. I think it's not better than the funny movie he made when he's a Kenyan Johnny English.
But, in light of the current situation, Britain has a serious problem.
An Internet spy has used people to find British networks, so he knows who the British spies are, who discouraged the police officer who was working at the time – a small role Kevin Eldon played.
This led to a great deal of history for the well-known and controversial prime minister, but there are no supporters. Emma Thompson tried to do what he could to play Teresa's turn, but he did nothing.
His adviser informed him that all their secret agents were identified, so he would have to pick up a full-time spy.
It was meant to make Johnny English proud, who became a teacher at a school for people with money, and to train him to become a spy: a comic story, because English was doing it as a spy school.
English was once taken to Whitehall and saw old friends, Bough, Ben Miller's role.
Bough has already married and works for people in the sea, who appear to be an honorable woman: Vicki Pepperdine’s role.
Batman and Robin, therefore, are back in cooperation, doing wrong when they pursue the Queen's Intelligence, and meeting Ophelia Bulletova, the game of Olga Kurylenko, a beautiful and powerful young woman.
Meanwhile, the prime minister was deceived when a man claiming to be rich and able to solve the problem of the spy online, Jason Volta, who was played by Jake Lacy.
To begin with, English and Bough's journeys, they dressed as waiters, burned French hotels, and found trouble on Volta's boat, and English got into trouble after learning to use acasque to give them a mental picture of Volta's house.
We'll see in the next part of the story, although it's cool and funny, there's still a TV show for children to do so.
Just be balanced.
When I saw this movie Johnny English coming out, I thought: Atkinson should have a role in making his real identity heard when he was playing a movie.
The workers refused to put up a pen for four British workers a week to earn a salary for a five-day worker.
Jeremy Corbyn's party plans to implement the project to make British work four days a week while earning a salary of five days.
The union said factory owners should transfer the money stored for the technological development of giving them extra holidays.
It will give three days off for the weekend but it will be paid.
The source says the idea is consistent with the union project's vision to benefit workers.
The Trade Party Congress agreed to allow employees to work for only four days in a week so that they could benefit from economic change.
A long-time member of the Labor Union told The Sunday Times: "The announcement of new leadership is expected before the end of the year.
‘It will not take place for night workers but the demand is good, only work for four days a week, so that the trade union will bring in economic conversations and benefit to workers and the industry’s industrial model.'
Not only did the Labor Union have this idea, but the Green Party also promised that it would only work four days during its 2017 election campaign.
The petition has not yet been fully presented by the Labor Union.
A representative of the labor union said: "It is not a trade union management that only works four days a week and that the union hasn't really considered."
Chancellier John McDonnell took advantage of a job conference last week to explain his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell says he's ready to join forces with "undirect directors" and those who "appreciated profits" in big factories.
The current Chancellier project also means that the partners of the water companies may not be able to repay all the money they have used because the state would take away land prices if there were just a small wrong gesture.
He also plans to establish a clear space for the company's staff and dedicate full amount of money to the factory to provide the same government to private companies up to 10 percent, which involves more than 500 £.
"60 minutes" says Lindsey Graham, and John Kennedy if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh will help us change our mind
The FBI investigation into his charges delayed at least a week's last election on the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, and questioned whether the office's findings would motivate Republican senators to stop supporting him.
In a controversial Sunday interview, "60 minutes", journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if anything the FBI can publish and change their opinion.
Kennedy spoke more than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy says.
“I’m coming to court,” I told him, speaking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, and the announcement came out, and said, ‘Am I doing that?’
He's determined, ready, inconvenient."
Graham's choice is stable, however.
“My mind doesn’t change when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it’s going to be with a heavy duck,” he says.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I know is that: "The Bretts firmly rejected it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people he called couldn’t confirm that.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new and change."
What is the Citizens' March and What's the result of reducing Poverty?
New York will host the Citizen March next Saturday, an annual music event in which many artists will be able to rally for and raise awareness; reduce world poverty.
For the seventh year, the Citizens' March will find more than ten thousand people in Central Park's main square, not only to enjoy concerts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to join the movement that leads to the goal of reducing poverty by 2030.
The Citizen March, in 2012, expanded the World Poverty Project, an international ideological body expected to end poverty by increasing the number of people involved in the fight against it.
To get free tickets for the event (if you don't want to buy tickets for the VIP), viewers will need to do a lot of things, or do jobs like volunteering, forwarding information to world leaders, making phone calls or other ways to help raise awareness about their goals, fighting poverty.
But the success of citizens around the world over the past 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is giving free tickets to people so that they can convince them to support the call for the event, or is it just the so-called "clicktivism" - people can better understand difference when writing names for online demands and simply posting calls?
Since 2011, citizens have said it has documented almost 19 million projects from its supporters, which prompted it to push forward with another goal.
It has been reported that these activities have helped a lot of world leaders to reach an agreement and to invest $37 million to save the lives of more than 2,25 million to 2030 people.
In early 2018, the group quoted an agreement and a statement of 390, expressing the results of their work, at least 10 billion dollars have already revolted and returned.
The group suggests that the funding directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Part of the agreement included the Food Price (The Power of Nutrition), English donors and farmers agreed to work together to "help children grow legally", and promised to give Rwanda $35 million in aid to combat malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 voices from citizens.
"With the support of the English government, volunteers, the state, and citizens like you, we will be able to put "the suffering of malnutrition" into historical footnotes, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the public during his concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities by the U.K to improve the food for mothers and children, the government said it would provide funds for the project "The Power of Nutrition", which will help greatly food to enable mothers and 5 million children to enjoy it.
In response to the question on its website, "Why do you believe that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Most citizens responded: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall, we may fail.
However, like ethnic conflicts and anti-racism movements before us, we'll win because we'll be stronger if we're united.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, is among those who will participate in this year's event in New York, where Deborra- Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will take part.
The US could use the Navy as a “block” to avoid exporting energy - Secretary of Interior
"If necessary," Washington could appeal to its navy to prevent Russia's energy from spreading in the market, including in the Middle East, according to U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Observer.
Zinke says Russia's deal with Syria - if noted, happened during the invitation to legitimate governments - is just a way to explore new energy markets.
“I think that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to spend the energy they did in Europe, the mineral resources in the south of Europe,” he adds.
And, as the honored man said, there is good judgment in the way and in the means that are able to bear.
"The United States of America, with its navy, can prove that shipping is open and even if it is necessary to close it so that they can't get out of the market," he says.
Zinke asked the attendees to turn to America, an NGO that holds the "power consumers voice".
He went comparing Washington’s plan with Russia and Iran, noting that the two are actually the same.
"The economic choice, whether Iran or Russia, is, to say, to support and replace oil, he says, while comparing Russia with "a jokerback" with an economy based on fossil fuels.
The announcement came as Trump’s delegation helped boost the export of natural gas in Europe, instead of Russia, the much easier for European consumers.
Indeed, Trump's administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have convinced Germany to withdraw from the uncivilised project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a prey to Moscow."
Moscow insists that the North Stream 2 billion US dollars-long channels are meant to double the tolerance of nearly 110 billion cubes, a pure economic project.
The Kremlin explained that Washington’s relentless opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and shows a bad example of competition with injustice.
"I think we all agree that energy should not be used to put pressure on the energy and consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The place of America has made Germany return and strengthen its commitment to the project.
The leader of German industry organizations, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with the European Union's handling of energy and the two agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had serious problems when a third state interfered with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a joint meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will "focus" on presidential candidacy by 2020
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that she "will concentrate" on running for president in the next election.
At a meeting in Holyoke Massachusetts, Warren talked about his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington, save our government and attack women in the elite," reports The Hill.
"I will look closely at the presidential elections, after November 6."
Warrren even singled out Donald Trump at a meeting at the city hall saying that he "takes his country to the wrong direction.
"I really worry about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he says.
Warren is very popular in his criticism of Trump and the politician of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a call on Friday, Warrren said, "Of course we need the FBI investigation before the election."
A Thursday survey showed that most of Warren's members do not agree to stop in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the "safe" voters from Massachusetts said senators should not fall, according to Suffool/ Boston Globe poll University's Political Research Institute.
Thirty-two percent agree with his candidacy.
Studies show that there are many supporters of the former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38 percent support him in the competition and 48 percent unsupported.
Several other Democratic figures have been debated that it would be a 2020 contest for Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his decision in January according to a report by the Association of Journalists.
Sarah Palin describes her anxiety at Donald Trump's rally:
Zr Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with raping in the homes of people on Monday night
"All that my children go through, they will again forget, I can tell any family who remembers the pain of anxiety and some of the wounds of our soldiers returning from war," he told listeners during Trump's demonstration in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephants in the desert" and says of his children and many veterans "they changed from there, they became very hard, and wondered if there was any respect for his fellow soldiers and air crews, and other members of the army, to the country."
On Monday, in Wasilla, Alaska, a police department spokesman in Wasilla, was accused of sexual assault against a woman with weapons and weights, according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman in Wasilla.
18 D.C. support countries support the rejection of a new policy
The 18-year-old state and Columbia District are demanding legal challenges for a new U.S. national policy to refuse asylum for victims fleeing crime or domestic violence.
A representative of 18 countries and districts demanded that the president's Friday in Washington support of asylum seekers protesting against politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of Grace v. The U.S.'s verdict on federal policy has not been announced.
She says her partner and children who were part of the aggressor killed her but the U.S. government refused her request to take shelter on July 20
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Grace's lawyers made it clear that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, are the ones that lead petitioners to U.S. asylum, such as countries that face serious problems with criminals and domestic violence.
The U.S. news policy cancelled the decision of the Council of State Security in 2014 that allowed illegal immigrants to escape domestic violence in order to enforce asylum.
The Columbia district, Attorney Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not ignore the state’s decades of, federal and international rights."
"A federal law requires that all courts conform to the facts and circumstances, and the system that opposes this order," said the court's supporters.
The lawyer suggested that the policy of denying immigrants is detrimental to the American economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and "to provide physical assistance."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered migrant migrants to stop supporting victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asila is here for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of inequality in race, religion, nationality, or members of a particular social group or political expression", the secretary said in a statement on June 11.
The escape zone is not intended to solve everyone – even serious issues – that people around the world face.
The temporary relief effort in Palu is discouraging if the dead have doubled as they try to find survivors
For survivors, the situation worsened.
"So hard," says Mrs. Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her newly born daughter with malaria at a evacuation center in the town of Palu.
"There are always ambulances arriving every minute, transporting corpses.
don't have any clean water."
Residents returned to their homes for the first time, took the reservoirs, and picked up the materials available.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were destroyed in the 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a spinal and shoulders broken, stayed in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where hospital patients were treated severely.
She bursts into tears as she describes the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth floor where she and her daughter were living.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I thought I couldn't move on the wall," Hasis told the collective media, he went to the ville to go to his family's wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but I was suddenly silent.
I don’t know what happened to her and my children.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. Embassy accused China of "harmful" propaganda.
A week after the Chinese official newspaper, they published four-page ads in an American newspaper expressing the US-Sina trade benefits, accusing the US embassy in China in Beijing of using the American press to spread the word.
US President Donald Trump - the most popular newspaper in Iowa's place - spoke on Wednesday about the China Daily's help to the Monines Register - when he accused China of wanting to enter the Congress on November 6.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has disturbed the American election noted what US officials have said to Reuters: a new step in developing Washington’s campaign for pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are common to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting commercially for the same right to export.
China’s earlier crackdown on importing countries like Iowa that supported the Trump Republic Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important agricultural entrepreneur in China, said Beijing injured employees, farmers and businesses in the United States.
In an article published in the newspaper Des Moines on Sunday, Branstad wrote to China: "He now doubles the threat by spreading advertising in free media.
"On airing its campaign, the Chinese government uses a beloved tradition of free speech and media freedom by setting up paid ads through the Des Moines list, "as Brantad has written.
"On the other hand, on Beijing’s newspaper, you can see the number of indefinite dissidents and you can’t see the optimism of the Chinese public’s views on China’s economic security incidents, hard control. The Chinese Communist Party, as it is written, is not going to be the same as China’s people.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has turned down the article's service", although he did not directly mention the newspaper.
Observers warned the Republic to take refuge with voters before nine years old with the Kavanaugh case.
Many Republicans are supporting and protecting candidates for the Brett Kavanaugh tribunal, in front of many declarations about sexual harassment, one observer warned that they will show us a strong ewel, especially against women, during the upcoming elections.
The result of this situation is very strong and most Republicans have already announced they want to vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syrakuse University, expressed confidence in The Hill, an article published on Saturday.

"The girls won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and even in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the country's senator and spokesman, according to the Washington news agency, DC.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted, "The month of November!" as they showed in the National Assembly law when Republicans chose to hand over Kavanaugh's appointment to the Judge's Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, said Mic.
"The promotement of democracy and the motivation for democracy will not be included on the board," says Stu Rothenberg, a politically neutral analyst on the news site.
“People say they’re getting bigger; and it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially rural voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, even if they don't like the president, usually don't vote.
Even before Ford's testimony of his accusations against the Supreme Court's candidate for sexual assault, analysts have argued that the answer could arise if the Republic moves forward with its emphasis.
"It caused confusion for GOP," said Michael Stele, president of the former republic's national committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"Not only the election of the committee or the recent election, nor the establishment of Kavanaugh, but also the way Republicans did and how they handled it, "Guy Cecil, director of the Prizes USA, a group that helps the elected democracy, told the television.
However, Americans seem to be divided between who should believe his testimony but Ford's testimony is more religious than Kavanaugh's.
YouGov’s survey found that 41% of the population who sinned believe in or do not believe in the Ford testimony, while 35% said they believe they don’t belong to Kavanugh.
Moreover, 38% said Kavanaugh was lying in his testimony, 30% said that Ford's case was the same.
After Flake was violated, the FBI investigated the charges issued by Ford and other accusers Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the senator court committee during his oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17.
Ramirez announced that the Supreme Court's candidate had shown her genitalia during her graduation in Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet connection used on Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, has launched a campaign that competes with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest tech campaign, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Soid allows users to choose where they will use data stored and who can access information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of "Inrupt" was "the world rule."
“We have to do this,” she says to the new company.
"It's a special moment."
The program uses high-tech technology to enable people to create their own "speciality on the Internet" or POD.
There may be a list of related items, calendars, music lists, and other special and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available only for one "navigateur" at a time.
What distinguishes online data websites from their own is the ability of users to access different kinds of information.
The company calls it "a special effort by data."
According to company CEO John Bruce, the goal of Inrupt is to provide the resources, skills and expertise to make it available to all.
The current company Berners-Lee, Bruce, is the security sector purchased by IBM, where entrepreneurs work on projects and volunteer communities.
Starting this week, tech users around the world can create their own app using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google" to make a complete change that will change their business model in the near future.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Medium article published last Saturday, Berners-Lee said, "The volunteer mission is to provide commercial and environmental energy to protect the dignity and quality of new news websites."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when launching the World Wide Web Conversation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, Berners-Lee has been involved in discussions about the lack of Internet.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Conversation, the site's construction and Open Data Institute.
"I really hope in this new era of the web," Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating Victoria's First World War Cross · Global Voices
The only cleric in the Church of England won the Victoria cross during World War I as a fighter in his home town 100 years later.
Senator Colonel The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He did not know that he received an honor from the English army but was shot dead four days later by a professional shooter.
A monument was presented by two of his grandsons during the parade in Nortra Beachshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, says the 100-year-old monument is "an important feature of history" after the war that became known to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, the confederate-ocloniel Van led his troops on the Saint-Quentin channel, amid "a thick bell and gun that exploded across the battlefield", on September 29, 1918.
Then he ran to the shooting point, and in his "most typical and dignified manner" he led the group ahead of him, and then he was the one who shot himself and killed three people from the enemy group.
German professional firefighters killed the lieutant-canonel Vann on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says he "will never be able to imitate" what his grandfather did, making him "humble."
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also crowned a crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he was "very happy to participate in the parade", and he added that "a person is very brave if there are so many supporters."
MMA supporters went to sleep to watch Bellator 206; but Peppa Pig appeared
Imagine that you stayed awake and enjoyed watching Bellator 206, but then you won't be allowed to watch the most interesting show.
There were 13 wars on San Jose’s schedule, and six of them were very interesting, and they were sent to the UK for a whole night, on Canal 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, however, when Gegard Mousai and Rory MacDonald were prepared to fight, British viewers were surprised and surprised because the show suddenly changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were surprised because they had gone to bed just to watch the competition.
One commenter said on Twitter that the children's cartoon is "very bad joke."
"According to the state's law, the program is not due to be broadcast at 6 am. It is forced to change the program for children," said Dave Schwartz, deputy head of Bellator trade and communication.
"Peppa the pig," ie."
Bellator's president Scott Crower said he would consider the British audience in the next session.
Cker says he "thought to send it back," and "seek a solution."
"But it was Sunday at 6:00 a.m., so we couldn't solve the problem until Sunday’s time came.
But we are looking for a solution.
We felt that the message was received a lot, and most of those who wrote it were not happy.
We are trying to resolve the problem now. We thought it was a technical issue,
It's a public problem.
We promise that these examples will not happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of competitions to five and not six more. We're already doing this, but we're trying to please the audience, but it's going to go over again.
It's very sad too."
Diska Desert Island: Tom Daley felt "no less" than others
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he felt "no less" when he grew up because he liked men, but that's why he decided to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy says he was in high school before he realized that "there was no one like him."
He commented on the program that Lauren Laverne offers to Radio 4 Desert, saying that people who love men and women have rights, and that she wants to give someone a "hope" to others.
He also said that when he had children, it became less important for him to win the Olympics.
The host, Kirsty Young, took several months off work because he was sick.
Daley appeared to be a shipwreck on his first program with Laverne, saying he felt "less" when compared to others when he grew up because "the society didn't accept gays, or lesbians."
She says: "I always felt inferior to others, but this is what today gives me strength and makes me determined to succeed."
He wanted to show people that he was "made" so that people wouldn't be so frustrated when they know he loves men.
He received two bronze medals and wanted to support LGBT. He appeared in front of many people during the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, and took the opportunity to say that he should expand all countries and not ban LGBTs.
She said she spoke because she knew she was lucky, because she was not blamed for being allowed to be with a man freely, so she wanted to give someone "hope".
The winner of the World Cup three times said he fell in love with a man. It was the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013. "I didn't expect."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years old. He said he doesn't have a problem with the difference of the year.
“When you’re going to experience a variety of things when you’re still young—he participated in the first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – it’s hard to find someone your age who was hit by something similar to what happened to you.”
They had children in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said things changed his "looks and vision."
"If you asked me last year, I would say "let me win the gold medal", he said.
"But you see, there's something more important than gold medals.
Robbie is my gold medal."
The son bears his grandfather's name. He died at the age of 40 in 2011, when his brain was diagnosed with cancer.
Daley says his father never agreed that he would die, and the last thing he asked was to get a ticket to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit first to see his son.
I couldn't tell him, "You won't be in the first place to watch me."
“I kept her arm after she gave up her life. When she gave up and I died, I realized that she could be defeated,” she says.
Daley participated in the Olympic Games the following year, in 2012, and won the copper medal.
“That’s my dream from an early age, that I’ll swim in front of a lot of people in Olympic games. I’m so happy,” she says.
That is also what inspired him when he chose his song – Proud de Heather Small - which gave him strength during preparations for the Olympic Games. He was still very scared.

Mickelson was denied entry to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will try to find his best on Sunday, playing the 47th game of Dear Cup, but he must try to compensate for his actions so that it doesn't become a major defeat.
Mickelson participated in the 12th annual event, but was removed by Capital Jim Furyk because of the four goals on Saturday.
Although it should be the focus of many, like in the United States, he has been with the gill pot for the whole day, and has tried to correct his mistakes.
It's not easy to lead, even if it's already very popular. It's 48 years old and the Golf National match is not suitable for him, because if it doesn't work, it's completely lost.
Although the place is hard to play, she will face British famous Francesco Molinari in the eighth match she will play on Sunday, which was accompanied by the four winners this week, which is Tommy Fleetwood.
Mickelson's game is very important, especially when he tries hard at the start, since the U.S. team lost four times in 12 simple games.
Furyk says that his players are so confident that he won’t say so much.
“He knows what he’s going to do today is very important. He beat me a little, he hugged me and said I’m ready for tomorrow’s match,” Furyk said.
“He’s very confident.
He's one of the most popular Temple players, and he has been helping his team since this week.
I didn’t think he would play twice.
But I hoped he would play more than that. But this is the fact that we believe it should be done.
He wanted to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will get more mark than Nick Foldo in the Ryder Cup match on Sunday.
This could be his last moment playing with Ryder Cup, where he will have the most important mark on all the games he has played since.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost an intervenante 20 times and won 7 times, although Furyk says his arrival made the team so lively.
“He’s funny even though he’s a bit sarcastic, very clever, he likes to laugh others, it’s nice to have him on the team,” he says.
“I think he and the young people in the team were happy this week, and it was great to see that.
He's not just playing, he's very generous."
European team captainThomas Bjorn knows they could lose.
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn, from his experience, knows that even if they are bringing a little lead before the match between two players on the last day of Ryder Cup, it can be very difficult to make it.
The Danish game was first played in 1997 in Valderrama, when the Sve Ballesteros team won five above the U.S. team, but it only reached the stage. They won 141⁄2-13 1⁄2.
"You always remind yourself that we were taking the lead in Valderrama, leading us to Brookline, where we were defeated, and in Valderrama where we won, but now we can," Bjorn says, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So stories will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
Tomorrow, you put forth your maximum effort.
Go to the stadium and do all the right thing.
It's not over yet but we're still looking for signs to stick to the chart.
Our goal is to win the cup, and that's where we focus.
I've always said from the beginning that I'm focusing on 12 players, but we also know that one of the best in the world is against us."
Bjorn was happy to play his controversial golf court play, and he added: "I shouldn't think I'd be good enough about this.
It's impossible for the future to be released.
After all, tomorrow you may play with each other, something totally different.
It’s nice to play together when everything’s okay, but only when you’re asked to play golf can you see.
That's the message you need to send to the players, let's give your best tomorrow.
Don't think of your friend, but let him give him his best."
Unlike Bjorgon, though, Furyk did not like, because he wanted everyone to try to give him their best, as they did when they were with friends, but he singled out Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, because he won three points in the four games.
Furyk was present at the end of these momentous and complex days, from the team that won in Brooklyn before winning it when Europe rejected "Miracle at Medinah."
"I sold all the shit inside," he explained how Ben Crenshaw, a captain in 1999, lost the players on the last day of the match.
"There are 12 major games tomorrow, but you should be prepared immediately and start building this example of what you saw in Brooklyn, just like what you saw in Medinah.
This rush, as it goes on the other side, exerts a lot of pressure on the game in their bodies.
Then we line up and the kids wear whatever fashion we want, you see, tomorrow we'll do a miracle.
Thomas tried to lead the match against Rory Mcllroy in the toughest match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pouter, the European elite in his ranking.
"I voted for this group following this line because I think it's the one who can make it up to the end," Bjorn explained his choice for the two players' match.
Germany's new warships have been delayed again
The German army's new ship to replace the warship in the Cold War was supposed to arrive in 2014, but it would not be there until at least a year due to construction and rising prices according to media reports.
Using "Rheinland-Pfalz," the arrival of a boat leader from the Biden-Wuertemberg class was delayed to mid-2019, as a military spokesman for the newspaper Die Zeit explained.
The boat was supposed to have been used in the Navy in 2014, but due to its transportation problems, the planned project was damaged.
The four ships considered Biden-Wuerttemberg returned by the Navy in 2007 to replace the aging species of whaling vessels.
It is clear that they will launch a powerful rocket, a kind of fighter jet, a ship, and a tech spy, like a small radar that can be hidden, with a radio and a specialian.
His long maintenance is also a special feature, perhaps the release of these new ships in the port for the next two years.
However, a series of delays means that the latest warships thought to reflect German influence overseas will be wasted by the time it was used, as noted by Die Zeit.
The lucky F125 ship of F125 became the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to use it and returned it to the port of Blom & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy had returned ships to its manufacturer.
The reason for her deportation is unclear, but the German media says that the ship's struggle with missions was "incompetent and physical failure".
The technical failure is a serious problem as 120 seamen take the ships of Baden-Wuertemberg less than half the number of people carrying the type of ship they used to carry.
In addition, it is clear that the boat was too heavy to reduce its toll and that its special maritime reforms had become limited.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are twice as heavy as the same ship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to physical failure, the total cost of the project has also become a problem, including training sailors in power.
It is estimated that at first it reached 3.1 billion euros (or 3.6 billion dollars), rather than 2.2 billion euros.
The problems faced by new ships have become especially important as recent warnings that Germany's marine power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy "will no longer have high and sufficient ships."
The official said the problem grew even more as the old ships were no longer used and no new ship was given to replace them.
He even complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg ships could be used for the Navy.
National Trust identifies bats' secrets
A new research conducted in Scottland's tropical region shows how bats hunt food in rural plains.
Hopefully, the study will shed light on how the only flying mammal lives and will help in any future natural work.
The scientific research at the National Trust in Scotland will focus on the usual and syruples," as well as the brown trousers and the Daubbeton bats in Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
A special person will be sent to the site to record the behaviors and lives of bats during the period.
The NHS staff and several volunteers will also conduct a free investigation using manual surveillance.
The professionals will then use the records, including the call of a bat and what kind of species this species is.
There will then be a photo of bats ’ residence and reports to create a photo of how they react in the countryside.
According to Rob Dewar, NTS consultant and naturalist, the results of the search include where the bats are most useful and how they live in each species.
This will help to understand the benefits of the management of these habitats, such as creating bush and how forested areas for bats and other species can be processed as well.
The bats in Scotland and across Britain have been found to have survived for centuries.
They are threatened by high-rises and various development activities that damage their nests and habitats.
Light and energy machines, such as deadly paper and other chemicals used in building materials, can also be dangerous, as well as a cat that could catch her.
The bats, however, are not blind.
However, because he is a hunting animal at night, his ears are more active than his eyes to catch his prey.
He uses sophisticated and complex techniques to shed light on the insects he meets and the problems he might encounter in the flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, take care of bats.
She has ten professionals, conducting regular investigations, monitoring and sometimes even saving.
The organization even put Scotland in the Threeave National Park in Dumfries and Galloway, eight of the ten species of bats from Scotland.
The land’s manager, David Thompson, said that it was the ideal place for them.
"In Threave we have a place for bats, he says.
"We have many buildings, lots of ancient trees and a suitable place to live in.
But there is still much that is not known about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more fully what they need to grow quickly."
He stressed that it is important to control the bats before maintenance in the area as the possibility of the accident of a pregnancy alone could kill 400 female bats and their babies, and could eliminate entire local rats.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, torture them or destroy their nests.
Elishabeth Farrell, who was selected as the Special Director of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, urged the public to donate.
He said: "There are still so many things we need to know about bats and, for most of our species, we just don't know what their groups are."
Ronaldo denies her rape charges and lawyers decided to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo asserted that the charges against her rape are "false news", saying they "like public opinion", and using her name.
His lawyer has refuted German news outlet Der Spiegel.
Portugal and Juventus characters were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The woman was reportedly $375,000 later on to not tell the story, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
Cristiano Ronaldo, 33, spoke directly to his more than 142 million fans and followers on Instagram hours after the complaint spread, repeatedly claiming it was a "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," the winner of the fifth gold ball says while turning to the photographer.
“They want to be public, and they use my name.
This is normal.
They want to make a name for my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m happy and not very worried,” the player says, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer prepared to accuse Der Spiegel of the false accusation, they called it "an unacceptable and personal suspicion" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherts said he should ask for compensation for "complicating the depth of the incident and its consequences" which is certainly a part of a violation of the rights of a person, the largest of the time."
It was reported that it happened at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player’s room, where he raped her at the bottom, according to a complaint filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga then said Ronaldo kneeled after the incident and told him that he could be a "99 percent" person but was defeated by the "one percent."
The report said Ronaldo agreed that they had sex but were agreed on."
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed not to raise the case because she "was afraid that the case might be back on her" and thought of "his humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman said she would return to the case and that she was still terrified by the incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the charges, and moved to the giant Juve Italy after the 100 million euro deal last summer.
Brexit: UK 'Electors Will Relent' for Car Owners · Global Voices
Britain "will always regret" if he lost his position as a world car producer after his resignation, said Secretary Greg Clark.
Regarding soy, he added, Britain said to the BBC that if he left the European Union with no conditions, production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby, would be temporarily suspended.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker says the delays resulting from Britain’s unconditional exit would result in a lot of work.
The Burnaston production building allows Ausis and Avensis to produce close to 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to member states of the European Union.
“As far as I can see, if Britain is leaving the European Union at the end of March we will see that our production will stop at the end of our revolution,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers for Britain have raised concerns about his resignation from the European Union, without recognizing how trade agreements, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar and Land Rover, will be implemented.
BMW said it would shut down its Oxford factory for a month after Brexit.
What's worrying is what car drivers are saying about the unforeseen occurrence of Brexit-free service.
Toyota's production style is based on "timetime," with a play that arrived every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers only for cars to be imported.
If the United Kingdom leaves an agreement with the European Union on March 29, there would be chaos on the border that could lead to delay and lack of play, people said on this platform.
Toyota will not be able to stay for more than one more day in her production building in Derby, the company's manager says, and production must be suspended.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan to communicate with the European Union is “to install clear signs to prevent border controls.”
"We need to make an agreement to implement the right conditions, not only to experience the present success as I said we can take advantage of this situation and benefit us," he said in a radio show for 4 BBC today.
"Toiota is only proof that we need another producer to continue working hand-in-hand ways that have been so successful since then."
The Toota company cannot say how long the production will take place, but it says that a long-term problem will take place, as the risk of losing the chance of competing with other companies and creating unemployment.
Peter Tsyuvallaris, a 24-year-old employee of Burnaston and a member of the Association at the construction site, said that his members were deeply affected "as soon as I found them, they will not return.
The government's spokesman added: "We should implement a detailed and effective plan for relations with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says "Maison Blanche."
The meeting that would have been very popular for Donald Trump and the interim head of Supreme Court Roseenstein "will be blocked once again" as the battle against Brett Kavanaugh is ongoing by the Supreme Court, said the Maison Blanche Post on Sunday.
Roseinsten closely monitors the work of lawyer Robert Muelle, who studies Russia's interference with Russia's elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's help, and the possibility that the trial is a threat to the president.
In any case, Trump will expel the interim head of the Supreme Court, and Muleller will not be able to leave, according to Washington’s gossip for several months.
Rosenstein said she would speak to Trump and talked about the possibility of losing the president through Article 25 of the New York Times earlier this month.
Roseinstein denied the report.
On Monday, however, he went to Maison Blanche, and another report was reported that he was about to leave.
But there was a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York, as announced on Thursday.
Trump said he prefers not to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting's start was delayed to avoid tensions during the Senate's hearing of Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of being immoral, Dr.Cristine Blasey Ford who both confirmed.
On Friday, Trump investigated the FBI for a week for complaints about Kavanaugh, and postponed your election to the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's pro-Trump secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “The date has not yet been set up, maybe this week, I see all the other things going on in the Supreme Court for the week.
But we will see, I will keep telling the journalists."
Some journalists disagreed with this apology: Sanders had never even gathered journalists at Maison Blanche since September 10.
presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the relief of the press conference wasn't because of a dislike for the "media fire" on TV, but said, "I don't deny the value they have."
He promised to increase the immediate meeting of journalists and Trump.
"The president is holding a meeting with more questions and answers than his predecessors," he added, without proof: "We have examined these figures."
There will be more rallies, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask US President directly, it would be better than talking to me.
We will be doing it as much as possible and you can see that we did it several times in the last weeks and that would replace press conferences so that you can speak to the US president."
Trump always answers questions when he leaves Maison Blanche or when he visits authorities at free assemblys or press conferences.
Talking to journalists is not uncommon.
Perhaps the president of New York has shown this week why he is carefree and curious when journalists gather together.
The Secretary of Health wrote to NHS Scoltand European Union staff about the possibility of Britain's resignation
The Secretary of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union at the NHS in Scotland to express their country's gratitude and wish that they stay behind Britain's resignation.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to go for less than six months until Britain leaves the EU.
It has already agreed to pay for citizens' positions in the European Union working for the Scotland government.
Ms Freeman said in her letter: "In the summer, the agreement between Britain and the European Union over the resignation continued, leading to the decision expected in this autumn.
But the British government is preparing for a possible conflict.
I know you all have a bitter button on this.
That's why I think it's very important for everyone to participate, regardless of where it comes from.
Fellow workers across the European Union and outside the country are sharing experiences and knowledge that are essential to strengthening and improving the health and benefit of patients and organizations we help.
Scotland is totally home to you and we really want you to stay here."
Christon Abercrombie Faces Post-Strol Surgery in His Head · Global Voices
The captain of Tennessee State’s Tiger team had an urgent operation after a head injury on Saturday, he won the Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, according to a report by Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State trainer, told journalists that the wound took place shortly before the first half ended.
"He came to the edge of the stadium and felt flooded there," Reed says.
The coach and health worker gave Abercrombie on the border of the park before he touched himself on a truck and took him back to see.
An official from Tensse State told the WSMV staff in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was released to the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that the operation "is still not known for its injuries" and will try to help Tennessee State when the operation is underway.
Abercrombie is one of the second classes in red, and it's her first time playing at Tennessee State, after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday before the launch of the park, he had a total of five tackles, making it 18 in this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher taxes when they buy land or housing in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher taxes when they raise property in Britain and this will add additional funds to help homeless people in the new Tory plan
The protest will prevent Corbyn's success in his move to attract young voters.
The high taxes raised will be considered by those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The State Financial Fund hopes it will increase to 120 million people annually to help those who are homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher taxes when they grow up in Britain and will add additional money to help the homeless, so Theresa May says today.
The goal was to put forth an effort to prevent Jeremy Corby's success in his process to attract young voters, promising to provide housing for the public and higher salaries.
Everyone and tax companies in Britain will be expected to pay the high tax, plus money to help pressure the government's fight against street sleep.
The current high tax rates, including the highest tax requirements since two years ago, for having two houses and selling rents could reach up to three percent.
The Public Budget hopes it will increase to 120 million £ a year.
thirteen percent of London-based new apartments are estimated to be purchased by non- resident foreigners in the UK, making it expensive and difficult for them to buy one trip.
Many of the country's richest regions in the capital have become "the ghost town" as many foreigners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was implemented, once Boris Johnson made a call for a tax to help young people build their own homes.
She said that land and property became too expensive because big construction firms did not use it, and urged Ms. May to limit the possibility of buying a house to fix Britain's "glorious property problem."
Mr Corbyn commented on several interesting ideas about changes to property, including house controls and the cancellation of "non-existent" evictions.
He also wanted to give authorities more power to be released to create new homes.
Ms. May says: "I said last year that returning Britain's dream would take priority in order for the generation to enjoy a better life.
And that means our problems will be solved in the property market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it would not be possible if it would be as easy as anyone who does not live in Britain, such as a foreign company, to buy a home similar to a British citizen who works hard.
For many people it is only a dream to have a house, and the humiliation caused by street sleep remains to be seen and available."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest wish is to run Scotland'
Jack Ross of Sunderland says his "best desire" is to manage Scotland for the better.
The 42-year-old Scots, 42, is happy and ready to revive the North-East club, currently ranked third in the First League, with three points in the first place.
He moved to the Light Square last summer after he led St Mirren back to the Scotland Head in the last match.
“I want to play for my country like a player.
I've got a B hat and that's it," Ross told the BBC Sound of Scotland.
"I grew up watching Scotland in Sandiden often with my father as a child, and that’s always the thing that brought me back.
If I succeed in managing the club, I will be able to do it."
Ross succeeded in managing the Sunderland: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager said he couldn't keep up with the names for such a large club, if the services from Barnsley and Ipwich Town were rejected.
"My success now is controlled by ‘Can I go back to the club with the First League?'
Because the club’s practices and accountability are certainly owned by the First League," he added.
“It’s not an easy job here, but I think I’ll be successful if I can go back to the club.”
Ross was only three years in charge, after working for a while as an assistant director at the Dumbarton and was one of the enthusiastic trainers there for 15 months.
So, she helped the Alloa get up after she stepped down to third place, and the next time she brought St Mirren back to the winner's championship.
And Ross says he is now more comfortable than ever during his career at Cycle, Hartlepool, Falkikk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It’s certainly one body,” he added, about taking the Alloa.
“I really believed that it was better to run than to play.
It looks strange to hear it but it's OK, I've built up a flag that was in it, and I've tried to have some high profile views.
But playing can be tough.
Every week you visit many things.
I still live in it when I am very concerned and subject to work but the administration goes for granted.
I've always wanted to govern and I'm doing it now, this is how I feel I've been the best in my lifetime."
The entire interview will be heard on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m., UK time.
It's a good time to drink beer on Saturday evening at 5:30, according to a study
The market was not so busy with the sale of alcohol, but now there are people with high temperatures, and the restaurants have become less accessible.
According to the survey, the sales of alcohol shops increased by 2.7 percent in July, but the restaurant decreased by 4.8 percent.
When Peter Martin, a consultant for CGA company, found these figures, he said: "The day was always warm and England took longer part in the Football Championship, and the events of June went on until July, as the alcohol shop increased by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants were not selling the restaurant.
The restaurant received 1.8 percent less in June, and the market became even less active in July.
The sale of alcohol has become so popular and expensive since the restaurant was less expensive.
Traders also sold less of these hotspots, but only profited more than restaurants.
It’s like people just want to get out of it to drink.
Businesses have increased by 6.6 percent during the month's good alcohol shops, and restaurants have declined by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM entertainment and hotel analyst, said: "This thing has been going on since April, and it continues.
Street vendors became expensive because of the weather and sporting events.
It is not surprising, then, that restaurants are always in trouble, and it will be a huge loss because their income has been reduced by 4.8 percent during the year, while prices continue to grow and sell.
Food vendors are losing because of these summer temperatures, but we don't know if climate change has changed things since August."
In total, the profits generated by these alcohol-based shops, including newly opened, increased by 2.7 percent in July, despite the lack of advertising.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales organizer studied the results of 47 countries’ coffee and alcohol sales organizations, and found that the currency was costing £9 billion, which led to the sale of goods.
One child in five has a secret online account that he does not inform his parents
A study revealed that one child in every five – whose age is 11 – has a secret account on the serasara website where he does not inform his parents or his teacher
20,000 high school students were interviewed and many said they had a "secret" page in Insta.
The news says the pornography they share is expected to increase.
Twenty percent of these children said they had an "only" account to inform their parents
1 child out of 5 – who is 11 years old – has a secret online account that they don't inform adults.
20,000 high school students have been interviewed and more children have “hidden accounts on Insta,” that is, on Instagram, where photos can be shared.
The news says the pornography they share is expected to increase.
Twenty percent of the children said they had a "only" account to show their parents, but they also had hidden accounts.
A mother came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, and found young people telling people: "Look at me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and at the Council of Private Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11-year-olds have two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC head of staff, said: "Behind that so many young people want to open secret accounts that their parents and teachers don't know."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the sound of athletes" at Scottish Athletics board
The Scottish Athletics board has been adopted by Eilidh Doyle as director at the annual conference of the organization.
Doyle, the most famous athlete in Scotland, and the President, Ian Beatie, announced that it was done to allow sports organizers to benefit from Doyle's skills and experience in the last decade of international levels.
"Eilidh is very respectful of the sports community in Scotland, England, and around the world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit if he comes into the council," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I am happy to represent the "voices of the athletes," and I hope that I can lead and help improve sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-meter winner of the 1996 Ovalic Games in Atlanta – where he won four of his gold medals – and who frequently comments on sports on the BBC, was unable to go because blood stopped flowing for short periods of time in his brain.
He wrote on Twitter: "I'm bleeding, a month ago.
I can't go.
The doctors said that it was not known whether I would recover or not, but that this will depend on the passing of time and it is not known how.
It was so hard, but now I am completely healed, I am starting again and I can cover a bit!
Thank you for the encouraging message!"
A milk pump advertisement, comparing mothers to cows, sparks discussion online.
An advertising company that compares breastfeeding mothers and cows has sparked online discussion.
Elvie Company released a video of a mother commenting on the use of this tool, when it made its name known: "The first voice in the world is not able to make any sound available."
The lyrics of the song are part of a song where four mothers dance in a haytened calf: "I take milk from me, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't see it well, I can't find it, but I'm breast."
And for the return home is this: "My sister, my mother, I give milk to the baby; my father, my sister, I give milk to these women."
When the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, was launched, however, it sparked a lot of discussion on the Internet.
The video was viewed by 77,000 people, and hundreds of people reacted to it. People reacted to it in different ways, and many said that the video was "bad story" for the dairy industry.
"The idea that the ad was used for cattle has not worked.
These bulls are just like us, they need to get pregnant before there is milk, unless the baby is removed shortly before she gives birth," one commenter said.
The Elvie pump (Elvie/Mother) can be hidden in the souien gorge solut
Another wrote: "It's sure that the mother and child won't get out of the mind and always scare them.
Why not use them for push-up ads for mothers raising their children?"
Another said: "It's a very out-of-the-scenes commercial."
Others reacted positively to the advertisement. One woman, for example, said the song was "good."
“It was a very good idea.
While breastfeeding, I bought an example
I felt like a cow when using taps.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I love it already.
The idea is great,” one person said.
Another wrote: "The ad is designed to make a mother use taps (in the workplace or in the toilet) who feels like "a cow".
The ad is not intended to praise or criticize the company that produces milk products."
At the end of the video, all the women dancing show their tap in a souien.
Many women feel like cattle when using taps. That's the idea behind the advertisement.
The Pamumpy Elvie doesn't make any noise, doesn't need a tube but quickly enters a souien, so a mother can move or hold her baby and walk through the yard when using the tap.
Ana Balarin, who works with the company Mother, commented: "Pompy Elvie is really going to change lives and should be a publicity campaign to make it popular.
We want to show everyone what mothers feel when we compare them to cows in the commercial, and to what everyone sees the difficulties these women face. Because of this ad, people can understand that women are very quiet when they use this tap.
Paompy Elvie is not the first time people are interested in the news.
During the Fashion Week in London, two mothers with children used the device on their way to the famous tailor Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on Texas border
The number of children displaced has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month has not changed. The reason for this is Trump's speeches and his strict policies, which make it harder to receive and care for these children even if someone is willing to take care of them.
In the past, these children were often treated only by undocumented immigrants, who were afraid that they could not stay in the country if they asked to host a child.
The fear has increased since June as federal authorities have announced that adults who host children and other adults should give their own logos, and that it will then be given to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of Immigration and Custom Environment, said in front of the Congress that dozens of people had asked to host children who were affected by the organization.
The organization then said that 70 percent of the people affected had not yet been protected from crime.
"More than 80 percent of the people who ask to host these, or their families, are migrants without legal documents, and many of them are criminals in their home countries.
We're still looking for these people," says Mr Albence.
Organizers are eager to resolve the case of these children and have created a new law that will allow these children to appear in court 30 days after they were finally caught, rather than waiting for 60 days like the previous practice, where people are used to work in their detention camps.
Many are using videos, rather than live-streaming when they should be judged by a judge dedicated to immigrants.
Anyone who is tried and no longer has the right to vote will be promptly returned to his country of origin.
In recent months, people working in the camps with these children have said that children are becoming more fearful and frustrated when they are held for so long, that some become violent and even try to run away.
The lawyers said they received more complaints from larger organizations such as Tornillo. They said, children who are in need of care are at risk.
They also said that if these children are taken to the camp and they are not given enough time to prepare themselves and their hearts when they leave their friends, the pain and fear they already experience will only increase.
American, French, and Turkish soldiers immediately asked Syria to leave its country.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke directly at the UN summit, asking Syrians who had fled to their homes despite the country's eight-year war.
Mr. Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that soldiers camped in the Syrian country without permission, as they claim to fight terrorism, "to mock appropriate punishments."
"Those coming together should leave immediately and no longer depend," he said at the summit.
Mr. Moualem asserted that "the war against terrorism is nearing its end" in Syria, and that more than 33,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to flee.
He also said Damas will "go on to the holy war" to "clean up the Syrian land" for the freedom of the terrorists and the "illegal camp" in their lands.
There are about 2,000 US soldiers in Syria, who are invited to train and counsel the kurdes and the Syrians fighting against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French troops in the war-torn country.
When Mr. Moualem talked about refugees, he said they could return home and blamed "some of the western countries" for "spreading rumors and threatening" the refugees and causing them to stay away from their country.
"We have called on the International Community and human rights organizations to facilitate the return of refugees," he says.
"They are using politics for human beings."
The United States and the European Union said they will not help compensate Syria for the damage if they don't make a deal with Assad to stop the war.
The UN diplomat said that a deal with Russia and Turkey could open a political conversation about setting up a unit between security shields with Idlib.
Russia and Turkey's deal has prevented Syria from attacking the region of three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, asserted that the deal was limited and said he hoped that the army would take over the jihadis personally, in order to "completely empty", including Al-Qaeda attackers linked to Nusra-Front.
The UN diplomat Staffan de Mistura said that he hopes to soon hold the first meeting of the new government and opposition committees to draft a law for Syria to deal with the effects of war and lead to elections.
Moualem has implemented measures on the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, including the need to restrict the judicial action "to review the articles of the current existing law" and to warn against interference in other countries' affairs.
How to be sure Trump will win the second time
Ironically, Trump will only win the 2020 election unless he is caught by the removal or chaos and will leave power in the future as expected by liberal observers.
And without a doubt this would be the "worldly historic end of power!"
At first glance, observers are still tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s annual rating rate has doubled by 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled 1.6 million times.
According to the Nielsen and MSNBC reports, the top and most followed program is 2.4 million people every evening, while more than 1.7 million people over the past four years have watched the program "The Rachel Momow Show" as it is viewed by almost 3.5 million new followers of the night.
“It’s like a hot and appealing fire because it’s something we don’t know at all,” said Neal Baer, ABC’s TV host, of a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack on the government building.

Why? he asks.
"He replied, "Because he made me laugh," writes Ms Scol.

Of course, unlike anything shown on TV, the story from Washington determines the future of Roe v. Wade, whether it is possible for migrant families to meet again or the health of the economy in general.

Personally, I would never think that Super Mario would be the same.
“It’s one of the things that’s felt like his real show, for instance, that he sees something you’re going to have every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars," about Trump’s repeated play show and his secret communication every day (up against N.F.L., complimenting Kim Jong-un).

It is no surprise that the amount of money that works in Pennsylvania's 17th District has increased thanks to cooperation with the district's Congress has allowed it to set up two different candidates for a single location.
The evicted rural district of Pittsburgh prompted Conor Lamb of the Democratic Republic to take place in other districts during the recent elections.
Lamb is currently competing with another power, but the Republic of Keith Rothfus, representing the 12th districts of Pensylvania that are strongly contested by the new 17th district.
The map was restored after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the former districts were illegally distributed to favor the Republic.
The competition for the seventeenth district sparked financial disputes between donors and the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC), and the National Republic Election Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvannia after it won a landslide victory in the 18th Special District of Pennsylvania's Congress in March.
The Republic has always held this position for years and President Donald Trump won the district by 20.
Democrats have been given little benefit by political members.

Trump's meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, he had a hotel in Panama until the Trump administration team joined the trustees.
According to reports from the beginning of this month, representatives from the State Department decided to call on US diplomats to carry out missions from El Slvardor, the Dominican Republic, and Panama to examine "the recent decision to stop accepting Taiwan," and Heather Nauert and women representing the department.
But El Salvador was the only victim of the sanctions, which received up to 140 million US dollars in 2017, including monitoring the use of drugs, development and economic aid.
These sanctions, including cuts to funding and canceling legal visas, will be particularly severe for Central America with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting progressed, authorities in North America and Central America postponed a major conference on peace and economic development to attend such meetings as this last year that appeared to be a step in trying to stop immigrants from entering the United States.
But in September of this year, high-ranking officials showed that they wanted the conference to continue, in particular ending all the punishments that should be applied to El Salvador.
Visy Prezidà Mike Pence, to be held in mid-October, was appointed to lead the conference, the administration held the meeting to determine what was most important.
And three U.S. representatives slowly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, expressing a harsh message about Washington’s sanctions.
Mr Bolton, the spokesman for Maison Blanche, discussed the details of the debate raised by three US officials and agreed to consider internal decisions and the conditions of anonymity.

The Rangers took the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they beat the Austrians, after a similar war in Spain with Villareal in the beginning of this month, they would have the advantage of reaching the G category of the League of Europe.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to authorities, at least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on Friday. This figure would increase.
The connection was completely cut off, so authorities did not know the information from Donggal, in northern Palu. This is the site near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were taken from Palu after the accident.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and vice president, was arrested for violence.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, is suspected of assault at home because he was told the police that he was violent. He also opposed his arrest, according to a Alaska Police report.
Police say a female relative of Palin called the police to report the crime, and Palin threw the phone out of his hand.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su prison, where he was sentenced to a fine of 500 dollars, according to KTUU.
He arrived in court on Saturday, saying "it's very certain that he's not guilty," according to the source.
Palin was charged with three simple crimes, which would lead to one year in prison and a fine of $250 million if convicted.
In addition, he was subjected to a single - day prison sentence, which could cost him $2,000 if convicted.
This is not the first crime against Palin.
He was also accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin, in December 2017.
Sarah Palin, her mother, called the police to report on this.
Alaska's Supreme Court is now investigating the case.
She was convicted of domestic violence in January 2016, according to reports, armed, and drunk.
The woman with her said she had punched her face.
In 2016, veteran soldiers criticized Sarah Palin because they said his violent behavior was related to the military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed · Global Voices
On Friday, at least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that hit Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Electricity and mobile phones were cut off, and the death toll could increase.

A federal prosecutor seeks to be sentenced to death the accused of terrorism in New York.
The federal prosecutor of New York wants Sayfull Saipov to be sentenced to death on charges of terrorism in New York, killing eight people. such punishments were rare in New York, after 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, reportedly used a rental truck to attack people on the bike route, on the Western Road, in the lower Manhattan, while he hit many pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Prosecutors must prove the reason for their demands for the death penalty, that Saipov “spoiled” the killing of eight people, and “impossedly” the death penalty, filed in New York’s Southern District.
All these charges could result in death penalty, according to a court order.
A few weeks after the attack, the assistant judge condemned Saipov in 22 cases, including eight charges of murder through criminal activities (the prosecutor's case of organized crime), violence and car destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack called for "good planning and prior consultations," and explained how Saipov carried out the attack "full of hatred and cruelty and very bad."
" Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov has done harm, assault, and leave a void for Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the complaint filed.
Five of those killed were tourists from Argentina.
The New York South Court has been organizing the latest death penalty case for more than a decade.
Khalid Barnes was then convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty took place in New York City in 1953. Juluis and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed after being convicted of being agents of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, never showed remorse after the days and months after the attack, according to a court report.
He told the police that he was pleased with what he did.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to do the attack, after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for an ISIS flag in his hospital cell.
She said she was not guilty of the 22 charges she was convicted of.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said that they were "deserved" in the prosecutor's decision.
Patton also said: "The case will become longer and more disturbing to all involved, as prosecutors have decided to take the death penalty, but have not only refused to accept the fact that the person confessed to his crime and would be sentenced to life in prison, and could not be released at all.
Saipov’s supporters asked the public prosecutor not to demand death penalty.
Proponents of the European Union say NIGEL FARAGE should not be invited to lead the EU exit agreement
Nigel Farage said in the protest against the EU's suspension talks, he had to ‘call the popular army' today.
The former Ukip leader says politicians should ‘feel the heat’ from those who don’t want to join the European Union. One of Theresa May’s supporters says that she should lead the EU discussions.
conservative Peter Bone said that the British request to Birmingham would have been out of existence now, if Mr. Farage was the secretary of EU resignation.
But it is a serious issue that faces May's reconciliation to its supporters, as some of them have become part of the opposition to the withdrawal from other EU.
The prime minister is struggling to be balanced, as all those who want to leave the European Union and those who want to stay there, and the European Union themselves are attacking him.
His supporters say they should always be in accordance with Brussels, even though they are already in trouble, so those who don't like European groups and labor groups will be forced to choose whether to accept their ideas or find 'disrupt.'
Mr. Bone told the withdrawals during the Solihl campaign, that he likes to 'let the pro-Prime Ministers be arrested.'
He said Mr. Farage should be a friend, and invited to run the Brussels agreement.
He said, 'We would have left the European Union now, if I had been responsible for it.'
Wellingborough supporters also said: 'I will support EU withdrawal, but we should have a bit of sympathy for the supporters.'
He said, against the European Union: 'We didn't have to be punished during World Wars.
We want to if we are the ones who make the law for our land.
Mr. Bone rejected the idea that people might have changed their mind after the 2016 elections, 'It is not true that the British people have changed their mind, and want to stay in the European Union.
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of the European Union, was also at the strike and said, 'This is what I say: Listen to the people, Prime Minister.
'Most people don't like those who don't want change, the Opposition won't vote for it, our party and our protesters don't want it, but they are on the streets, and they will vote for us first.
Don't follow those who don't love reform, but listen first.'
His message to Ms. May was: 'The prime minister is kept in office when he holds his word.'
Mr. Farage told the protesting politicians that they should ‘feel the heat’ if they wanted to reverse the decision in the 2016 referendum.
'When it comes to us – people—and politicians,' he says.
'They want to turn the exit into the European Union, but here we'll tell them 'we won't let you do that.'
He said to the activist crowd: 'I want politicians who want to turn the exit from the European Union if you "feel the heat".
'We call our majority people, because they are the ones who have made us decide to leave the European Union. We will never stop until we become an independent country, have a special leader, and Britain has pride.'
Supporters of the European Union traveled to Birmingham before a two-hour protest took place in the center of the city.
Protesters carried banners to say that they wanted to stay in the European Union.
Mr Adonis, of the Worker's Party, mocked the non-traditionals, as a result of the issue of security on the party's computer program, at the beginning of the interview.
He says: ‘These are the people who tell us that they can install IT software and technology for Canada, for the border war, and for non-border trade for Ireland.’
'This is a farce.
There is no way that it will be released from the European Union, he says.
Warren thinks about ‘examination’ of presidential candidacy
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she "will carefully consider running for president," after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusts' Demokrats talked about the future during their interview at the city hall.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-elected in November to compete with the Republic of Geoff Diehl, who was a Trump campaign manager in Massachusts in 2016.
Many have thought he would compete with Trump in 2020.
His 36th meeting was held on Saturday evening in Homyoke, used in the city's mayoral election, after Trump took power.
One of the attendees asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "for women to go to Washington to fix our morals, so there should be a woman on the head of the regime."
Someone was arrested in the execution shooting in Sims, LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angles, said on Saturday that the suspected shooter was arrested and killed by Leyde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police say Dyonn Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11am. Press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and called on people to tell themselves who the man was on it.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the South University on Friday morning.
" Wayde Sims was injured in the head as a result of his shooting, and died as a result," said Murphy Paul, the police chief, to journalists, in every 247 sports, on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend, and he was the victim of Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, with a gun, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was briefly arrested, and detained in the Baton Rouge Police Force.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, a 1,83m tall, and participated in 32 games, and was one of the top players in the 10 games of this season. He played 17,4 minutes on an average, killed 5,6, and played 2,9 times.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton became world champion, when the judge said he won Sebastian Vettel.
This was clear when Valtteri Bottas got to play before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, so Mercedes's team decided to take a lot of part in the race.
Bottas is slow, and after Hamilton, he defended his position during the first two rounds, and invited Vettel over his friend.
Vettel was the first to stay in construction, and let Hamilton go, but that changed much.
Mercedess were a bit late from the construction, and went after Vettel, but as the Ferrari driver hesitated, he could no longer defend his place, in the third corner.
Max Verstappen is from the end, and seventh at the end of the first round, at the age of 21.
He then took the lead in most of the race, and kept it until the end, crossing Kimi Raikkonen, who became the fourth.
He went to the construction in the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the last eight rounds, leaving him in the fourth place by Raikkonen.
It was difficult because Valtteri struggled during this weekend and left me there, according to that man.
The team was doing very well,” Hamilton says.
This Is a Really Wrong Way
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a demonstration on Saturday, as Feinstein asserted that he did not issue a secret letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who could be appointed as a high-ranking judge, of committing a sexual crime.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s words to the Judge General, but said that some were “wicked and lying”, given what happened in the Senate.
“What happened and was nice in the Senate, when you saw the outrage, when you saw people angry, wicked and lying,” he says.
"When you see what he has published and what secrets he has revealed, he pretends, "I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Did you reveal a secret to Diane Feinstein?
Remember their response...Are you the author of those letters? "Ah, how?"
Not at all.
I didn't do that."
What is good?
Are we leaking secrets... Oh, we did not," he says, about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July, explaining Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh, and published the letter in September, but Feinstein said that the secret was not revealed by his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's words, and I didn't publish his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
“I kept it secret, and that’s what I’ve always done.”
The president said the rejection was absurd, however, in his speech on Saturday night. "It was a very wrong act.
He probably didn’t do it, but his act was the most inappropriate reaction I’ve ever seen.”
The president always defends the prospective high-ranking judge, although three women accuse him of committing sexual crimes against them. The president says the charges are politically manipulated by the Democrats.
"They are ready to support his cause in any way.
You see the wickedness, not their cases where they are injured or violated so that they can gain power and control," according to the president reported by Mediaite.
Great League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer, Giants team, killed twice against the Dundee
Dundee's team defended their honor after the fall of Belfast Giants on Friday, and they won 5-3 in the games back to Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants, through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaufillier, first killed two people.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie hate this, and Dwyer killed the third, leading the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard once again hated the Dundee, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen killed the two who led the victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's team lost this Elite League, but they defeated Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
Four times these teams played this season, and the Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer killed around 3,35 from Kendall Mc Fall, while David F. Rutherford helped Beautillier lead them four minutes later.
Several goals were scored earlier, and Sullivan returned the host to the game at 13.10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt invited him to Crownie at 15.16 minutes.
Dwyer made Giants lead in the first half, as he scored the second goal at the end of the first half of the night.
The host replied again, however, and Bouchard uploaded their number, in 27.37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to make Nielsen die, making Dundee the first in the game, in the second half, with the goal of winning her team with five points, and that's the final divorce.
The Giants have been defeated four times in their five matches, and the next match will be held in their country on Friday, with Milton Keynes.
The Trucker Dies, to Help an Plane Bring Hundreds to a Good Place · Global Voices
The pilot in Indonesia has been praised for being a hero, as he has made it possible for a pilot to carry hundreds of people to live safely.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were still missing, following a massive earthquake in Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The earthquake continues in many places, and many are still plagued by unrest in Palu.
The colleague of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled to save his life, but he refused to leave his tower, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Port, in Palu, although it was shaking violently.
He stopped there to help the Batik Air Flight 6321 pilot, who was already sitting, and the plane was safe.
He then jumped off his tower, after he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, says the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take it to a bigger hospital in other cities.
Sadly, he died that morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“It breaks our hearts,” he says.
Authorities, however, are also worried that the death toll could still be thousands, as rescue workers have blocked the way to Donggala, Sigani, and Boutong.
"This number will increase, as more corpses are still under rubble, but many are still missing," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an emergency spokesman.
A six-meter storm hit Palu, and many were buried together on Sunday.
Army and civilian planes are now reporting relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A ambulance comes every minute, transporting dead bodies.
It is very rare to have clean water.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, president of Indonesia's Red Rouge Internationale, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will see there.
It’s already very dangerous but it can be even worse.”
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Saturday and said to the country's military: "I request everyone of you to work day and night to complete any work related to the release of people in danger.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
By this year's anniversary, Indonesia was rocked by an earthquake that took place in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Drone crash from Micronesia: Air Niugini says a man is missing due to a plane crash in a ocean
The flight airline that crashed in Pacifique airport in Micronesia now claims a missing man, after saying that all 47 passengers and workers survived the plane sank.
The Niugini flight reported in its news that it started on Saturday afternoon that he couldn't explain a man who was a passenger.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline didn't immediately answer questions about the details of the passenger; things like his age or country of origin.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew members when the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday seven people were taken to a hospital.
The flight claimed that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their health was safe.
It remains unclear how the crash and events actually took place.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said they had dropped to the river when they didn't get the pistie.
Some witnesses thought the plane was excessive.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was low.
“It’s really a good thing,” says Jaynes.
Jaynes says he and others managed to get into the water to get out of the water if there were accidents in the plane sank.
He said he was scared and ran away, and he was struck with a small wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy claims that sailors working nearby to improve the port helped save by using a canal boat to bring people to land, before the plane sank to 30 meters (100 pieds) below water.
A Guide from the Safety Safety Network indicates that 111 people died in a plane crash in a PNG flight within twenty years instead of Air Niugini.
The analyst shows a nighttime of burning women alive
The prosecution was able to demonstrate all the evidence on Saturday the second trial of a man convicted of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as a professional witness in the information investigation.
He described how he used mobile phones to describe the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett says he received a lot of mobile phone tips showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the directive showed that his phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford stood in court on Saturday and proved that she was not in the ville that day.
When the preacher asked if Tellis told the truth that he was at the Sanford cafe that night, Sanford said that he was lying, because my camion told him in Nashville."
It is also absurd that Tellis said he knew Chambers at the time of his death about two weeks ago.
What the mobile phone received indicated that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlet says Tellis removed letters, calls, and Chambers' identity from his mobile phone only after Chambers' death.
“They deleted him from his life,” Hale says.
The defendants got the chance to start their final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said he hoped for the fight to go to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop singers want to refute negative views about this species, by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol says hip hop has left its race with political messages and is discussing social issues.
They want to return to their roots and return the conscious hip hop to the people's favors again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen re-appears in ROYAUME-UNIS with permission of artists like Aka and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A child organizer from NEW YORK has filed a complaint against a couple who expelled people after a "racist" note.
A children's organizer from New York is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a wrong note from the mother complaining that "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist and equate the lawsuit with kidnapping."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman who had two children expressed frustration when he found out that the new child organizer Giselle Maurice was black on his first day in 2016.
"FETHER A FURTHER A FURTHER," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
In any case, instead of sending his wife, he sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, the "incompetent" Plasco-Flaxman kicked Ms Maurice out, saying that ex-Americans could not finish their job and he was looking for Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Maurice’s salary was paid for the other day of his work and he was sent home above.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to compensate for his deportation and is looking forward to $350 a day, the first job he received without a contract.
"I want to show them that you are not doing such things," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know that you are racist."
The couple responded to the claim of racistism and said that the end of Maurice's work was the right thing to do, because they were afraid of his innocence after he was injured.
"My husband sent him something he didn't mean."
He is not racist.
In the Post, his wife, Joel Plasco, told the Post, we are not racist.
"But are you putting your children in the hands of people you didn't respect, even if it was a deliberate act?
Your newborn children?
Where."
Plasco, which equates the lawsuit with "kidnapping", said his wife received a child only two months ago and was in "a difficult place".
"Do you see such a person?
It’s not so nice to do that,” said the investment bank official.
While the trial is ongoing, prejudice against the couple on social networks is fast running, hitting them for their behavior and logic.
The editor Paddington was worried that readers would not understand bears speaking, as the new inscription states.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to sit in someone's place when reading it first before publishing it.
It’s exciting to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before I was inspired to write the book to children through a little toy bear, may have been enraged by the denial of his work, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "e-bahona" after his death last year, she added.
Regarding Paddington, who is described as "a very important factor in the family," he added that his father was quietly proud of his latest success.
“He’s a relatively quiet man, and he’s not a self-described person,” he says.
“But because Paddington is real, it’s like you have a child that does something: you’re proud of them even if you don’t.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though this is something he has invented and thought, he has always given Paddington a reputation for it."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctor worked tirelessly to save her life.
"Nad kept calling that it was so bad, saying he didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"After then I got a call from Nad saying he would die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And so I did.
I told him, "Tashi, I love you, I love you.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs she received from her doctor holding her heart to the temple stopped and slowly stopped from her body.
His death was the end of everything earlier.
I just had to sit there waiting, I knew it all happened.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where families and people were.
I had to keep it all.”
At last, Ednan-Laperouse, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, flew with other passengers – forgetting her difficult battle.
“Nobody knows,” he says.
"My head bowed down and tears flowed over the whole time.
It's hard to explain that it was during the flight that I felt this feeling of pity for Nad covering me.
That he needed my love and my ability to stay in his place.
I know he really loves her.”
A sad woman put a document to help prevent suicide by bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put a letter on the Welsh bridge with a message of inspiration and phone number that people can call for help.
Davis's 13-year-old daughter, Tyler, started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want anyone to feel what I feel every day,” she says.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a cheerful cook.
"Everyone knew her smile".
They always said his smile made light of all the rooms."
However, he resigned from his post before his death because he was "in the darkst place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the only one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis says: "I always worried that it would affect."
The letter was created by Davis, “to inform people that there are people there you can go and talk to even if it’s a friend.
Don't sit in a quiet place – you have to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davis for many years, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or that something else,” he says.
"We noticed changes in his behavior two days before Christmas.
He was very bowing down on Christmas day – he didn't look at anyone, anything, when he opened his gifts to children."
He said his death was a huge blow to them but they had to do what they could to get out of it: "It made a hole in the family.
This divided us.
But we must continue our lives and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in danger as the FBI begins the investigation
“I thought if we could get something like what they asked—a limited, limited investigation – we might have been able to bring solidarity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee would “be down” on the way of the supporters.
Why aren't Mr. Kavanaugh and supporters of the Republic happy about the FBI's investigation?
Their dissatisfaction is a matter of time.
The real-time election is just five weeks left, on November 6 - if Republicans fail, they will be paralyzed by trying to get the man they want to be elected to in the highest court of the land.
George W. Bush took the phone to appeal to senators, urging them to support Mr. Kanavanaugh who worked at the House Only for Bush and saw his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI release its report?
There will be elections in the Senate with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to win at least 50 votes in the House of Representatives room, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to beat him and put himself in the Supreme Court.
In North Korea, the number of those who became associated with the opposition has fallen below Kim.
The number of North Koreans displaced to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said one South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, who cites data from the South National Unity Minister, said that there was a transfer of 1127 dissidents last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main reason was the stricter surveillance of the border between North Korea and China and the higher price for smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any personal comments.
Most of the people who moved from the north were eventually given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most fled from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is much easier to cross than the non-military zone (DMZ) between Korea.
China considers immigrants to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often kidnaps them.
The relationship between North and South has been noted to improve - which is still fighting in terms of tekinika – over the past several months.
Earlier this month, two leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the ban on the cease-fire.
It was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when it was generally agreed to work on a Korean unnuclear peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"If there is no confidence in the U.S., our country's security will be uncertain and in this context there is no idea that we will take away our first weapon," said Mr Ri in a speech he gave at the New York Convention of ICT.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "like a bit stupid", saying he cannot work in the Supreme Court
Chief MP Nancy Pelosi called the candidate chosen by the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh a "little fool", saying that he does not want to work in the Supreme Court on his own.
Pelosi made that comment during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think if a woman did this, they said "it's a bit stupid," Pelosi said about his reaction to Karanaugh's testimony to the Senator's court hearing on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he was sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers
In his first words, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes nearly screaming and blackmailed during a three-school conversation about his family and education.
He also openly condemned the Democrats of the committee, calling him a "weird act of murder" that was organized by angry liberals for Hillary Clinton's failure in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed his testimony was proof that Kavanaugh could not work at the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was biased against democracy.
He said: "I think he did not lose himself in those statements, there was also how he persecuted supporters of Clinton and the Democrats".
Pelosi doubted when he was asked if the Democrats were suspicious of Kavanaugh's election if he passed, and if the Democrats got the majority in the National Assembly.
"This is what I will say - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't only want to be in the Supreme Court but also in his current court," Pelosi says.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. Cour d'Appel Fédérale.
Pelosi added that he was worried about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a judge of conservatives.
Listening to the fact that it was confirmed, Kavanaugh fired questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not the time when stupid and biased people go to court and expect us to say, "It's not nice," Pelosi says.
And women need to use it.
It's a big deal, months and years of anger abound and we can't survive without crying.
“We’re crying when we’re angry,” Stineem tells me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, and you?"
She goes on to say: "I was really helped by a Scandre woman who said that she wept when she was angry, but developed a strategy that means that when she got angry and started crying, she told someone she spoke to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And he goes on.
And I thought it was very brilliant.”
Tears can be expressed as a way of expressing anger in part, because people don't understand its roots.
One of the things I remember most when I started working in a man's office, where I once cried out because of the overwhelming rage, the fact that I was greeted by my old man's – always a malicious manager – pulls me off the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," she tells me.
“They don’t know you’re upset.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’ve reached their goal.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his bid for presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a private affair with someone outside of marriage on a ship called Monkey Business, Ms. Schroeder came to mind, in a state of depression, but there was no reason for him not to consider running for the presidency.
“It’s not a wise decision,” she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There have already been seven candidates in the competition, and the last thing they wanted is another candidate.
Someone called it "Blanche Neige and Seven People."
As the campaign has already gone, she is lagging behind in raising money, vowing not to enter the competition if she can't stand $2 million.
It's a failed fight.
She found that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 for men only gave her 250 $.
"Do they think I get discounts?" he wondered.
When he delivered the speech declaring that he would not launch an official campaign, people who supported him - gratitude for the people, frustration with the system that has made money collection and targeted voters more difficult than representatives, and anger over gender discrimination — he has already been choked.
“You might have thought I was in a state of depression,” Ms Schroeder recalls how the journalists reacted to her.
"You may have thought Kleenex was a company that was my secretary
I remember what they will do on my bed?
"He cried?"
How the commercial conflict between DEFITA and China could be a advantage for Beijing
The release of weapons in the trade war between the U.S. and China, and if the war is never over, Beijing may be affected by the gap between these countries in the long run, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, iron and luminium.
The biggest increase this week with a new tax total of $200 billion (150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China into the U.S.
Beijing responds to the death penalty every time, and recently taxed between five and ten percent of US$60 billion on luggage.
China has promised to connect the U.S.-for-shot, and the second largest economy in the world is not expected to shine soon.
Return to Washington means bowing down to the demands, but the worship of CITI in the face of China's president Xi Jinping is in no way wrong.
However, experts say that while Beijing may play well, US pressure on trade is able to support China in a permanent way, by reducing the link between the two economies.
"The fact that political decisions in Washington or Beijing are able to be quickly made to create situations where economic decline begins in one of these countries is even more dangerous than what observers actually agree," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for volunteers to return and call for help to rebuild a country devastated by a seven-year long war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Now, the situation in the country is more peaceful and safer than the progress of the fight against terrorism," he says.
The government continues to recover the destroyed sites of terrorists to restore normalization.
Now there are all the necessary measures for refugees to return to the country they left because of terrorism and the economic conditions that are part of the economic system that are targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The AGIC estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian regime will take relief to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not accept the necessary assistance from countries that supported the uprising.

Italian golf Molinari stared in all his rounds, becoming 1 in 4 to 5-0-0 players because the current game format started in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was fired by the lowest ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark 5&4.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, who was the first player, fell on 2 and 1 of Ian Pouter from the UK who may have played for the last Cup Ryder.
One senior player of the eight Rider Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the most winning player in Europe with 25.5.
"I don't always cry, but today I can't hold back my tears.
That year was hard.
Thank you Thomas for voting and believed me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to get a coupe again.
It's about a team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia says moved after Europe's victory.
He moved the torch to his fellow national brother, John Ram, who banned well-known US golf player Tiger Woods on 2&1 on a single game on Saturday.
"I can't believe the pride I felt over Tiger Woods. I watched that man all the time until I grew up," says Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost in four matches held in France and had a record 13-21-3 of the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of the best players who won 14 readings after Jack Nicklaus alone.
Team USA struggled for a weekend looking for a football stadium apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-level golf during the entire tournament.
American Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing attack, "I am proud of these guys, they are really fighting.
There was a time when we had a bit of a warm welcome for Europe this morning.
We gave up.
Congratulations to Thomas.
It was a Captain.
All 12 players are very good.
We will be united, I will work with the United States Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am happy to work as captain.
You have to salute.
They held us in control.
