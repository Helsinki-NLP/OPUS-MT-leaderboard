Members of the Assembly (AMs) in Wales are concerned that they seem to be stupid
There are amnesty AMs because it is raised to change the way they are referred to as MWPs ( Member of Parliament of Wales).
This has been raised because there are plans to change the name of the convention into the Parliament of Wales.
All political parties are concerned that this is going to happen.
One of his colleagues said his team is concerned that the new name's approach is closer to the way it is called "Twp" and "Pwp."
A student living in Wales: Welsh utwp speaks a fool's mouth, but upp speaks a twat.
According to the National Association of Wales, the organization is not interested in this, and he has suggested other names.
A Conservative member in Wales says his team has no problem with name change, but it has noted that it can be easy to call the MWP how you call a fool.
In this case the spelling of the English-speaking letter is the same as how it is pronounced in English.
The Assembly Commission, who is busy with drafting a law to change the name of the new party, said: "The decision on how to call members of the Assembly will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh convention permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission issued the results of human responses and found that many supported the fact that the convention has changed it as the Palamante of Wales.
In regards to how to call the AMs, the Commission likes this to say that members of Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but the people are in favor of the MWP.
The AMs are said to suggest otherwise, but the fact that it is difficult to agree on this issue must be a problem for Elin Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to make a change in the coming weeks.
This change rule will include other factors that will be changed as the way the convention works, including the rules for stopping AMs and how the committee system is organized.
It is a question of how the AMS will finally be discussed in the question of how they are being called.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether they change their country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia."
This election is designed to address the conflict of decades that runs with a neighboring Greek-speaking country called Macedonia.
The Athenians have long argued that the name of their northern neighbors makes them a claim in their territory, and have long argued against their request to be members of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Jorge Ivanov, who opposed the change of name, has said that he will not withdraw the vote.
However, people who support this election, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this change of name is a price that they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Steels Are Not Wounded as Harding Churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The older people I spoke to say that there was always a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, there is no one."
He said that he knew why the pirates were missing.
He said, "People are having fun in a different way."
"Birth is not a place to live in the neighborhood where people go every day."
You're worried about the church because you think the money you've received from selling its products won't last as long as the leaders think, "and soon they'll come back to their original situation."
He added that churches can be taken into places by people's elevators that will never help in maintaining the remaining local sacred places.
He said: "Many people who buy these shoes are white people, so sooner or later the day the church will be closed, because it doesn't seem like the people who carry them in these shoes are not members of the church.
Both churches were congregations of white people before Harlem became a black community, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist congregation came out in the 1930â€™s.
A black congregation that was holding close to the door of the building.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the picket of merchants at 125th Street, the largest street on which it was purchased in Harlem, opposed to the unemployment and unemployment of black people.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but as Tat' Johnson's parishioners prepared for the rebuilding of it, it was said to be ironed.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Tat' Johnson in St. Martin's, called it the iron beat of "the irony of the people who suffer."
A talented man who had beaten and beaten them, he called it another way: "The treasure of culture" and "a tool of history that we'll never be taken away."
This college, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first time in the world that this metal beat is played by a black music personality, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church with many metals 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not put someone else in his place.
The main thing here in St. Martin's in the last few months was the clash of architects and architects, some of whom were brought to the attention of non-teaching church leaders, some of whom were the Rabe church.
The congregation - a council of trustees, composed of non-teachers - wrote to the president in July concerned that the president should not blame the congregation, although it did not have a hand in the employment of programmers and builders sent by the slum.
Some religious leaders argue that the government does not count things.
A shark injures a 13-year-old baby that sinks into a lobster in California
The police said, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he drowned to catch a lobster in California on the day that he was opened for the year's lobster fishing.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help. They would dive in to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought it was a pleasure to catch the bloster, but later "he realized he was shouting, 'I'm tired!'
"I'm tired!"
"It's all right, it's on the left side of the chest," said Hammel, who noticed that when he came to the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in a state of emergency.
It is not known what type of shark has been infected.
A seaman, Capt. Larry Giles, said when talking to the media, a shark had been seen there over the past weeks, but it was said that it was not a dangerous kind of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the above body.
Officials closed the sea from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours in order to investigate and ensure safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species in the area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to bring its products to the cosmetic market in the UK
Sainsbury's compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams for having cosmetic stores with self-employed people to help people.
As an important way to get into the UK's cosmetic market that makes <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn, continues to grow while fashion and household sales drop, these large cosmetic garages will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country, and will be available for more stores next year to conduct well.
Money investing in cosmetics occurs because these stores want to use empty shelves after being charged with TV, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's will expand its cosmetic products twice to 3,000, including such names as Revlon, Essie, Tweederman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Those already owned by L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have a lot of space to put themselves in places with such names as getting them in stores such as Boots.
The store will also introduce Boutique's cosmetic products so many are ready for people who don't eat meat - something that's really wanted by new customers.
Another thing, the grocery store's best-selling Fragrance Shop will test the needs of two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and the second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, on the way.
Buying online even if people are now buying small meals a day at a nearby store, this is why we need to put large stores to do more in order to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's said, these stores will look like supermarkets with a variety of products, as they try to fight with discounted stores such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and other non-food products.
Sainsbury's set up places to buy Argos from many stores and started with Habitats because they bought them both two years ago. That increased the purchase of food and had to make profits.
The efforts of the former store to improve the cosmetics and medicine departments have fallen down.
Sainsbury's tried to meet the Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke up after fighting in a way to divide the benefits of medicine shops in its stores.
The new plan came after Sainsbury's sale to Celestio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's grocery store is its 281-seat medical price for <0xC2><0xA3>125m, three years ago.
Lloyds also said he will be participating in the show, increasing high-quality cosmetic products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the way the packaging looks with our cosmetics to improve our customers.
We have invested in specialized professionals so that they can advise.
The products we have are designed to fit each requirement, making it a person looking for a place where it is easy to find, now we are an interesting cosmetic place and that's not the same as the traditional shopping method."
Peter Jones' anger 'because Holly Willoughby quits business for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Peter Jones, famous for Dragons Den, goes 'extremely angry' after program driver Holly Willoughby quits a <0xC2><0xA3>11million business on lifestyle production to better deal with his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household products and decorations such as Truly.
The couple's business was associated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop product.
The 37-year-old driver of the motorcycle is on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left fame in the Dragons" Den, Peter Jones who gets angry because she's out of the last minute of the live-action production - to better off her new openings with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was "extremely angry" when an important girl on TV admits to a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her cabinets in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - make it less time to watch the products of luxury goods and luxury goods.
The business is comparable to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop product and has earned twice the amount of Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, at 37, posted on Instagram that he left Truly, Jones had fallen to one of his holiday homes in Britain.
"Truly was the most important thing for Holly," the source said.
It will be his future for a long time over the next ten years.
When we decided to leave, we left everyone concerned.
No one believed what had happened on Tuesday, near the news conference.
"We've got a lot of H<0x51> products ready for sale."
Experts think that the departure of the presenter of the This Morning, amongst those of Britain's largest income, can cost millions of the company because of its strong investment in materials from beams and candles to furniture and things from home, and more delays its establishment.
This can mean the end of long-term friendships.
Willoughby's mother and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly benoCapp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on holiday and Jones has 40 percent shares in Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will be the next host of the M<0x26>S sound and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV program's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not going to talk about his business affairs."
We talked to each other and "love one another"
He is often criticized for finding out about the media about what others consider to be "unsatisfactory" and to speak positively about the North Korean leader.
Why is it that President Trump is trying to get rid of such things?
Trump said in his bold voice "the transmitter in the process I'm in".
"I don't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in reuniting after the first meeting in Singapore in June that had been sent to Trump's hat as a major step towards the end of North Korea.
However, the nuclear war has ended.
More than three months after the June convention in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the National Assembly that North does not see "the same answer" from the United States to North Korea with a warning motion.
Instead, he said that the United States continues its focus on suppressing it.
Trump has given hope to the talk he gave at his party.
"We are doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We fought in North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
Now we're very close."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim and good fruitage - all the trials of the sieges, which resulted in the release of the hostages and the recovery of the bones of American soldiers.
And he has protected her strange way of talking to Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, rather than having 10,000 foreign people trying to get into this full sport we could have about 200 people living here," Trump said with a crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Nyima, destroying the island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, other non-government organizations were told that they were not required.
Even though 10 percent of Lombokâ€™s population were removed from the area, the site was not declared a disaster site, which would lead to the worldâ€™s assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have put it clear that they don't ask for help from the world, so that's a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children gathers a group that will go to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center said that Indonesian officials are investigating the situation of Palu to see if world institutions will be allowed to offer assistance efforts.
Due to the global warming of Indonesia, this country is always not in a shocking way to try the earth.
While hiding the heads of tsunamis in Aceh, they are rare on the other shores.
The absence of an alarm alarm with a tsunami in Palu, even if it has been warned about it, may have contributed to the death of people.
Even in times of distress, tourism between the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel even more difficult.
The ship in the hospital is stationed in Lombok to deliver the victims of an earthquake to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widododo put forward an initiative to improve the infrastructure of Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure when he stepped down the support of elections, and he has spent much money on repairing roads and railway stations.
But the lack of funding has hit Mr. Joko's government as it will be re-elected next year.
However, Mr. Joko is facing stress in Indonesiaâ€™s apartheid conflict, where a large number of Muslim members have entered the main focus of this service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets using mules, spears, and shields, as well as other dangerous weapons.

Police arrested a 32-year-old man on charges of murder after a woman was shot dead
A murder investigation began after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.

The police have called the locals who have seen or heard anything if they have ever come before.
Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still starting but I urge anyone in John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything that claims the punishment to contact us.
I also like to urge anyone, especially tax collectors, who may call anything by dashcam to contact us as possible with the most important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that a woman who found her body in Birkenhead has been found in the middle of the property.
Friends who think they know the woman who had come to this desolate place and ask questions about the place in which she was found this morning.
The investigation continues as the police have attempted to inform the close relatives of the victim.
A taxi living in Grayson Mews recently tried to return to his elevator but was told by the police that no one was allowed to go out of the building.
He was shocked to hear what happened.
Now the locals have been told that they will be allowed after several hours to return to the interior.

Cromwell's painting was the last to be discovered by the controversy that would be 'rewriting history'
Their removal would be justified in the face of his revolt similar to the Taliban in the vast majority of British traditional and religious images conducted by his zealous Puritan followers.
Cromwell, however, described Mr. Crick's advice as "a fool" "to try to write history anew."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the debate was there with the removal of images that had been drawn to the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster to be a victim.
The destruction of images in the English wars was neither directed nor performed by Cromwell.
Cromwell who married will probably be given to him because of the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent description of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century views and part of the history of many who still think that his life must be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps largely by the late 19th century even more than now, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, mostly in his case of pressure from the military.
Whether this method of description is completely accurate depends on the ongoing historical debate.
Sure enough, the conflict that existed in the middle of the 17th century has influenced the development of our next country, and Cromwellâ€™s being a youth who has represented one side of that conflict.
They will be called the Lord of glory and honor."
The Deadly Pig Kills a Chinese Blindman Killed
The farmer has been attacked by pigs in a market in the south west of China, according to local news reports.
The man, described only as his "Yuan," has been found dead with a broken bone, covered with blood near and then pigs in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject his pigs into the hamburgers on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining Province, <0x51>inghai, China.
He is said to have been traveling with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 sheep in the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found out that the door to the nearby pigs was opened.
He said there was a large herd of pigs with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that the powder weighs 550 marks and injured the mother, according to a report.
"The legs were blood and skinned," said the baby named "Wu," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuan entering the park at 4.40 am on Thursday feeding the pigs.
Her body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig killed Yuan, not his own, or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked so that it didn't attack other people, while the police collected evidence in the area of the crash.
Yuan's family and authority in the market are said to talk about compensation for his death.
Although rare, the situation in which the pigs have been recorded when they attack people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man was injured in a hoax.
Over the past ten years, a 650-strong pig caught a Welsh farmer in the trekthari until his wife drove the pig away.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told the CBC News that the pigs felt uncomfortable but their blood flow could cause them to be.
They're just playing games.
They're extremely protective...they don't have any purpose to harm them.
"You have to give them the right amount," he said.
The Hurricane Rosa flags bring to the attention of the entire area of heavy rain to the south-west of the U.S.
As the weather forecasts show, Herican Rosa fails as she drifted over the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south west of the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has 85 mph (85 km<0x2F>h), Cathegori 1 Hurricane, from 5 a.m. in the Western period on Sunday, and was located 385 miles (85 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go to the west on Sunday.
At present, the trough begins to take shape in the Pacific Ocean and travels east along the western U.S. Coast as Rosa comes to California peninsula on Monday as a tropical cyclone will begin to blow up the tropical wetlands to the north-west of the US.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in Mexico's areas on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the coming of the trough will create a milder rainfall in the south-west over the coming days.
According to the home, one inch - 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous erosion, the movement of fregmentites and the desert landslides.
By placing at home the deep tropical humidity will cause the rate of precipitation will be from 2 to 3 inches per hour on the posts, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Although it is expected 2 to 4 inches of rain in parts of the South West, especially on the side of Arizona.
The flow of flowing water occurs very quickly in the conditions of the dying tropical dry climate.
It will not be a very good idea to try to walk the mountains in the wilderness with the fear of tropical rainstorms.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become strong rivers and thunderstorms will bring destructive winds to the community and there will be dust.
Its coming will bring some major rainfall to the community in some parts of the Southern California coast.
The total rainfall that will occur will be more than half an inch, which can result in smaller water flow frames and cause them to flow along the way.
This rain will be the first rain in this region to occur in the aquarium.
Another short-term tropical rainfall will first occur in Arizona on Monday evening, before the rains are everywhere on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Rainfall will take place in the fourth quarter on Tuesday and will be abandoned on Wednesday.
In October we can see some concern in the warm environment in the U.S. as the Arctic can get cool, but the tropics are still hot.
This sometimes affects the changes in temperature over a short distance.
There is a good example of the hottest bands in the U.S. center on Sunday.
There are nearly 20 different temperatures between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Monies, Iowa.
In the past few days, the heat of the summer is trying to build and expand.
The size of the center and east of the U.S. is expected to see a warm start in October with a gap of 80 from the South to the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which can result in an estimated 10 degrees more than normal size.
Our forecasts for long-term space weather show high temperatures above the middle east of the U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Kavanaugh Brett's counsel.
More than 20 million people have watched evidence of the rape of the fourth body by Supreme Court's choice of Brett Kavanaugh and a female accused of sexually abusing it during the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political climate continues, with a dissemination that disrupts the design of Friday's regular procedure to change in the last minute: a contract by Arizona Sen Jeff Flake so that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the trial.
Ford told the Senate Administration Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh put him under the influence of alcohol and attempted to release him from high school.
Kavanaugh, on the evidence of the body, said it was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is common for more than 20.4 million people to watch Nelsonâ€™s report on Friday.
The company counted the number of followers on CBS, NBC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers have not been available at this moment to appear on other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
As a result, the company has a number of people who have been in the office.
To put it in this situation, it is the size of the sidelines and when it comes to the finals and points on the football club or in the course of education.
The Fox News Network, in its view that there is a program that supports Kavanaugh's strong electoral system, has led all other networks by having an audience of 5.69 million followers at a time of counsel throughout the day," said Nielsen.
ABC was ranked second by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had four 3.1 million, NBC had 2.294 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million," said Nielsen.
The interest has left behind after the counsel.
Flake is the best person to be seen in a movie.
After the Central Office of the Republic issued a statement that he would be voting for Kavanaugh, he was found by CNN and CBS Cameras on the morning of Friday by protestors as he was attempting to ride the fission to the direction of the Executive Committee.
She stood up for a few minutes as she was critical, speaking at the moment on CNN's TV.
"I stand in front of you," said the man.
"Do you think you're telling the truth?
He was told, "You're strong while most women aren't strong".
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, there was much to say to the counsel committee.
The broadcast and cable networks all broadcast at the moment in the following hours, while the Executive Committee would vote to advance the election of Kavanaugh on the full electoral network.
But Flake said he would only do so in line with the FBI where he would not look at the charges against the election next week, in which the Democrats are just a few of the parties that were advised there.
Flake suggested that by speaking to his friend, the Democrat Chris Coos.
After talking to Coons and other Senators then, Flake decided to make a decision.
Flake's choice is strong, as there is evidence that Republicans do not vote to accept Kavanauh unless it is investigated.
President Trump has filed a FBI investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
Britain's PM May alleges ways to be more "political" than Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May alleges plans to leave the European Union "politically playing" with Britain's future and to underestimate the interest of the country in what it says in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.

The fighting broke out late in the afternoon when the police used their rods to stop fighting.
After some hours pro-independence groups have made habits "There is no forget, no forgiveness" that they have directly confronted the unionista protestors who have scuttled, "Long life in Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatments for a small number of injuries received in protest, reporting a local paper.
The pursuit of fear remains the same at the highest level in the Independent region, after the April 1st of October it was illegally started by the people of Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan protesters.
The voters often chose to be on the side of the Independent, although it has been found that it was a low standard for those who did not comply with the withdrawal of a higher electoral measure.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote that was taking place in the electoral stations throughout the region with themes of clashes.
The pro-independence groups have complained on Friday night to stop protesting by supporting the country's police.
Protesters have continued but have been forced to do so by other means.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who has engaged in racial and cultural protests and his wife has no hope that the Catalans can gain their freedom.
"This last year we had a great experience with others.
"I watched my parents cry tears of joy because they were even able to vote but now we can't continue," he said.
Despite being able to control the sparse victory in the district elections in December of last year, Catalan pro-independence groups have been struggling to keep the situation in place this year because their best-known leaders keep them in custody by either their own or under police maintenance pending a judicial review of the scandals due to the regrets of the scandal.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old cabinet member who recorded a protest in support of the police on her phone, said the conflict was politically motivated on both sides.
"There's been a lot more fear."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the previous trial at the end of last year, announced that he will take part in the next year's European Parliament election.
"If representing elections in the European elections it is the best way to criticize making the latest free moral code and the regime we've seen from the Spanish government," he said.

BBC Scotland at Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Playing with amazing quality and the effects of Livingstone.
For a man. They were outstanding, they continued to focus on all that was expected in this way.
Their style of play and control has never changed the way they have returned with a standard plane, but fame is given to Holt in such a way that you do not smile at the team's game as it has come to.
He had many heroes.
The team leader Halkett had a personal, which organizes a small-scale defensi, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral enjoying each time.
The Rangers need some encouragement.
Although they played very well at times under Gerrad, they have fallen short of these standards.
Their last ball was a failure - only in which they won the home Open title - and that was a blow to the Rangers, which they found at the center of the table.
Erdogen has received mixed reception in Cologne.
It was full of smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September as leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered in Berlin find breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's inaugural visit to Germany - and aims to resolve the relationship between NATO alliances.

Erdogan then goes to Cologne, which opens a very large queue.

Police have stated security reasons to prevent 25,000 powerful people from meeting before the Mosque, but many of the supporters have said it is close enough to see their president.
Hundreds did not accompany the Erdogan protestors - most of them are Kurdish- and make their voices sound, destroying the operation of the police and the decisions of the German government so that the national government could accept them.

In some parts of the Southwestern Desert including the center of the Rockies and Great Basin it is possible to get 1 to 2 inches, and the distances alone up to 4 inches if possible.
At these risk of flooding, Rosa's rainfall is no surprise as the area is affected by droughts.

At least 384 people have been killed, many have been shot dead away by huge waves lying on the sea, where a large earthquake and tsunami have hit the Indonesian island in Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered at the Palu beach on Friday in which waves up to six feet (18 feet) hit the dry ground, which destroyed people because they killed many people and destroyed everything on their way.

"While the tsunami promises to emerge yesterday, the people were doing their duties at sea and never run away from them immediately and ended up being victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroo, spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Defence BNPB said the statement when he gave comments in Jakarta.
"Tsunami has not gone alone, drove cars, blocks, houses, draws everything from the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami is traveling by open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before it reaches the beach.
Some people walk on the trees because they try to avoid the tsunami and wait for it," he said.
About 6,700 people have been evacuated from their homes to 24 homes in Palu.
The Aerial photographer was released by the emergency services agency who showed many buildings and shops destroyed by tsunamis, bridges that connect to some of the fallen and mosque covered with water.
Tsunami fruit has continued to move on the coast of the city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes cover an area of 2.4 million people.

The U.S. is backing up the A.I. budget.
China has become more active in the Non-Fiction, the U.S. needs to spend more time in the research sector, says financial supporter and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These accounts come after various U.S. government agencies have made AI declarations, as well as the U.S. that fail in all AI's legal procedures.
Currently, China announced its plan last year : it was intended to be No.1 in the AI design by 2030.
"The repetition of the AI research budget will be a good start, as all other countries are behind the U.S., and we look at the next AI design," Lee said.
Recommendations can repeat the chances of the next major AI success that will take place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "Great Powers in AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, which financed one of the largest AI companies in China, Face<0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI program that struck the most senior Othello player of the United States, who was later the head of Microsoft Research, and was the president of Google at the Chinese branch.
Lee accepted the previous competition of U.S. government technology as a Robotic Challenge for Projects by the Central Security Research Agency and asked when it will be next, in order to identify the following concepts.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to win government funding," Lee said.
"It's not China that adopts education leaders; it's united bodies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have attracted people with knowledge from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change in foreign policy can help support its AI efforts.
"I think the green card will automatically be given to those who make PhD's in AI," he said.
The National Council of China issued its Plan for the Promotion of Non-Fiction in the Subcommittee on Subcommittee in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to students in educational institutions who have been united in the way they do the Foundation for Natural Sciences as well as other government institutions offering funding to U.S. researchers, but it has become the lowest level of education in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Center for Non-Proliferation, which was designed to include co-operative groups from production to education, and the White House has announced the establishment of the Non-discriminatory Intelligence Committee.
And this month the DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment as the starting point for a trial called AI in the near future.
As the NSF, it now has more than <0x24>100 million in annual savings and is prepared for research in AI.
Currently, the U.S. legislation has set out to create a National Security Assistance Commission on Non-Presidential Intelligence has not yet been started in the months.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum to change the name of their country.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday that changed the country's name to "the Republic of the North of Macedonia," a move that resolved a ten-year-old dispute with a block of members to call prices to the European Union and NATO.
The Greenpeace, which has a province called Macedonia, requires that its neighbour in the North represent a claim in its place and end the entrance into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed a treaty in June based on the application of a new name, but the Nationalists' opponents objected to the change of the name saying it undermines the origin and culture of the majority of the Macedonian nation's Slavonic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote for a referendum and the campaign who refused to cooperate is not sure that people who would vote would meet the requirements to collect at least 50<0x25> necessary for achieving an open vote for re-election.
The question in the liberal electoral register reads: "You may be a member of NATO and the EU who accepts a treaty with Greece."
Supporters of the exchange of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price paid is worth it to make an admission to boards such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, which are some of the countries that will meet the Yugoslavian border.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, making new people here in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that will mean a safe life for all of us," said Oliviera Georgije, who is 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, the members of parliament have stated that they will comply with the results of the vote so that they will not be held eligible.[2]
The change in name will require a second majority of the third party in the parliament.
The country's electoral commission said that there were no unusual reports at 1 p.m.
However, the existing population stood at 16<0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the 2016 parliamentary election in which they were 66<0x25> voters.
"I'm here to vote for my children, our place is in Eurpe," said Josie Tanevski, 62, with a vote in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for a change of name in Macedonia that would open a way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, repaired a small platform and tossed it in front of the chairs set up by those who disagreed with the referee.
"We can be NATO with the EU, but we want to join with determination, not according to the services at the door," Kavadarkov said.
"We're a poor country, but we're very talented.
"If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert countries such as China and Russia into part of the Euro-Asia alliance."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the investments that are most needed in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will love it because they're more than 80<0x25> of citizens who love Nato and the EU," Zaeve said after voting in the text.
He said that "yes" would be the result of "resolving our future."
A list of voters will be published on the last Monday by the Macedonian Political Center for Research which is represented between 30<0x25> and 43<0x25> of the voters who will participate in the referendum - below is the number needed for the vote to be successful.
Another electoral list, held by Telma TV of Macedonia, has been found that 57<0x25> of people are planning to vote on Sunday.
In the month, about 70 percent said they will vote for you "yes" . . . . said the same thing about you.
In order for the election to be successful, it is necessary to vote for 50<0x25> and one person more.
The failure of the Referendum will bring the first powerful blow to the pro-Western government's policy to postpone its takeover of cables in May last year.

Democrats, he said, are on the commissions that are on a mission to "controversial and disruptive."
"And you've seen what happened in the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "to be angry about being dishonest and unkind and truthful."
He refers to the Senate Administration Committee on the level of Democrat Sean Dianne Feinstein's name, where he has received calls from viewers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you sent a letter to the doctor?
Uh, uh, what's it?
No, no, I'm looking forward to the other â€“ it's a bad thing to say about the body - talking about the bad body in the worst way I've ever seen."
Labyrinth is no longer an alcoholic.
Don't hesitate to talk about those who think you
While the members of the House of Representatives voted against me, it would be a shame to me.
After all, I'm the main one on the list of Labour MPs to be told about the lack of all they're talking about.
Joan Ryan, a member of the parliament, has received a positive response from me, and she has stood up in confidence against the Jews.
In my case, my criticisms and criticisms are incompatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
In an important policy of the effective economic system, the national security, Europe, by regulating the common issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report at the Nottingham East Labour Conference wrote that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and effective."
For nearly every eight years I am an MP for the local community, GC meetings on Friday night have always been the same.
That's where it's bad today, this modern meeting isn't a ton of meetings that often have "personal and soft, low tea" politics that run away from scratch, however, they can start again.
There seems to be a growing variety of views of the diversity are not accepted in theLabour group and all views are reviewed before being accepted into the care group.
This began after Jeremy's entry into the chair of leadership, such as his colleague and I had been thinking of sharing with him with the view his political partner and I was expected to turn it fast and take places I didn't agree that I would agree with them - rather than the national security or advertising and that one of the U.S.
Whenever I speak out--and that's not my concern- has followed the censorship of social media sites that are said to have been thrown into the chair, it's not accepted by the local politics, I'm told that I'm not enough to be in the Labour Party.
That's my experience.
As a result, I know that I am more fortunate than others who work with me as the committees are brought to me directly to be politically motivated.
I respect the art and determination of people who work with me who are struggling to endure sexual or racial discrimination every day but can't push away from them.
One of the most challenging aspects of politics is the way in which the levels of appeal are still popular.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor Party had taken over this tradition of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer your big one and in a state of "hopeless" or changing the rules of the group that have been stigmatized.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years asking me to give up, not to talk about how I speak and then "it's all right."
But that's not what I'm doing in politics.
What I said was to join Labour for 32 years as a school child, the raising of the Thaicher government does not care about not to ignore the room in which I have left it to the ground, since then I vowed to fight for the best services of the community and those who need it, even if I were a counselor or a minister.
I've never been able to hide my political involvement, including this past election.
No one in the East of Nottingham can be confused by any way about where I stand in my police, and in places where I disagree with the leaders that are currently in.
In those cases that have been raised now on Friday, in all I can say while Brexit is causing harm to our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand his desire to spend my time and energy on my dedication to the leader of the Labour Party.
The only thing to note is that one message I have will not be in Nottingham Momentum, will be for my people, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud of working under you and I promise that there is no price left to be given or political assistance can stop me from doing what I believe is your most important needs for you and all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes ahead.
Two of the later triaries are focused on the finals almost leading to the results, but there is no doubt that Ayr should deserve this such excellent victory for the celebration of the Tennent's Premiership Day game.
Now they increase the rate, the main one can be divided.
In the end, it was their high-quality defense, as well as their opportunity to take a better chance, which resulted in a domestic side satisfaction with coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we haven't been beaten yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks Ayr, they did better than we did."
Grant Anderson on his try was in 14 minutes, replaced by Frazier Climi, who put Ayr before, but, the yellow card of the Scottish cap Rory Hughes, was copied from the game by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the Penguins swirling and squeezing them.
Ayr's leadership, before, during the second half of the game, posted an article after which he changed the solo try making 17-5 to Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's tyre, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the chances of five points.
It has been said to be a long time ago due to the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, who has been released with a new stretch, and when the Ayr was restarted it has quickly risen with the Stafford McDowall Trail, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's leading captain Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and again, Melrose has charged a man with an untranslated street by Bruce Colvine, under strong pressure.
However, it is returned home and when Struan Hutchinson is given a yellow card because of Climo's goalless ball without the penal line, MacPherson has gone to sleep behind as Ayr is considered.
Climo has changed, as almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's balls from the box and sent Gregor Henry away by putting the fifth.
The game's styling seems to be ready for a new work in an hourly field.
Still Game Manager Ford Kieran appears determined in the reception section after it was discovered that he has been placed as a licensed company manager.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, writing with fellow comic star Greg Hemphill.
The two have already stated that the upcoming ninth series will be the last of the show's run and it seems that Kiernan is preparing to do something else after Craiglang.
According to a list of traditional reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player has not wanted to comment on this article, although the source of the Scottish Sun has said that Kiernan wants to enter "a well-developed hourly enterprise" in Glasgow.
"Our Sea": Bolivia is bound to the earth in hopes that the road will open its way to the Pacific
The mahogany is the capital of the city of La Paz.
Public buildings are designed to cover the blue flag.
The naval formations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are striking all of the words: "Our sea is legally.
"We've got our work again."
Throughout Bolivia confined to the earth, the memories of the sea coast taken by Chile in the war on the treasure war that had a huge flood of bloodshed in the 19th century are still becoming more conscious - just as it is with the desire to retreat to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes arise in the best way in the centuries, as Bolivia awaits the sentencing of the world's legal court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia is strong, spirit of unity and calm, and they are waiting with a good spirit for the results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will listen to the verdict of the World Court of Justice in the largest screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand in the Bolivian claim that - after decades of prolonged negotiations again - Chile is forced to consider by giving Bolivia an unseaworthy place.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's living and co-existing president - who faces a massive re-election fight next year - also has much to do with this Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said in late August.
But some analysts feel that it is unlikely that a court ruling on Bolivia's side - there is nothing that will change so much.
The United Nations Working Group in the Netherlands has the power to remove Chilean soil, and has said that he cannot know the consequences of possible talks.
The fact that the verdict of the World Court of Justice came out only six months after the debate indicates that the case was "unprecedented," Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of helping with Boliviaâ€™s desires, four years may have brought it back.
"The issue of sea access has been crushed by the existing Bolivian government," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' words have concluded any kind of kindness in Chile," he said.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not been in a state of emergency since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, is proud of what the court has decided very quickly in an unusual way.
On Monday he will give Bolivia a "special opportunity to reveal on a new page of cooperation with Chile" and the opportunity to "destroy 139 years of conflict has been proven to be beneficial," he said.
Calzadilla also seals the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses the sea as a political suffrage.
"Bolivia won't just give up its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This is an opportunity to see if we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not abandon nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States.
The North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not be separated from its nuclear weapons first if he does not trust Washington.
Ri said on Saturday at the United Nations National Assembly.
He asked the United States to follow the promises made during a conference in Singapore among the leaders who are facing eye movements.
He speaks of these words when President Mike Pompeo appears to have re-established a nuclear-launched negotiations more than three months after that in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
RI says it is "too complicated" that its ongoing and declining U.S. resolution to end the Korean War will result in North surrendering.
Washington agreed to accept this agreement before Pyongyang began to take steps to break the arms.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump need a second term.
But many people doubt that Pyongyang is willing to sacrifice the weapons considered by the country as the only way to ensure that it is safe.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim and Trump's meeting.
The Paris Fashion Show features a variety of recent scenes you'll see on the streets of the city near you.
If you want to increase the skin you have or want to burn the sun so don't go anywhere else.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne have begun to make a series of very unusual superheroes for the SSR19 show which has rested next to the floor set on the Paris Fashion Week.
These alarming masks have been streaming on Instagram this summer and these have been sending their shocks to the show.
Valentine's Day's only hat is the wide-ranging beard covering the entire head of the costume designer.
One of the biggest hats included tearful guitars, a wig hat even a pane - but it is not designed to heat your head.
Thomas Browne also came up with a series of shock masks at the time of Nohepen.
Most of these masks are colorful with woven lips and are similar to Hannibal Lecter than the styles they are not.
One of the hats was like getting into the water with something to breathe and thirst while the other resembles an ice cream stove.
And if you're interested in fashion, you're lucky.
People who are struggling with the slums say that these slums may also be moving to your home.
These are the most prominent figures in the shape of La Bomba', a two-foot-long lantern worn by people such as Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The flag that made these strange hats filled with social media websites has come with another big thing that was shown - a grass bag carried on the beach almost as large as a viewer of the clothes wearing the swimwear you carry.
The raffia hip-hop, with white hat edges on top of the white hat, was the lead in the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage's famous architect told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags reach people in the next summer - as designers have come to our senses it's going to be hard not to miss people who're going to get these big things out of the way."
John Edward: Language skills that are important to people of the world
Scottish independent schools have a high reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with other results of an unprecedented test, which is encouraged by each person by the success of the sports team, art, music, and other public events.
As it has more than 300,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer high quality service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students when they go to higher education, free education, and their place as people living in the world.
As an educational sector that can design and install a school curriculum that deserves conditions, we see existing languages continue as a popular and essential schooling course.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, he reaches his mind.
"If you speak to him in his language, you'll be able to reach out to him."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't trust in English to build relationships and trust with foreigners.
From the latest results of the exam, we can see that the languages are high on the tab with a high degree of admission to independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-language students have received a grade A score.
The collected information, in 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72 percent of students have received a High School A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of whom are French and 63 percent of Spanish students have received A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills for children and young people who are confident in the future.
Now languages, such as the preferred course, are equally appreciated as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and others.
The UK Commission's research for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for employers' reasons for having the problem of filling posts at work, 17 percent is associated with the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more, language skills become necessary to prepare young people for the tasks they will do in the future.
As more workspaces require languages, these skills are essential in a collaborative world.
Whatever a person chooses to work, if you learn another language, you will have more opportunity in the future to have a lasting talent like that.
The ability to communicate directly with people of other countries has made it possible for a person who is familiar with many languages.
According to YouGovâ€™s study of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to communicate and only French with more than 15 percent.
That's why investing in the language is now essential for the children of today.
Learning a lot of languages, especially those in developing countries, will empower children with the best opportunities to get a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages we teach.
Several schools will pay attention to the current languages of the past, while others will teach languages that are thought to be very important in the UK when viewed in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there will always be a number of different languages to choose from in private schools, there are also teachers who are comfortable with this section.
Scottish independent schools are committed to preparing for a teaching environment that will prepare children to equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, no matter where they go in the future.
It cannot be argued now, in the world's business world, that languages continue to be important in the future of the country, so this should be evident in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as "the ability to communicate with the world."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, to break and relax for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bienaire.
John Edward is the Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools

"You'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that it is likely that James played a limited amount of minutes.
After a week's training, James was named in his plans for the Lakers soap opera.
"I don't want to play at this stage of my career to be good," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his controversial evenings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of the five planned conventions this week including a visit to friendly places that also include Tennessee and Mississippi.
As a confirmation vote has been suspended until his election to the Supreme Court, Trump's attempt to dissolve the support of the second election since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it comes to vote on Nov.
When will Trump's convention be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's convention in Wheeling, West Virginia is set at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's convention in West Virginia on the internet via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak at a meeting this week for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, in a difficult situation due to allegations of sexual misconduct that he is expected to be suspended for a week's confirmation vote while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this meeting is to help Republicans to cope with the November election.
As a result, President Trump's campaign said these five meetings will be aimed at "integration of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase their numbers in the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The presidency of Congress is so important to him that the president will go to as many countries as we approach the busy vote-making crisis," Trump's voting spokesman who did not want him to be known to tell him what Reuters did.
Founded in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this present-day exhibition can still shake support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and have been known to Pittsburgh by their local news," the West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be Trump's second time to visit West Virginia, the state sector won by a margin of 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who goes after the election.
"It's not Morrisey's good sign that the president is forced to support him," said Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that when you're riding for success you're still struggling as one of those looking forward to the individual's games with Sonto.
After three games a person plays on his own, playing as a starter for four is the most sought after by the Ryder Cup.
The position of forward in any team has made the idea of sports players who really believe in it, and it's a competition like that.
So, who's going to be the leader at this time?
"They've paid them for six points and now they're relatives, so I think they're going ahead," said Jordan Spieth, while walking far enough.
Europe has taken advantage of this opportunity, in fact, it has four more points and another 12 not yet confirmed.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel like it's going well and there's a lot of interest there, including how Spieth and Justin played well all day and the couple have three-and-a-half points.
Spieth has always been playing well since the start and leads for example.
When people were very angry about the joys of his sport, he put the ball in a crucial time to win the match after he and Thomas were beaten by two points.
To blow a ball into a hole that made them win the game when they arrived at 15 made people apologize in the same way, in a way that tells you that the U.S. team is not defeated.
"You have to worry about your game at all," said Spieth.
They have abandoned it.
18 holes to mark it.
Players with points over Spieth and Thomas in the past two days by Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup
Europe's ways make it unusual for couples and can't do anything wrong.
"The second so-called "Moliwood" is the roughest bogey on Saturday and Saturday mornings, with Friday afternoons and Back Nine on Friday mornings.
This partnership, along with their interest, appears beautiful in the crowd as the players allowed to win the church, and there is no other famous player who won the European Championship when the sun reaches the Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood and Molinari.
It's best to play at the same time in different places.
Europe's success is not clear, but
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia's work as a young, four-star recruiter in the morning, when he got a partnership with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the other two points went by a pair of four fronts with a Spanish hole and a Swiss that they couldn't get out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Four balls and four players enjoy watching around because of the cooperation of the combined people, the advice they offer, the advice they don't compete with and how the program changes in just a short time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and leads up to the final day but four players have shown that the American team is holding a non-resident deficit if possible, especially the Statise.
Europe leads 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will lead well into the final round of the Ryder Cup after four appearances and four games for the four players to make them their own by 10-6 in the United States.
It is given the interest of the couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary who changed the game to defeat the distressed Tiger Woods to advance to the National Golf Championship by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, wanting to win a tie that separates Hazeltine from the previous two seasons, the U.S. side of the morning with four points, a consecutive game-winning victory in 3-1.
The U.S. did not easily concede four games, winning two games, even though they did not qualify for the tournament.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points in 12 individual sports to get the title
Fleetwood is the first European to score four points in a fresh match with Molinari, they were called "Molliwood" after the weekend the first two weeks to win four points when the Ryder Cup opened.
With Woods and Patrick Reed on four balls, they went on to win Woodsn and fellow American reader Brysin Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled in two games on Saturday, showed where he was interested but only picked up the 19th in 29 games that he played in four leagues with four players and four sets in a row.
Justin Rose was relieved in the morning of the tournaments and his teammate Henrik Stenson came back in the 21st and 1st pick Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's leading scorer
Europe was not easily conquered in France.
Jordan Spieth's father three times and Justin Thomas did the best thing for the Americans to score two points on Saturday.
They gained the win by 2 and 1 when they played with Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of these forebals they split Paulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 of these Foursomes divided into two opening rounds.
Two times the Ryder Cup team returns to the division with four points going to individual matches, although Furyk's side needs to play in the semi-finals.
After two days, the attack on the Sunday was protected.
North Korea says it will "never" complete its weapons before it gets security.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that these judgments made it unreliable between the United States and there was no way that the United States could complete its Nuclear Weapons when it received security guarantees.
Ri Yong Ho told the board of residents that it took good measures last year, such as stopping the test of equipment and the dilapidation of parts equipped with Nuclear equipment, and also making a promise that we could no longer make Nuclear equipment again.
"However, we do not see the corresponding measures from the United States," he said.
"When there is no promise from the United States there will be no hope for our country's security and in this case we will not waste our weapons we can speak to the United States."
While RI also says the norm that has been said of North Korea about the US's refusal to complete Nuclear Instruments in terms of less than what North Korea has been awarded for small measures, his report has not denied what was done Pyongyang's decision to complete the miscellaneous weapons.
Ri said of a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first session between the U.S. President and the North Korean administrator in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work "to complete Nuclear weapons in place of Korea" during Trump's
North Korea wanted to end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyonyang should put an end to Nuclear weapons first.
Washington has undergone requests to reduce the heavy international sanctions facing North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "the completion of Nuclear Weapons first" and increases the level of judicial pressure to achieve their objective in a strict manner, citing the declarations of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that judgments can be scary is a false dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that these judgments increase confidence."
Ri did not discuss plans with Kim and Trump, which the U.S. holiday spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead, the Commissioner spoke of three meetings between Kim and the South Korean ruler Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party in this case exceeds the Nuclear equipment it is south of Korea and not the United States, is it to complete the Nuclear equipment instead of Korea."
However, Ri's speech sounds different than last year, when speaking to a general convention in the U.N. that the target of North Korean flying weapons in the U.S. was inevitable after "Mr. Evil" Trump calls Kim "a man of flying weapons" that you want to kill.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened "complete destruction" in North Korea, gave Kim a courageous praise for taking measures to disarm the arms, but which says it has a lot of advanced work and the judgments will remain far from North Korea to complete Nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a deadline for that, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter"
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should say Pyongyang's actions have taken place.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's rulings has not continued strongly until we have seen the completion of Nuclear equipment completely and certainly."
The Security Council has expanded its judgments in accordance with North Korea since 2006 with the end of the funding of the Nuclear flying equipment system of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri over the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second session.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyonyang in July saying that it is more than a pre-made move, but North Korea ruled out that he made "a demand similar to those perpetrated by criminals."
North Korea pledged to meet the Moon this month so that they could break into the position of Nuclear flying equipment that the United States had "consistent measures."
Kim told him that the "consistent measures" required for Trump's security assurances are promising in Singapore and progress in a common relationship with Washington
The students of Harvard take a break-up lesson
A new study at Harvard University this year made all students who do not have enough luggage for the purpose of fighting the culture of learning all night using caffeine."
Another expert found that students in the university are not aware of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, made this study, believed to be the first such in the United States.
He was inspired by his speech about the effects of sleep on learning.
"When we finished one of their classes the other girl came to the table and said, 'Why am I told what I am now, I'm going to finish school?'
He told me that no one ever told me the importance of sleep - that's what I was surprised," he told The Telegraph.
The study started this year, explaining the benefits of sleep on the development of education and sports, including improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychological studies at Harvard Medical School and a senior director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to bring the study back after finding students who did not sleep sufficiently.
This study takes about an hour to complete a series of exciting activities.
In one section there is a picture of the university's bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and books for the purpose of clarifying the effects of caffeine and light and how insomnia has affected the development of sports.
In one section, participants were told that insomnia is not enough to increase the risk of heart attack, one-sided disease, depression, and cancer.
The school map, with interesting features, encourages participants to think about what they are doing every day.
"We know that we will never change the behavior of the disciples" right away.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as you also have the right to know the health effects on smoking beans," says Professor Czeisler.
The culture of self-reliance is still present, which says, adding that the current technology and pressure for students who are not falling asleep is a growing problem
To make sure that you're asleep enough should be an unknown tool to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - and also to avoid obesity, as insomnia is a mental disorder, it makes it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and biological sciences, helped Professor Czeisler make a study of this class, after attending his first class in his first year in Harvard.
She said the school had opened her eyes and gave her an interest in making the school accessible to the whole school.
He hopes that the next step is to ask students who are loaded to make the same learning process before entering the competition.
Czeisler cautions that students think that they make an alum of sleep time, as well as a wake, whether they are alerting the harmful effects of mechanical lighting and LED lighting, which may interfere with the sequence of your daily activities, which can lead to problems of sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers Menga defeated Gerrard's men by one point
The Rangers faced a problem again when playing in a walk-off while Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrad with one point in the starting (1-0) at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were interested in winning it for the first time after St Johnstone beat it 4-1 on February. but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games that started as manager as if he missed eight points without a running-forward team at Ladbrokers Prekes.
Menga received a note on the back of the half-time and the Rangers' players were uninterested.
While the Rangers advanced in sixth place, Livingston went up third behind it by Hibernian leaving with one point.
And there are problems that come to Rangers after the linesman Calum Spence suffered from a head injury after he was struck by a torn object from the side of the players who had gone.
Gerrard has changed the players from time to time with Ayr in the game before the last Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continued with the same players of Livingstone who took the same point on Hearts last week and rejoiced the way his team played their opponents in every way.
The Rangers dominated the game but Livingstone did not do it further while receiving the ball.
It should have played a second half while Menga's player allowed Scott Pittman to pass to Allan McGregor's lap but the midfielder didn't get it.
Keaghan Jacobs kicked the ball by Craig Halkett, but his partner Alan Lithgow managed to open wide on the back panels.
The Rangers did not gain control but seemed more optimistic than the third game before the final.
Alredo Morelos feels that he should get a penal ring on the half hour mark as he and Steve Lawless clashed but referee Steve Thomson did not give up the call of the Colombian player.
The Rangers had the opportunity to kick the ball up with the pals before finishing the first stage of the game but Ibrox player Liam Kelly didn't get a problem with the ball tied to Lassana Coulibaly's head and accompanied by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that had been difficult to find, no one would deny that it was really worth it without just working hard at all.
The Rangers also failed to prevent the ball from being stolen by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not act like Declan Gallagher who sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was not worried about the goal of winning Menga.
Gerrard made a change at the beginning as Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent with the change that gave him the results immediately as the player opened up for Morelos but this outstanding player even ran away from the miner.
But Livingston has continued to make the team play on the way to play what they want, and Lithgow and Halkett have kicked the ball away again.

Almanac: The Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the scientific day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born to Germany.
Geiger developed a method of searching and measuring the efficiency of the blades, which was produced through this development of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
It has been used since then, Geiger Counter has also been used in pop culture as well, as being featured in a 1950 film show known as "Bells of Corondao," which has interesting players who are unlikely to become scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger Counter, used to look for precious stones.
When you put these things into your ears, you'll hear the effects of Atoms that are released from the function of the nucleus."
Evans: "Speak, it's real!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, after a few days of his 63rd birthday.
But this vision with his name will continue.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the body's digestive system to 'see' heavy cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the body's diets to "see" heavy cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the body's digestive system to see complex cells as part of the treatment
How to do this involves releasing cells of the body vessels from the patient, and adjusting them to the lab
Therefore, "seem" the normal proteins in the cancer and are recycled back into the body.
The vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
Another hippocampus who received treatment for the tooth, which teaches body fats to see abnormal cells in the body, saw an endocrine cancer after 18 months of age.
How to do this involves releasing the cells of the body vessels from the patient, and converting them to the laboratory until they "see" the normal proteins in the cancer known as HER2, and restoring it to the body again.
Jay Berzofsky, a U.S. National Cancer Center based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have an inefficient vaccine."
ER2 "gives the growth of a variety of interesting cancers." including breast cancer, ovarian, nausea, and uterine, explains the university's professor Berzofsky.
The same method of removing body fats from patients and "teaching" to search for cancer cells has worked at the heart of the leukaemia type.

You're free.
"We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper informed his followers on Twitter that he had officially changed his name, saying he was known as "Just West."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.

China reported that it increased the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14<0x25>.
More than 820,000 people have been affected by the country, officials say.

But the number of people affected in this way has been reduced to a complete loss, the Chinese medical officials say in a Yunnan ring.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a real problem in the LGBT community in China.
Racism is no longer the most prevalent in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be difficult.

Sexual harassment is often not safe enough for the sexuality of this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged access to HIV medicine as part of the deal.
Maxine Waters denies details about GOP opponents released by an employee from the office, there was a "hard lie" and "speaks things that are happening"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denies allegations that one of his employees has posted personal information of a fellow American Republican Senator to Wikipedia.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, the allegations were filed by experts and veterinarians who took their side.
"A lot of lies, lies, and lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
According to reports of details released from home addresses and telephone numbers still in the US. Lindsey Graham is in the south and Carolina, with Mike Lee including Orrin Hatch, Utah's.
The suspects appeared on the internet on Thursday, placed by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at a time more than a bribe talk about non-violence and charges of indiscrimination by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Johnny's English Strikes Again - A copy of Rowan Atkins
It is common for days to look for things about Brexit when watching a movie that is related to English has been similar to that of the long-awaited horror movie and the brutal comedy Johnny English - which was released in 2003 and returned in 2011 is named after Johnny English.
Would you like to talk about the fact that we don't have the ability to get rid of the world?
A man with a pony face named Johnny English finds his license to revive - this is his name which indicates that he is a scapegoat for non-English audiences in other countries.
He is indeed a public work of an uncle and animator that makes it different from Clouseau's small size, and Mr. Bean and at least the other beaa based on the song article of one of the Charities of Fire in the event of opening the London Olympics in 2012.
He even became a traveler with a mysterious man known all over the world to Atkinson who co-wrote Barclaycard's television advertisements, which sparked a controversy of the spin-off.
There's only one or two songs in the movie JE.
I love this time Johnny English came to the helicopter in front of the security outfits while he was on the verge of beating his hat.
Atkinson's non-fiction comic gift is interesting, but it is not as strong compared to heavy products such as 007 and Mission Impossingle which includes now-definitions.
These jokes are like looking for children not adults, when I speak on my side of Johnny English's laughs do not show how much skill compared to the silent movie of Atkinson while playing Bean
The story of the movie is that the English people are in serious trouble.
The wireless operator entered the wireless network, seeing the details of all of the active English spies, until he dismissed the employee's address - a very limited role of Kevin Eldon.
The news has come to pass with a high-profile, political dissident: Emma Thompson is trying to do the right thing as she plays Teresa May but the film's author does not do well when she writes
Wise counselors told him that as all spies are at risk, it is necessary to bring back a retired person.
And that's what the fool Johnny English himself, who has inherited the position of head teacher at a good school, but offers lessons on the injustice of being an anonymous character, while English teaches in an unusual way how to become a shyer than in real times.
English was returned to Whitehall and told of an emergency meeting with his best friend, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is a married man, married to the ruler of the underwater ship.
The couple who has the ability to do the wrong things in the civil service come back to work, meeting Ophelia Butletova with Olga Kurylenko.
While, a senior administrator believes a billion-dollar technology rich that we can fix these problems with the English computer: the evil person Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
English and Bough began the feud: they made food donors, burned a French food store; they started trouble when they boarded the Volta rich ship; and English brought the attack while trying to use clothing on the head of Virtual Reality for the purpose of learning the house.
Everything has been done in the final sections, although it's interesting and fun, it's more than children's television programs that talk about it all.
common dreams.
Like all the other Johnny English movies: Did I ask myself that the English film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a proper role in his abilities?
The Labour Party denies that it makes a plan for British citizens to work for four days but has been paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's work group makes a plan to make employees work four days a week - but they are paid for a five-day salary.
According to reports, the company's managers need employees to be paid for the amount obtained when companies operate Artificial Intelligence (AI) by providing them a day.
This change will allow employees to have a three-day weekend, but they are paid the same amount.
The sources state that the plan will be "well suited" to the economic ideas of the group and the plan of the country's exchange took the side of the employees
A four-day shift to the support of the Union Trades Union Congress as a means for employees to take the opportunity to change the economy.
The top source of the Labour Party has told the Sunday Times: â€œA review of programs is expected to have been announced before the end of the year.
"We're not going to happen immediately but a four-day working week is the ideal idea of this new economic measurement team to be on the side of the employees and the business plan of the group."
The Labour Party was not the first to provide support for such an idea, and the Green Party made a four-day plan while raising support for the 2017 election.
In the meantime, this program does not receive full support from the Labour Party, however.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a team process and it is not a matter of consideration."
Assistant manager John McDonnell used the previous week's work conference to explain his idea of an economic transformation that helps people.
McDonnell's secretary says he is determined to take the power to 'rules who do not want to be seen by a person' and 'beneficiaries' in big business.
The program of the assistant manager says that the owners of the machine who sell water may not receive their share as the government of the labor force would not pay for the 'payment' saying they are not doing well.
He also confirmed his plan to put employees in office positions in the business and create a private fund that includes everyone for the purpose of providing employees with a share of 10 percent of non-government businesses that don't pay them a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the "60 Minutes" that the FBI could change the standard
FBI investigations of allegations placed on jury Brett Kavanaugh announced the final vote for his deportation to the Supreme Court a week, and raised a question that whether the results of the investigation of the center could change the Republican's remaining members to change their minds with the support they gave them.
In an interview broadcast by Sonto, the reporter for the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham that if the FBI could find something that would make them worship mentally.
Kennedy had a problem talking about his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I'm going to go into the room, I'll talk to the judge Kavanaugh."
When I asked him, he said, "What have you done?"
He was calm, confident, and not afraid."
However, it seems that Graham's vote would never change.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be a tough joke," he said.
Gqirh.Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett has denied the strength of these charms," added Graham, speaking to Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who speaks about him can confirm these accusations.
It's 36 years
I don't see change."

The U.S. may use a naval force to interfere with Russia's nuclear deterrent - The Interior Secretary
The U.S. can find a safe haven under the navy for the purpose of preventing Russia from destroying gas power, assembling it with the Middle East, explaining the Secretary of the Interior in the United States, Ryan as a whole, according to the Washington Examiner.
All of them have made accusations that Russia is responsible in Syria - where they work under the government legally - they make a plan to explore new ways of making electric power.
"I believe that their goal for the Middle East is to be because they want to sell other countries as Europe has done in eastern Europe, in the middle of South Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and strengths to deal with.
"The United States has the power, by the navy, to make sure that its sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that the power of gas for those who have not gone into the truth," he said.
All spoke to those present in a matter accepted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling it "a voice that used gas energy" in the United States.
He also compared America's approach to Russia and Iran, which he said has not changed yet.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia, almost certainly, increase prices and yield to replace them," he said, while calling on Russia with a balloon that can do the same thing that hopes in the power of natural gas.
The report comes after Trump's government made efforts to promote exporting European-made water gas, entering Russia's position, with no higher prices for Europeans.
As a result, Trump's government officials, including U.S. regulator Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the "unofficial" job of Nord Stream 2, according to Trump's work has done Germany's "undocumented" of Russia.
Russia has also stated that the Nord Stream 2 package worth <0x24>11 billion, which is twice the current one to be 110 billion cubic meters, is a very good economic activity.
The US opposition to this work has economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe that energy should not be a force to press, and customers are forced to be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position in this situation was not well received in Germany which confirmed its determination to do so.
The leading center in the industry, the Federal Trade Center of Germany (BDI), has requested that the United States move far from the EU's energy policies and agreements with Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third country is disrupting our powers." says Dieter Kampf, head of the Federal Trade Center for Germany (BDI) after a meeting with German manager Angela Merket, Russian ambassador Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren has been "critically critical" to enter the federal election in 2020, saying that the Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday, "he will consider it difficult" to enter the presidential election after a half-time election.
In the city hall of Holyoke, Warren of Massachusetts, is confident that he will enter the election.
"It's time for the elite to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes having a high-ranking man in the top position," the Hill said.
"After November 6, I will consider it difficult to enter the presidential election."
Warren spoke harshly about President Donald Trump in the city hall, saying his father "is on the wrong road.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump will do for our freedoms," he said.
Warren is known for his criticism of Trump and his arrest of the Supreme Court Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Writing on Twitter on Friday, Warren said "we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, polls released on Thursday show that many Warren supporters think it's not a good idea to enter the election in 2020.

Three-and-a-half of them gave support to this idea.
The polls showed a lot of support at the old Democratic Party's Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of the vote

Usarah Palin speaks of Track Palin's PTSD for Trump's
Track Palin, 26, has been in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested on charges of domestic violence and Monday night.
"What my son hears, he hears me again, I feel like other families facing the PTSD problems and the other injuries our soots come back to me." he tells the audience at Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The U.S. and D.C. Government Sections provide support to break the new law and seek protection
Eighteen state and area parts of Columbia provide support to deny a new law that denies the victims of gangs or domestic violence.
The Commissioners of the 18 federal and regional sectors have filed a petition to provide support to one of the victims seeking protection against this law, according to the NBC.
The full name of the plaintiff in this case is between Grace and Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union which was held in August about the illegal national legislation.
He said that he and his family's "violent sons," abused him, but the U.S. officials denied his request for security on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas
State sector representatives provide Grace with support for El Savador, Honduras and Guatemala, which is the largest of these areas that attract many people to need security in the United States, such as areas facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
This new law on seeking security in the United States brings the 2014 decision made by a board of whistleblowers that allowed the fugitives to flee from domestic violence to obtain security.
Columbia's general representative Karl Racine issued a statement on Friday saying that the new law "takes old laws, public sector, national and global laws"
"The national laws require that all disciplinary applications be considered in accordance with the facts and conditions of the application, and this law shall violate that," said a statement filed in the press.
The U.S. attorneys have also stated that this law prohibits the immigrants from entering the United States of America from harming the American economy, saying that they may be available for business and doing the necessary jobs."
General Representative Jeff Sessions issued a law to the judge that the fugitives would be given protection if they fled the domestic violence or violence of gangs from June.
"Security will be obtained by anyone who has gone home because of persecution or because of concern for race, religion, or political opinion," said Sessions on June 11 where he reported the law.
Security has not been designed to deal with all the problems - even the difficulties - people who deal with them every day around the world.
Attempts to quickly recover from Palu as the dead couple's
For those who have survived, the situation was extremely difficult.
"It's really hard," says a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who fires her crying son instead of security in the city of Palu
"At a minute of a car for patients who have died"
"It's not easy to clean water"
The inhabitants of the city went out into the streets and drove out their belongings that they knew, trying to save everything that they could.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitalised by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some people who have been injured, including Dr. Harris, who has broken back and forth, rest outside the cell at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to minor earthquakes
Nearly the time he spoke about how he felt while the earth felt because of the earthquake as the fifth satellite in Hotela with his partner and his child.
"There was no time to save them.
"I got into two walls, I think of it," said Harris to the Associated Press, adding that his family had reached a marriage.
"I heard my husband cry and call me when I come back to the house.
I don't know what's wrong with my son.
I hope you're safe now
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of now being "suspended" by using "false bribes"
A week later, the official newspaper of China made a four-page advertisement in the U.S. paper every day talking about the benefits of American and Chinese trade, a US representative in China accused the country of using American media to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week said on the China Daily's announcement to the DesMoines Register - the most expensive newspaper in Iowa - to sue China for its purposes to disrupt the November 6, China's rejection of election.
Trump's indictment that China is trying to disrupt elections is something the U.S. officials told Reuters that the new part of the campaign that the U.S. has put pressure on China.
Whether it's normal for governments in different countries to introduce them to promote trade, China and the United States are fighting for trade at the moment and putting in value that has not yet been added.
China adds prices to the beginning of the trade crisis and is designed to affect foreign goods retailers in governmental sectors such as Iowa is setting up a Trump Republican group, experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. representative in China and former governor of Iowa, who reprised China with a large portion of the mineralized food chain, said that China has injured American employees, farmers, and businesses.
In China, Brianstad wrote his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "it is now determined to exploit us by placing false advertisements on our pages as free."
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government puts it at risk of hearing America using its usual tradition of free speech and free news and advertising site at Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"Unlikely, instead of the news here in Beijing when it comes down the strato, you'll find little ideas that break apart and you'll never see how China really thinks about the economic boom in China, we think you're feeling that the news isn't going beyond the Chinese imperialist group," he writes.
He added that "one of the most common newspapers in the world has denied his request to remove this issue" regardless of what the newspaper is.
The Republican expelled the people before the election of the half with Kavanaugh's problem, warning analysts
Just like Republicans in high positions on the side of High Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and protecting him from his accusations, sexual abuse, analysts say they will see wildfire guns, especially for the people who have passed, in this upcoming election for the first half.
The feelings about this situation are overwhelming, and the Republicans say again that they want to continue the election.
You can't get those things back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School who tells The Hill while writing an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher says she is wondering if the last time Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) efforts to start an FBI investigation could change the level of angry voters.
"People who are overweight won't forget what has happened tomorrow - they won't be tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker of the Progressive Party on Friday, according to Washington, the D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protestors again said "He's coming to November!" who walked into the world as a Republican ruled the Justice Committee and decided to continue Kavanaugh's kidnapping and despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"The interest in freedom and encouragement is great," said St. Rothenberg, a non-partisan analyst, telling the media.
"People have started to say that it's over right now, this is true.
But it may be much more than that, especially for people who do not decide who will vote for who and the new voters, who are 18-29 years old, who although they do not like the candidate but are not familiar with the vote."
Even before the evidence of Ford's public statements explaining the allegations he has about the High Court's perpetrator of sexual abuse, analysts say it may have negative consequences when Republicans need a warrant.
"This is a problem with the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman last week when he started, according to NBC News.
"It doesn't matter if a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh enters into a constituency, about how Republicans deal with the situation and how they treat him like," says Guy Cecil in the media center, director of the United States Parties, a team that helps Democrats elected
However, the Anglicans seem unaware of who believed between Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's testimony, even though there are a few who take the side of his hearing.
41<0x25> who participated in another poll showed that they are likely to believe in or fully believe in Ford's evidence, while 35 percent showed that it is possible to fully believe in or completely believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent believed that Kavanaugh could possibly have been convinced that he was lying while giving evidence, at the same time only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake was exposed to interest, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and another Devil, Deborah Ramires, according to The Guardian.
Ford issued a statement filed before the Justice Committee held last week that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted 18-year-old Kavanuagh.
Ramirez alleged that the High Court's defendant had filed a complaint with him while he was still studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The internet developer makes a plan to create a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an internet developer, begins a new business with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technology color has a new Inrupt system, which is a Solid manufacturing business that is available to everyone.
Solid allows users to choose which of their personal data is stored in the location and who has the permission to see the details.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee discussed the purpose of Inrupt, which is "to control the whole world."
"We have to do it right now," he said.
"A moment you didn't run away"
This non-technical system allows people to create a "maintaining database" or POD.
It can include a list of phone numbers, a list of things you have to do, a calendar, your music and other personal and professional activities.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are in one place at the same time.
It's different from the data storage area to choose the user what one can see.
The company calls it "personalized by knowledge."
The Inrupt Program, according to the top business executive John Bruce, to introduce tools, programs and related skills in order to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently owns Berners-Lee, Bruce, a system purchased by IBM, workers that are simulcasting this system and the community of manufacturers who work independently.
Since this week, technology manufacturers around the world can present a process that they have made all of them uniquely using the methods available for internet sex.
Berners-Lee said he and his group said "and Facebook and Goodle about whether to release a major change that could make their business worse.
"We will not ask for their consent."
"Berners-Lee said when he wrote to Medium on Saturday that the purpose of Inrupt "to provide interesting businesses and places to protect integrity and the quality of a new internet made with Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed Inthane while making the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the real world, Berners-Lee is still an influential voice in this online chat.
And when it is officially opened in Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the manufacturer and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Center for Internet and the Open Data Center.
"I'm very happy with the new internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The pastor of Victoria Cross by WW1
It was the first and last to win the Victoria Cross during the World War.
Lt. Col. teacher Bernard Vann acquired the post on 29 September 1918 while it was attacked in Ballenglise and Lehauccourt.
However, he was killed by a cat-man who shot until he died unaware that 4 wickets had earned him the highest award in Britain.
The memorial stone was opened by his two grandchildren in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the announcement of a stone visit was easily forgotten because it has been heard after 100 years since his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann built the men under him to pass the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "with heavy fog and heavy guns and machine guns."
Kamiva fled to the shooters and was very courageous he took the big guns and machine guns on his own.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German who had a cat's arm shot to the point of 4 October 1918 - more than a month for the war to end.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions "are what he knows that he will never be able to do but he said he is humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann set up a made-up history after he shot the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says that he feels "great as if he had been forced to leave the show" he added that "the courage of the true hero is manifested by people who offer more support."
The MMA fans didn't sleep to see Bellator 206, but only Peppa Pig
Think of it now, you don't get to sleep because you want to see Bellator 206 just to meet and say it won't play.
The San Jose long program has 13 missiles, including three transmitters that are distributed at night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., during the meeting with Gerard Moussa and Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were surprised when they saw the change to play Peppa Pig.
Some are disappointed as if they stayed all night and early in the morning to see the army.
One of the leaders described the story as an evil spirit.
"The government's law that from 6 a.m. the procedure was not yet appropriate so they had to switch to child care," said the chairman of Bellator's advertising and communications, when asked about it.
"Pippa the pig," yes.
Bellator's president Scott Coker said he would change their next time so that the UK viewers could watch.
When I think about it again and again, I think it's possible," said Coker,
"The problem is that the time is six o'clock in the morning is not what we can do to make that happen until tomorrow comes to them.
But we're going to have a plan
Believe me, when you're new to this, it's a lot of fun and it's all fun.
We tried to fix it, first we thought it was the problem of our machine.
However, it was not a government problem.
I promise you never again.
We're going to cut the army into a sx - as a test - and we're trying to figure out what they've expected but as if we had done so much.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels like he's "too young" for his sexuality
Tom Daley says he has grown young because of his sexuality - but he has given him an interest in winning.
The 24-year-old said I saw where I was in second grade school that "I'm not like anyone else."
Speaking to the first program of Desert Island Discs by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she says of the rights of gay people to give them "hope."
He said that if he was a parent, he would not take care of the Olympics.
The usual manager of the program, Kirsty Young, has heard a few months pregnant due to illness.
When Daley appeared as an abandoned man in Laverne's first camp, Daley says he felt the youngest of all while growing up because "it was not allowed to love girls."
He said: "It's been a day for me to feel lonely and different, and it's the most interesting and powerful thing to do."
He wanted to say that "it's something," which he said, so that he wouldn't be ashamed of everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The winner of the double-double Olympics has made public mention of the LGBT and used his reputation this year to the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask the countries who have not yet been informed to make the case more formal.
He said that because he's so lucky to be able to live without interfering with problems and wanting to give others a "hope."
The three-part world champion said he was dating a man - the American film producer in 2013 - "unexpected."
Daley is married to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year but says that the post they left was not a problem.
"When you're dealing with things like a teenager" - he goes to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find a person who faces similar life problems.
The couple had their parents in June, they found a son of a young man who named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that "all his thoughts" have changed.
"I asked you last year to tell you that I needed to "get a gold hammer," he said.
"You know, it's a great deal to finish the Olympic Gold Medal.
"My dream is to go to Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after a doctor had a brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he would die and one of his last claims asked if they had any of London's tickets in 2012 - as if they wanted to stay ahead.
"I can't say 'You won't be in a place to stay ahead'," he says.
"I grabbed her hand when she decided to breathe and I saw that she could not be able to live forever," she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and gained our passion.
"I've seen that's what I've always dreamed of - pouring into the water in front of the crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better way I've ever heard," he said.
It was also interesting to say his first music - Proud performed by Heather Small - which always gave him an interest in the front of the vampires and threatened him.
Desert Island Discs is available on BBC Radio 4 with Sonto at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's non-league play-off was placed on the bench in the Ryder Cup game on Saturday.
Anglican Phil Mickelson will make a new record with Sonto when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game but is forced to change his playing style to make this unhappy record.
Mickelson, who plays in this event twice a year for 12 years, was drafted by Captain Jim Furyk in a 4-ball game with 4-man.
Instead of being held captive, as usual when playing for the United States, the winner of the fifth round uses half of his day's non-playing game and rehearses him for the purpose of fixing him a problem.
He is unable to play even though he is high in the game, the 48-year-old player is not well suited to playing in the Le Golf National, where there is a hole available and makes it difficult for bad football fans.
If you're a very scary player, Mickelson, in the ninth game of Sonto, is facing Francesco Molinari who's very well-rounded British Open football, who has worked with Tommy Fleetwood who learns to win all their games on this site.
While the Americans, less than 4 points, with a good start to 12 games going alone, Mickelson's game would be very important.
My husband has shown his trust as if he's expected.
"You've completely understood my role today, and you've hit me a little bit behind me, and you're going to be ready tomorrow."
"You're truly confident.
You've found a place in the hall of fame and added a lot more to the post-menopausal team last week, and this week.
I didn't think he could play two games.
I thought he would play more players than he did, but he didn't go as he thought he would go.
He wants people to know him, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass the record for Nick Faldo to play many games in the Ryder Cup in Sonto play.
He can make a decision to play in the Ryder Cup that doesn't match his record as a personal character.
Mickelson won 18 seasons, split 20 times with a half-wicket haul, even though Furyk said that he would be on the scoreless side of the team.
"You're funny, you're having fun, quick answers, you like to laugh at people, and you're a good guy to have him in the group room" he explains.
"I've always seen young players laughing at him in the park and having fun to see that."
"He's just giving you something."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that it's going to lose the position of fast pace
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that we can quickly lose the position of forward as a team is still ahead of the Ryder Cup but that can change at any time.
This match began playing in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballestros went ahead with five points more than the United States but ended in a tie, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2â€“131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'll tell them that you've got a lot of points in Valderrama; you have a lot of points in Brookline, where it's played with Valderrama, where we win, it's hard," says Bjorn, who's put in the picture, after watching the 2018 Classic win by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday's score is 10-6 Golf Le
It will teach me and everyone that I have not finished it.
We'll get everything we can tomorrow.
We will do everything we can to do.
This hasn't been completed until the articles on the board.
We have a goal, and it's about trying to win this state as our goal.
I've also said, I'm focusing on 12 players on my side, but we know we're dealing with everything in the same club - the players that's left out all over the world."
"I've never thought about it," Bjor added, "I've never thought about it.
The next day we talk about something different.
The next day, there's a look at the ability to play a person's own game, and that's a different thing.
When you're alone, you're trying to be a good partner, but when you're alone, you start testing your strength as a golfer.
This is a message that is supposed to be received by all players, which must be displayed tomorrow.
Now, you've never had your husband again."
Unlike Bjorn, a man on the other hand, Jim Furyk is looking for his players to play well on their own and not as a team, except for Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of eight.
Furyk and he became the second of the final day's revolutions, becoming the side of the Brookline when the victory and even when they were separated as if Europe made a "miracle in Medinah."
"I remember everything that he says," in response to Ben Crenshaw's 1999 captain, how did he become interested in the latter's adventures.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but we don't have to think about it as if you've seen it in Brookline and Medinah.
When you start winning each time, you put pressure on the ball in the first place.
"We're going to put our players on the stage and put them in a way that's going to have good results, you know, we want to make a magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been offered a career as a pay-per-viewer and is faced with high-profile Rory McIlroy, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter's high-profile Yurpohu.
"I'm going to go with this group of men because I think you're going through it all," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
Germany's warship has been canceled again.
A new jaleman ship should not be released in 2014 to enter the position of the warships known as the Cold War, but in the following year it will not be released due to ship problems and prices, it tells the news there.
The release of "Rheinland-Pfalz," a leading ship produced by Baden-Wuettermberg-class frigates, was delayed in the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit said the military spokesman.
This seal should not have entered the navy in 104, but the arrival of the goods has done so.
The four banks of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2007 and will enter the position of the Bremen fleet
It became possible that it would have a large powerful weapon, with the firing equipment of some ships and other aircraft and other technologies that would make it invisible to Radar, infrared and Acoustic.
Another important thing that takes a long time before it needs to be repaired - it can go for two years without home.
However, the ongoing disruptions make new ships - which are said to provide Germany with overseas powers - have been lost when they are depleted.
This wooden raft was issued in the yard last year, while the navy in Germany refused to smuggle the vessel back to Blom <0x26> Voss in Hamburg
This was the first time the navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after it had been launched.
Little is known about the reasons for the restoration of the ship's rear but the German media reports that there are problems in "the machinery and clothes" that make the ship work well which made the sail unusable during the war
Machinery became more common as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships used by 120 people at all - half of the people were forced to use the old Bremen.
In addition, it turns out that the mast has a very heavy weight to reduce its ability and that the water force will not be able to improve the future menstrual cycle.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" sailor is believed to be the second-largest ship to pass ships like those used for the second world war.
In addition to non-workable goods, the total cost of the work - including the cost of teaching employees to use it - begins to be a problem.
It is estimated to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion
The problems of new ships are important when it is revealed that the strength of the German navy is declining.
From the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the commander of the regional security committee in Germany, agreed that the navy "lost the ships into the war."
According to the official, the problem of old age has been ongoing, since older ships have been discharged from the military but not new installations.
He said that no other ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to enter the navy.
The New Trust is in charge of the news of flying animals such as the veterinarians
A new vaccine made in the Scottish Highlands seeks to explain how these animals use their environment to produce food.
It is hoped that the results will illuminate the way the animals behave and how they are safe.
This is a study conducted by the National Trust of Scotland who will follow these common animals, which make them angry as a soprano, with long bees and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in an important position in this area to see what they do in the middle of the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will make an assessment of the presence of the machine that is handled by hand.
Medical experts will explore what is recorded in order to show the frequency of animals they call and what this type of thing does.
A local map of these animals and reports will be made to create an image that reflects the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for NTS natural defenders, hopes that the results will be to see what location these animals like and what areas they are used for.
This information will help you understand the benefits of protecting wildlife habitats and how to maintain wildlife habitats.
The number of animals in Scotland and the UK has decreased over the past 100 years.
They are at risk for the construction and development of these habitats.
Air Turbines and light can put these animals at risk as well as flying leaflets and chemicals from buildings, as well as cat attacks.
These animals are not visible.
However, it is more likely that the daily diet of their ears is more frequent than their eyes when it comes to feeding them.
They eat their food by making anger while you go back to their ears can see which food they eat or the obstacles when they fly.
NTS, responsible for the care of some 270 old sites, 38 important walls and 76,000 hectares of land that do not live on the earth, thinks these animals are important.
It has ten trained specialists, which make up the brain again, the inspection of their accommodations and sometimes the rescue.
This institution has made a zoo for these fisheries only in Scotland in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, with 8 species.
David Thompson said the site is a suitable place for them.
"We have a beautiful place here," he said.
"We have old places, old trees and a beautiful place to stay.
There's so much you don't know about animals that don't know anyone, there's a job we do here and other places that will help us clarify what they need to live."
He says that the importance of studying these animals before taking care of a place is as important as the fact that an animal's child's habitat may be caused by 400 children's deaths, which does not end all about this.
These animals are safe and illegal to commit suicide, disrupting which has been exploited by them and their surroundings.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust official, encouraged the insider to visit us.
He said: "There's a lot to know about these animals and how many of their friends we don't know."
Ronaldo has denied accusations of rape and his agents will be charged with the German newspaper
Cristiano Rolando called the charges of rape as a lie, saying that people want to be surprised by his name.
His representatives will invest in the German media's Der Spiegel, which is the best to avoid these accusations.
The actor in Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping a U.S. woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel in 2009
It is said that he was fined <0x24>375,000 to say nothing about the damage, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram which is streaming to 142 million followers after just a few hours of these allegations have been made, Ronaldo, 33-year-old, has denounced it as "false."
"Be careful, just, not alone.
"What they didn't say, is a lie," said Ballon d'Or's fifth winner, who said in a camera.
"They want to know people by my name.
It is common.
They want to be known by my name, but it's common now.
"I'm happy and happy," added the player, laughing.
Ronalo's attorneys say they seek to pay Der Spiegel for these accusations that they have "unfortunately reported accusations of abuse of personal life," according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz says the actor wants to give a "spiritual injury due to the abuse of human rights in the past years."
The event is said to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting instead of drinking alcohol, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the player's room, where he raped her in the back, according to papers placed in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell to the knees after the injury was allegedly charged and said that he was "a good man" "99 percent" the problem is one percent.
The twins said that Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had slept together, but they agreed.
"Mayorga says he went to the police to take photos of their injuries to the hospital, but he heard them agree with each other outside the court because he felt that he would be back and worried about the reprisals."
The 34-year-old says he wants to get back to jail because he says he's still hurting Ronaldo.
Ronaldo was still joining Real Madrid from Manchester United during the event of this accusation, and this summer went to a large group of Italian Juventus sold for less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK is "eternal regret" for the loss of motorists
The UK "will regret forever" when it does not lose its leading position in producing cars after Brexit, says mechanical secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was concerned that Toyota in the UK told the BBC that Britain could travel to the EU over a dispute that it would be slow to produce in their day in Burnaston, up to Derby.
"We need a connection," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the stress of leaving the goods on the border when there is no distribution station in Brexit can complete the work.
Burnaston production â€“ which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis â€“ produced nearly 150,000 cars a year ago that 90 percent of the vesolo have been exported to the European Union.
"My idea that if Britain goes to the EU when it comes to the conclusion of the Mashi, we will see the production stop in our production," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have expressed their fears over the passage of the EU without a compromise on how to trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its daily production in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
A serious concern about this situation can also pose a risk for transactions when there is no connection to Brexit.
Toyota's production schedule is carried out with a "time-to-time" system, with car goods arriving every 37 minutes from retailers from the UK and the EU for the purpose of producing cars for immediate purchase.
Even if the UK travels to the EU without a payload by 29 March, it may be a drawback to the border in which the industry says it could be a burden and arbitrary goods.
It will never happen that Toyota has a jealous day production in Derbyshire, says the business, and the production will stand.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for relations with the EU "is designed to address the problem of border inspection."
"We need a merger. We need a very good link that will allow us to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 in a forum called Today.
"The evidence not only came from Toyota but also from other manufacturers explains that we need to continue where we were in full-fledged production."
Toyota did not appear as to how long the production lasts, and said in a long period of time, warning him that the rising prices will reduce the competitive ability over time to complete the work.
Peter Tsoullavaris who worked for Burnaston for 24 years and has been in the Union for this mission says that some of the concerns I've been working again. "The time I've been working I know that when it's going this work will never come back."
According to the government's spokesman, "We have provided a reliable plan for the future relationship with the EU
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be postponed again, says the U.S. President's Office
Donald Trump's most important meeting with general founder Rod Rosenstein can be postponed one week as the fight for high court court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the president said.
Rosenstein is focusing on the work of special economist Robert Mueller, who investigates the suffrage of Russia's election, as well as the assembly between Trump's and Russia's shoulders and the disruption of the power of the law by the president
Trump says he has expelled another from the general representative, risking Mueller's independence, has been the cause of a lot of gossip in Washington over the past months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein said that he would wear something that records Trump's argument with the possibility of removing the channel with 25 amendments.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day he went to the White House, among the reports he was going to withdraw
Instead, a meeting together
Trump said he "did not choose" to dismiss Royentein but then the meeting was delayed to judge a dispute in the House of Commons hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women charged with sexual immorality, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both presented evidence.
On Friday, Trump authorized a one-week FBI investigation on allegations against Kavanaugh, which has brought the Senate's total vote to a by-election.
Trump's press secretary, Mrs. Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The day it was not used, otherwise this week, I realized that the next week was given all the other events in the high court.
But we'll see and always like to keep the Express updated."
Some researchers argue: Sanders did not run the White House line from 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to the disruption of the TV market "greaters," although he said: "I'm not going to agree with the fact that they're watching."
He advised that he had a direct connection between Trump and the growing press.
"The President made <0x51><0x26>A sessions and sessions more than any president before," he added without mentioning the evidence: "Look at those figures."
Reports will occur, Sanders said, but "If the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's better than you talk to me.
We try to do that and you've seen him do a lot in the last few weeks and it will take the place of the printing press when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or combining rallies with more outgoing sentences.
Social media is a disaster.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, having made freewheeling and some time unseen before meeting the press.
The Secretary of Health writes to the staff of the EU in the NHS Scotland about Brexit's fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to Scottish EU employees in the NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to stay in the Post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter for less than six months to the UK to withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish government has dedicated itself to meeting the cost of EU citizenship applications working in public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU withdrawal have continued, focusing on the most anticipated decisions in the summer.
However, the UK government has set out its provisions regarding the impossible situation.
I know that this has to be a huge problem for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate and appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of the country.
Brothers from all over the EU, and more, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we use.

Abercrombie iChrisby Ingoes Surgery Emergency After Healing Head Injury
Tennessee State quarterback Chris Abercrombie was elected immediately after a head injury on Saturday 31-27 at Vanderbilt Commodores, a statement by Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Department's head coach Rust Reed told the press that the injury occurred shortly before the deadline.
"He came to the sideline and fell to the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff offered an abercrombie oxygen in a way before placing him on the floor and restoring him to testing.
A police officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not admitted to Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "information in the form<0x2F> magnitude of injury at the moment" and Tennessee State is trying to find out if it happens to be an injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore (Junior at the University, but only in their 2nd year of college football), the first vacation with the Tennessee State after being transferred to Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before he left the game, which brought his full time to 18 Tests.
Customers will be charged when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged when buying property in the UK and additional funds used to help homeowners under the new Tory plans.
The rise will reduce the success of the Corbyn riding to attract young voters
The rise of the stamp duty will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The fund is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless
Customers of other ads are used to pay at the highest level of stamp duty when purchasing goods in the UK - and additional funds used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring it today.
The rise will be seen as an attempt to reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract small voters by means of pledges to provide affordable housing and focus on getting the top ones.
The rise of the stamp work will be paid by people and tax-free cafes in the UK, as well as additional funds to improve Russia's driving to fight sleep.
The additional fee for the modern stamp work, including the high levels placed in the past two years in two households and the purchase-for-age could be 30 percent.
The fund is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13<0x25> of the new buildings built in London are purchased by UK-based citizens, to move prices and make it difficult for the first customers to get a foot at the housing level.
Most of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend their time in the country.
A new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked that the stamp be cut to help new people with their homes.
He accused large firms in the construction of maintaining high-quality property prices by clearing the land but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to stop the platforms from being purchased in order to repair the British "house disgrace."
Mr. Corbyn has introduced a list of eye inspections for proposed houses, including the control of the rent and the end of the release.
You also want to offer a lot of new homes to build new homes.
Mr. May said: "In the past year I said I'd give your premiership to restore the dream of Britain - that life would be better for every new generation.
This means to fix our home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be easy for people who don't see in the UK, as well as externally based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British citizens.
For so many people the dream of a homeowner has been far away, and the destruction of painful sleep remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My upper hand is to control Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "highest praise" is that he is a Scottish manager on a certain level.
Scots, 42, describes the challenge of relegation to the North-East club, currently occupying third place in the League One, three placed higher.
He moved to St. Mirren's Stadium of Light in this month after leading St. Mirren to Scotland's premiership.
I want to play my country as a player.
I've got a B-side and I'm saying, "Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Henden very much with me as a kid, and it's always my protection.
"It's going to happen, even if I win the club."
Ross's principals as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he did not have the courage to follow the cross names in the big club, which had already dropped points from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It's a success for me at this time that will be followed by "Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities in the game, there is no doubt that in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to find it, but maybe I'll just look at it if I win here to get back to the team."
Ross was only three years in his career as a caretaker, after a time as a helper in Dumbarton and 15 days in Coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa lose in the third inning, and changed St Mirren from the point of support to the Championship level in the following match.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he did during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It could have been a real thing," he recalled, taking Alloa.
"I really believe that management is better for me than playing.
It sounds beautiful because I did it well, I did a good life in it, and I enjoyed it so much.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do for each event.
I'm still doing that in terms of stress and stress, but the management feels right.
I always wanted to control and now I do that, feeling that I am free to be in my pocket all my life."

The summer of the heatwave has encouraged the release of heavy British bridges but has been more concentrated in restaurants.
Pub and bar teams see sales of 2.7 per cent in July - but taking in restaurants fell to 4.8 per cent, shown the number.
Peter Martin, of Consumer Business CGA, which assembled the figures, said: "The solar movement with England is longer than expected to take part in the Julay World Cup following the same example in the previous year of June, when pubs rose by 2.8 centimetres, except for the rocks.
The collapse of 1.8<0x25> in the retail store in June has increased dramatically in July.
Insulated transport labs and valves are made more than they are like the taste of things that are more than the low feeding facilities.
Food-resistant bubbles were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not just as extreme as steamers.
People seem to want to get out of the drink.
In the whole of the pubs carried with drinking valves was more than 6.6 percent in the month, with a three percent diet."
Paul Newman, analysts for the delay and reception of travelers, said: "The results are continuing with the wind we have seen since April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sports events are often the main factors when it comes to selling on an outdoor market.
It's no surprise that the store teams continue to fight, although the drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be especially painful at the ongoing costs.
The hot summer has not come in a very bad time for leading food drivers and time will tell that the hot temperatures taken in August will give you a lot of breath."
The overall sales growth in pubs and stores, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the improvement of branding.

One of five children - some as young as 11 children - replace social media accounts that keep confidential to adults.
A study of 20,000 students in high school has shown a rapid growth in the "Instake Insta account" - referring to Instagram share site.

Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the players" at the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was selected on the board of the Scottish Athletics as the non-director at the regular meetings of the annual convention.
Doyle is a Scottish driver and Scottish actor and internet chair Ian Beattie described walking as a great opportunity for those who led the games to gain their highest international experience over the last ten years.
"Eilidh has great respect for all over Scotland, the UK and the sport community in the world and we are sure that Scottish Athletics will benefit by pulling him out of the board," Bettie said.
Doyle said: "I like to do as a voice of players and hope that I can help you and help you lead the game in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games between the Olympic golds and now the BBC regularly pundit, has been left unable to walk after the abuse of the schemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "In the past month, I'm very happy.
I didn't leave.

Comparison of women's and cattle's views on the internet
The breast pump company separates the idea of online advertising and advertising that identifies young mothers from caught cattle.
Establishing the introduction of the so-called "first-breastable bump," the company's technical company Elvie has published a theme for themusic-in-cheek inspired video show to show new freedoms the poster offers to voice mothers.
Four mothers have dances in a barn filled with cowboys in the streets including sounds such as: "Yes, I'm a woman, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these things, they're not."
Chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed the baby, pump it, pump it, and put it on my girls."
However, the advertisement, printed on the filename page, has made a controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, many say it means "disgusting" in the milk industry.
"The best solution is to use cattle to express this product.
Just as they should be pregnant and breastfeeding to produce milk, unless their babies are cut off from them they don't last for the days of childbirth," writing one.
Elvie's chest gun is closely related to inside the maintenance bar (Elvie<0x2F>Mother)
She said: "I'm very worried about my mother and child.
But why don't you use a pimp pump for mothers who will save their children?"
Another person added: "The lack of advertising."
One of them is a woman who admits that she has found a "clean" song.
"I think that's the idea of humanity.
I'll have only one to fill.
It made me feel like a cow.
The announcement was a bit painful, but I took it.
"It's a mental product," he wrote.
One said: "This is a beautiful recipe aimed at pump mothers (usually in their working or bathrooms) and feels like "the cows."
This is not a declaration of praise or judgement of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all playing together with the bumper pumps.
The theme behind the campaign is based on the sense that many of the well-known women of the temple claim to feel like a cow.
The Elvis Pump is, completely calm, there is nowire or cassava and is tightly aligned within the penis, giving women the freedom to travel, hold their children, and leave.
Anna Balarin, an associate with ECD to Mother, said: "Elvie's breath is such a versatile product that deserves the start of the sound and touch.
By showing the similarities between showing women and dairy cows that we wanted to put on breastfeeding and all the problems that appear, while reflecting on how fun and beautiful freedoms the new freedom will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvis has made a story.
During the week of the Fordon in Mondon, the mother of two children appeared in the documentary film Martha Jakubowski while using this product.
A lot of people are busy at Texas Border Center.
The number of children used to migrate has come out even though the movement of monthly rings remains unchanged, due to the section that heavy management and policies made by Trump for managing make it difficult to place children and supporters.
Traditionally, many supporters have become foreign, and have threatened their ability to live in this country by continuing to call a child.
The risk is increased in June, when government authorities confirm that clients who can benefit from and other senior members of their homes must place fingerprints, and that data will be shared with the authorities.
Last week, Mattewu Albence, a senior executive officer with the Financial Aid and Delivery Amendment, filed a complaint before the Convention that the agency held a large number of people applying for child support that was not involved.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have criminal reports.
"Over 80<0x25> of some people are supporters or family members who support this country illegally, and a large chunk of the victims of crime.
So we continue to protest against these people," Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to advance the children quickly, officials promise new laws that will require others to appear in court in a sealed month, shortly after 60 days, which is the best of the previous rules, in respect of residential workers.
Many will appear on the phone conference board, rather than on the person, to justify their case in the case of the immigration court.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be quickly removed.
After a long period of time, children may be able to stay on the screen, which may cause anxiety or stress, which can lead to a later period or worsening, according to the gestation staff and reports that have emerged from the program in the coming months.
Supporters say this concern has been raised in a large center such as Tornillo, where the child's symptoms are not as difficult as they can be forced, due to their size.
It also adds that transporting children to a tent town without having to provide enough time for physical preparation or to mean that friends can create a lot of damage they were experiencing.
Syria tells the U.S., French, and Turkey that it relies quickly
In response to the United Nations Convention, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to arrive at home, although the country's war is now the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as prime minister, says the Syrian foreign forces are illegally, under the sense of fighting violence, and "will be treated properly."
"They need to get rid of it quickly and without any restrictions," the congregation said.
Moualem stressed that "the war of the event is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions more people were displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight against this holy place until we finish the whole region of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 Syrian organizations, generally training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab organizations against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the world in a war-torn country
In the matter of the peasants, Moualem said the restrictions were ready to return, and he said that "other Western nations" because of the irresponsible fear that causes the fleeers to stay away.
"We've called the international community and community organizations to prepare for these payments," he said.
"They've got police to be a public concern."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The UN's coalitions say a recent agreement to move between Russia and Turkey to establish the tampon level of the Idlib archipelago has created an opportunity to advance the political talks.
The Russian-e-Turkey language attacked a massive Russian attack on the temple, where three million people lived.
Moualem but insisted that the agreement "has come a long time" and expressed the hope that the participation of the military will focus on the jihadists including the Al-<0x51>aeda-led fighters with the Nusra Front, "will be destroyed."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon bring together the first meetings of the new committee organized by government members and opposition to design the Syrian war constitution and delivering the option.
Moualem put conditions to hold the recommendation of the Syrian Government to the committee, which the panel's work should be held for "revision of current constitutional articles," and warned of interference.

Without money, there is a flood in the country's
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania sees a flood of expenditures, due to the conversion of debt that connects to the affected areas in the same seat.
A new district was destroyed in Pittsburgh's recently-democratic Rep.
The House is working against another authorized member, republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which carries the 17th most.
Maps were raised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were not subject to the Constitution in favour of the Republic.
The competition in the 17th new setbacks from the campaign for slalgfest among the major group fund, the Democratic Committee of the Central Committee (DCC) and the National Committee of the National People's Republic of Culture (NRCC).
The House became a common name in Pennsylvania after a small visit to a special guest on March 18 of the Central District in Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by the Republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political parties have given the Democratic nomination a little bit of a challenge.

Diplomats say that the Dominican Republic and Panama chose Beijing, not to leave Washington.
Mr. Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner released the Trump Organization's control group.
Government Department officials have decided to return U.S. delegates to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about "and recent resolutions to be destroyed soon to be able to see Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, who is representing the Department, which is on the mission this month.
But the verdicts were only drawn about El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million worth of American aid in 2017, including the management of drugs, development and economic support.
The planned penalties, which include the selection of funding and visa restrictions aimed at it, would be painful in the North-American country and the lack of high performance and death rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and North American officials dropped a high-profile conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a key step in preventing immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials explained that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any consideration of El Salvador's rulings.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now prepared to deal with the conferences, now launched in October, in a sign of importing control to the conference.
And the three Americans sent automatically to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without heavy messages or announcements from Washington.

Their reports were supported by an external analyst close to the administration and spoke of unknown circumstances.
The history of learning
The next paragraph to drop may be Robert Mueller's special counsel on Mr. Trump's report on the protection of righteousness, where there is much evidence in public information.
Mr. Mueller is said to have responded to his investigation even if Mr. Trump's campaign has joined Russia's attacks on our elections.
If Congress is going to change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing responsibility for the body, as he is ready to return before the voters, perhaps eventually becoming a judge of his peers.
That's a lot, and I don't like to show that Mr. Trump doesn't condemn - or can't be compared to Europe.
There is a choice to make our own on both sides of the Atlantic which will prevent how far a struggle can be achieved.
In 1938, German officers were ready to drive Hitler, only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and we have lost the opportunity to judge for years of murder.
The history curves around such points, and a democracy that can't be supported quickly or slow.
The U.S. is dealing with articles now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump shoots the Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controlled the Future of Inquiry by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper said, last year, he was secretly advised to write the president and explained improperly to the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was not correct.
"What are we going to respond when further investigations ask FB.I. Brett Kavanaugh's investigations are unconstitutional or relevant - or if you are confirmed in the Supreme Court and despite the sincere prosecution of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote among the Senators who will hold Mr. Trump?
If we win the test, the democracy will be a long winter.
But I believe that we will not lose, because of my studies in Prague.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans with Hope in front of Ripid Vienna
Rangers Rudid Vienna's squad on Thursday, being able to win the Austrians, after the Spanish pursuit against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in the correct position to qualify for the Europa League team.
The knee injury prevented the line between Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance of the season until it was 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers could use the result as a feat.
"It was a good idea for us because Villarreal is a good thing," said the 31-year-old boy.
"We went to the game and believed we were going to get something.
Maybe we can handle it at the end but, in general, the design is probably the right result.
They could be better at the top of the first and we went out in the second half and were good.
On Thursday, it is one of the biggest European destinations.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they have a good contribution to their final games but, with the next crowd, I'm sure we can get rid of them and have good results.
The past year was very difficult, between everything that happened and my injuries, and changes in the team, but there is a faelgood aspect about the place now.
The good of the club and the boys are very fond of it; the proper training.
We hope that we can push it now, put the last time behind us and win."

The search for land and tsunamis in Indonesia
A total of 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that attacked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say, the death expected to rise.
When possible communication, aid centers are unable to obtain information from the Donggala patient, the northern part of Palu near the 7.5-magnitude Earthquake epicenter.
In the Palu, more than 16,000 people were deported after the disaster strikes.
Here are some of the most important things about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, at the end of a small west coast stone on the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with the efforts of the earth and the tsunami.
Donggala regacy is easier than 300 kilometres (180 mi) of the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, the province's administrative area, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic features of the Central Sulawesi province, mainly the coast region of Dugalagala.
The nickel line is very important in the province, but especially it is concentrated in Morawali, on the small side of the Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been divided by tsunamis many years ago, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency's Indistri
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the Donggala side in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is based in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly attacked by earthquakes.
Here are a few of the major conferences and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large coastal summit on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Statra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people and the Indian Ocean, beyond their territory in Aceh.
2005: A list of powerful summits that take the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nias, along the coast of Satatra.
2006: 6.8 magnitude touching south of Java, an island in Indonesia, causing the tsunami to be cut off from the southern coast, killing an estimated 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-strong summit near the city of Padang, the capital city of the West-Tanethi.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-foot water summit struck one of the islands of Mentawayai, Sumatra, in which a tsunami of 10 to 100 meters of water killed 300 people.
2016 The Pidie Jaya Festival in Aceh, causing the destruction and disruption as people are reminded of the 2004 Earthquake and tsunami,
No tsunami was started at this time, but more than 100 buildings were killed.
2018: Large bombs attack the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The attempt destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son is tied to home development projects.
Palin's succession, Alaska's oldest son governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, is arrested for assaulting.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was convicted of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and anti-terrorism, according to a ceremony held on Saturday at the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police, when a well-known woman tried to call the police for details of the crime, she took her phone.
Palin has been delivered to the Matt-Su for the Prescriptional Facility and is held in a safe band for <0x24>500, which is reserved for KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he "would not be guilty" when asked for his request, he told the network.
Palin is also faced with the three plaintiffs of Section A, which means that he can be jailed for a year and pay <0x24>250,000.
Against Section B, payment of a day in prison and a fee of <0x24>2,000.
It's not the first time the criminal charges were paid in Palin.
In December 2017, he was arrested for beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to stop the assault.
The case is currently before the Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, disrupting the report of domestic violence, and had a weapon when he was sprayed about the incident.
His daughter was accused of ousting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veterans in 2016 after combining her son's medical behaviour in PTSD from her service in Iraq.

State prosecutors seek the death penalty for NYC's rare death
New York's Bushmen sought the death penalty for Stevelo Saikov, a New York City-based drone attack that killed eight people - an unusual threat that had not been made during a police crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, said that he used Loto Dotto to launch Home for an attack on a bike ride along the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, to charge pedestrians and bicycles on his way in October.
In order to be judged for the death penalty, the Bush administration will have to testify that Saipov "for the purpose" killed eight victims and "for the purpose" caused physical injury, following notice for the purpose of seeking death sentence, located in the Northern District of New York.
Both of them are responsible for the death penalty, according to the court.
A week after the attack, a grand jury struck Saipov with 22-count of accusation which included eight counts of murder in assisting loyalty, usually used by gangsters in cases of criminal cases, and charges of violence and destruction.
The attack had to be "a great deal of planning and editing," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "a cruel, cruel and true."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries, loss of family and friends of George Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, and Hen-Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, and Hernan Ferruchi.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the Northern District of New York has renewed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug providers but was eventually sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was held in the case of a New York case in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple was killed after they were found guilty of the Soviet Union robbery during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He said the investigators felt that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to conduct an attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the case.
He was asked to show the ISIS custody at his hospital, where the police said.
You've been guilty of cessation.
David Patton, one of the authorities representing Saviv, said that "in the face of terror" in the decision of the minister.
"We think the decision to get a death sentence instead of accepting a sentence in prison without any discharge increases the full-time participation of all those affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the hunters to seek the death penalty.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the world title after officials gave him Sebastian Vettel's victory.
It has been clear from the time Valtteri Bottas was eligible before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes "group orders will play a major role in the competition.
From the pole, the Bottas started the start and almost stopped Hamilton to dry as he secured his position in the first two things and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel entered the first innings and left Hamilton to run into a pack tail car, something he needed to make a decision.
Mercedes avoided the bag later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a certain sexual drive that saw the Ferrari driver leave unsafe at the risk of holding after a double walk defense in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the campaign on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the competition as he held on to his feet to focus quickly and take Kimi Raikkonen IV.
He finally entered the pits on page 44 but couldn't raise the momentum in the remaining eight places as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a nice job every week and she was a man who told me to let me go.
The team has done a unique job to have a second," said Hamilton.
"The team did a job that wouldn't break into second," said Hamilton.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the meetings on Saturday for his conscientious objection that he did not break the book from Christine Blasey Ford condemning Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
Speaking at the convention in West Virginia, the president did not explicitly declare the evidence presented by Feyi before the Board of Courts of Appeals, instead of focusing on what happened in the Senate indicates that the people were "speaking and refreshing and solid."
One thing that can happen and something good goes on for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and talking and weeping and not saying," he said.
"When you're looking for a leak and say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Don't you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you sick?
Remember the answer...what is it?
Oh no.
I didn't wake up."
Yes, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't go," he said.
Feinstein sent a letter writing about Kavanaugh by Fordon in July, and he lived at the beginning of September - but Feinstein was rarely able to leak from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's reports, I didn't end his story," Feinstein told the committee, Hull reported.
"He asked me to hold it privately and keep it secret as he asked me."
But his rejection did not seem to have a good standing with the president, who said during Saturday night: "I'll tell you that, that was very bad for the body.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst kind of body I've ever seen."
To advance to protect the Supreme Court, charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the president explained that Democrats are used for their judgments.
"They are committed to restoring power in any way needed.
He sees the meaning, the lack of transparency, who cares about who is doing the wrong, who should work to take control and control," Mediaite said.

Coronavirus: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a car crash.
Airline operating a plane that disrupted the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man was lost, after all 47 passengers and crew safely traveled on a plane.
Air Niugini said she was free to say that on Saturday afternoon, she couldn't respond to a man who was traveling with her.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find a man.
Airline did not respond quickly to requests for a lot of details about the victim, such as his time or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water while attempting to reach the Chuuk Island cruise line.
Police say on Friday that seven people were arrested in the hospital.
The plane said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
What led to confusion and direct succession of events is still easy.
The U.S. Airline and U.S. Navy both said it was approaching the shortest port of the route.
Some witnesses thought that the car was moving over the floor.
U.S. defender Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
That's fine," said Jaynes.

An analysis of the night star's worth of
The trial was held on Saturday in a man's retrieval of women from Mississippi living in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's Department of Corrections Paul Rowlett confirmed in just hours with technical evidence in the fields of information analysis.
He explained the order of how to use phone records to connect with 29-year-old <0x51>uinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received local data from multiple cellphones that showed that Tisis had Chambers on the evening of his death, opposing his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone had Chambers at some point with his friend Michael Sanford, the police would speak to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said at a Sanford rally that night, Sanford said that he "went asleep, because my truck went to Nashville."
One thing to note is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records show that they only know one week.
Rowlett said after Chambers' death, Cellis was removed from Chats Chambers, phone and contact information on his phone.
"She's got her face off," said Hale.
The defense is set to begin its closing talks on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be a judge later that day.

Is there a black man?!
New York and New York City after the shooting of the word "racial"
New York andny report a couple quoted after finding a wrong text from a pregnant mother as "another black man."
The couple argues that if they're a bully, they're a symbol of "suit" and "whispering."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she discovered that the new child's service provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't want to do that," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing his gaffe, "no worries" Plasco-Flaxman was dismissed by Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their nanny came out, which was African-American, did a bad job and instead of waiting for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid one day for work and returned home to Uber.
Now, Maurice corrects the couple for a return, and wants to report on <0x24>350 a day in 6 months, the gig that he lives in at the beginning, if there is no agreement.
"I want to show you, look, you don't do such things," he told the post on Friday, adding "I know you're wrong."
The couple responded to accusations of racism, saying that Mauriceâ€™s resignation was a reasonable thing to do, fearing that they could trust him after he had offended him.
"My wife sent me something I didn't like to talk.
He is not a nation.
"We're not racist," the husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Can you put your children in the hands of a man who has been quick, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby's?
come."
In contrast to the suit that he was "whispering," Plasco said his wife was just two months old if she had a child and was "hard".
"Will you follow such a person?
That's not the best thing to do," the investment bank added.
Although the case is still ongoing, the public court immediately looks at the couple quoted in the social media, bringing them their behavior and ideas to it.
The Paddington publishers feared that the students did not have contact with the speakers, a new book shows
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said: "It's hard to put on the shoes of a person who's reading for the first time before it's published.
I'm so surprised now we know about the great success in Paddington."
He said that his father, who worked as a BBC Cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book with a small label, would be a rare man about his raped work, added that 60 years of this book was "after his death last year."
In Paddington, which describes as "the most important member of the family," added his father who relied automatically on his success.
"He was an adult, and he was not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to him, it was difficult for him to have a child who does something: he is proud of himself even if not really.
I think he was watching Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and thought, he always gave him a vest to Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to sit on the phone.
Her daughter was then taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad repeatedly called it wrong, if he was not expected to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say that he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say to him.
And I did.
He said, "I love you so much, I love you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave him the ability to keep his heart beat quickly and leave his system.
He had lost his hand for a while, and it was all closed.
I just had to wait and wait, knowing that everything was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was placed in a situation surrounding families and people.
I had to hold them together."
In the end, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, sadly because of his daughter's loss, flew along with the other passengers - not realizing what the problem was.
"No one knows," he said.
"I touched my head, and the tears were all over.
It's hard to explain, but in this spirit I felt this kind of kindness to Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Women's rights to protect themselves from murder in the hospital
Two women who lost their loved ones to kill themselves try to protect others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge and encouraging messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when she began to suffer and kill her 18-year-old.
"I don't want any parent to hear how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45-year-old, who lives in Sydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious disease.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They always talked about her smile."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "place in darkness."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who could get his brother after he was already alive.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm always worried that there's going to be a knock on."
Mrs. Davis created cards, "to let people know that there are people outside where you can talk to them, even if you're a friend.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after Mother's death.
"It doesn't matter if he heard or suffered or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized his change in attitude.
She was in the middle of Christmas, when the children opened up their gifts she didn't have any electricity with them."
He said that his death was a big blow to them, but he had to work on it: "You're proud of the hole in the family.
We don't leave
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's morning is based on balance as the FBI begins research
"I thought, if we could find something similar to asking it - a timely, limited investigation into the space - maybe we bring in a small partnership," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee "a separation between the shared gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of time.
The election will last five weeks, on November 6 - that, as expected, the Republicans do wrong, so they will be very weak in their attempts to find a man who wants to be elected to the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush shares a phone call to call Senators, asking for support from Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for the Western House at Mr. W. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI has published its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
It is not clear that Mr Kavanaugh can reach up to 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will allow Mike Pence, the president, to break the bill and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defecators "down" under Kim
The number of North Korean authorities to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un has been strong seven years ago, said a South Korean representative said.
The Byeong-seug Park, which mentions data from Southern relations service, said that there was 1,127 security in the past year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the border control between North Korea and China and higher levels was paid by the developers of the main industry.
Pyongyang did not make public opinion.
Most of the survivors from the North are eventually given by the South Koreans.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have officially crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, the highest limit in North Korea and it is easy to cross beyond the Digitalized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China refers to those who act as illegal immigrants rather than runners and repeatedly recover them repeatedly.
The relationship between North and South America - which was legally active in the war - has been overly successful in the coming months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang with talks that focused on the discussions of the merger.
This came after a June history meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on a Korean peninsula without a nuclear.
But on Saturday, North Korea's President Ri Yong-ho says the U.S. sanctions for not taking a stand in progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will exploit it for the first time," said Mr Ri in a speech at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "a triangle," saying she is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court senior Brett Kavanaugh "a triangle" and said he could not serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made a response to a Saturday talk at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but I think if a woman ever did that way, they'd say that they would 'take advantage,' Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh testifying before the Courts Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was legally admitted to smoking sex with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the time of the opening, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and combining when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He clearly judged the Democrats in the committee, calling for the scandals of him a "universal link and man-made arrangement" organized by rare institutions that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 national election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's conviction that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he indicated that he was abused in the Democrats.
"I think you're looking for those definitions and how they follow the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was stressed when asked if he would try to interfere with Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or in the FBI, then he's not supposed to be a Supreme Court, but to be in court right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democracy he was concerned about the Kavanaugh Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a preservative justice.
Upon confirming his detention, Kavanaugh answered questions as to whether he could change the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a dangerous, private person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not that,'" said Pelosi.
Women want to protect it.
The good diatribe, the moon and the years of the burning of anger, and can't do it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Mr Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was a ruler somewhere, who also cried, but she produced a procedure that meant that when she took a bath and started crying, she said to someone she was talking to him, "You think I'm crazy because I cried.
I'm angry."
And he continued to walk.
I thought it was wise."
Tears are allowed as a result of anger because they do not understand well.
One of my more sharp memories than my first job, in a man-controlled office, where I found crying in an unexplored rage, was I caught by a scruff on my neck by an elderly woman - I'm always very scared - who's going to me on the screen.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"You don't know you're angry.
They think you're happy and you'll be happy to come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democraticwoman of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on her presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on a hunger outside the ship called the Monkey Business and left the challenge, Mrs. Schroeder, was very nervous, he could think that there was no reason to find the idea of running the president himself.
"There was no good decision," he said with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven candidates in the tournament, and the last thing they wanted was another.
One called it "the Snow White and the Seven Most Popular."
Because it was behind the campaign, it was behind the funding, and so he vowed not to enter the contest unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters offered <0x24>1,000 to men who would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech which informed us that he would not put an official campaign, he was emotionally frustrated - thanks to the people who had supported him, the frustration and the process that made it much more difficult to raise money and target voters than the delegates, and anger at the sexism - that he was resurrected.
"You think I'm going to be confused," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the printer reacted to him.
"You think Kleenex was my sponsor of the company.
Do you think I'm going to put it on my rock?
"You cry?"
How the U.S.-China War on Trade can be a good thing in Beijing
The salvos of opening the trade war between the U.S. and China were deaf, and while fighting was far away, conflict between countries could be useful for Beijing in a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by charging foreign Chinese talks including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A remarkable increase is being made this week with new payments that cost <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of things, effectively with the tax of all coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been recycled and recycled quickly, the tariffs have recently paid up to ten per cent for <0x24>60 million.
China has pledged to compare the U.S. short-shot, and the vast majority of the economy in the world is unlikely to merge anytime soon.
Finding Washington to return to the bottom means taking the requirements, but submitting to the United States will be very embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the U.S. military sanctions could certainly help China more than a long time by reducing foreign dependence.
"The fact that a recent political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the situation that begins to drop waste in the country is more dangerous than observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a research friend who is focusing on Asia, says the new American Security Center, a statement.
Syria's "prepared" for those who are fleeing to return, says the President of the United Nations
