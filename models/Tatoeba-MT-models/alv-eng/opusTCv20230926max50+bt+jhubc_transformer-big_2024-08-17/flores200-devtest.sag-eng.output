So they cut off the anchors and let them sink in the sea, and at the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars. Then they raised the sail at the front of the ship so that the wind would blow the ship forward, and we headed for shore.
Now there were quite a few lamps in the upstairs room where we were gathered.

In that way, the parts of the body will not take sides. All of them will take care of each other.
So they cut off the anchors and let them sink in the sea, and at the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars. Then they raised the sail at the front of the ship so that the wind would blow the ship forward, and we headed for shore.

Like the dirty foam on the wild waves in the sea, everyone can see the shameful things they do. They are like stars that wander in the sky. A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them forever.

The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory. His angels will come with him. And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done.
Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much earth covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.

And let them also be tried and investigated and proved first; then, if they turn out to be above reproach, let them serve [as deacons].
On top of the box were the shapes of two angels. They showed that God is great. Their wings spread over the cover of the box. It was the place where God showed that he is kind. But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now.
Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full - grown, gives birth to death.
