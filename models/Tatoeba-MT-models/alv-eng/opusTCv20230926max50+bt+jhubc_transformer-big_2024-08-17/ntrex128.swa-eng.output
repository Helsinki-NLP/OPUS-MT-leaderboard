Welsh Council delegates are concerned about 'like puppets'
There are concerns among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to MWP (the Welsh Parliamentary Commissioner).
This is due to a plan to change the name of the council to the Parliament of Wales.
Council delegates from all political ends are concerned that the move will lead to a sarcasm.
One Leba delegate said that his group was concerned that the name " corresponds to Twp and Pwp."
To readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means fool and pwp means feces.
Plaid's representative said that the group in general is "not happy" and has proposed an alternative name.
A conservative delegate said his group was "secure in thought" about the name change, but he said they were abbreviations of the MWP to the puppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Council panel, which is currently creating legislation to establish a name change, said: "The final decision regarding any basic term concerning how the Council Commissioners are referred to will actually be of the delegates themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act paid the Welsh Council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published the results of public consultations on proposals that were broadly supported in reference to the council as the Parliament of Wales.
In regards to the position of Council Commissioners, Jopo preferred the Welsh Parliamentary Commissioners or the WMP, but the MWP option received more support in public consultations.
What appears, Council Commissioners recommend alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a challenge for the Executive Officer, Elin Jones, orbye is expected to submit a legal draft on change after a few weeks.
Laws on change will include other changes on how the council works, including legislation to remove the merits of the Commissioner of the Council and the structure of the board system.
Council delegates will vote last on the name they will be called when they are discussing the law.
The Macedonians will vote on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country name to "North Macedonia."
This popular vote was planned to resolve a dispute that has existed for a decade with a neighboring Greek country, which has a province called Macedonia.
Authorities in Athens maintain that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim to their territory and have continued to oppose its request to be a member of the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of a direct referendum on change of name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of name is needed so that they can join the European Union and the NATO Union.
The bells of St. Martin Go Silent as Churches in Harlem review Chagamoto
"History, the elders I have raised and they say that there was a church and a bar in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, none."
He said the absence of a bar is understandable.
"People stagger in different ways" these days, he said.
"They're reluctant to be like a neighbor's lobby where people meet from time to time."
On the part of the churches, he is concerned that the money available from selling property will not last the project the leaders expect also, "and soon will return to their original state."
Churches, he added, may be converted into large mansions with private houses that will not help to maintain the remaining reserves in the surrounding area.
"The large number of people who buy private houses in these canvass will be white," he said, "and so this situation will be worth the closure of these churches as a whole because there is no possibility that people in these golfers will be partners of these churches."
Both churches were built by white collaborators before Harlem became the city of blacks - City Community in 1870 and named St. Martin a decade later.
Native Methodist members who were white left in the 1930s.
Members who were black who were participating in the surrounding area took the canvas.
St. Martin became under black partners under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the strike of retailers at 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or collaborate with black people.
The fire that occurred in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when partners in the Priest Johnson church put plans to rebuild it, they authorized the establishment of a set of bells played using a keyboard or a mechanical method.
The priest David Johnson, son of the priest Johnson and heiress of St. Martin, called the set of bells "the bells of the poor."
A specialist who played a bell set in July called it another name: "The cultural treasure" and "a historically indistinguishable one."
Professional, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the world's first set of bells that were played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the region of the largest set in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not look for someone else to take his place.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin for the past several months have been played by architects and contractors by means of tatanishi, some of which were brought in by church leaders, and others by the diocese of Uasko.
The council - administrative authority in the parish, comprising church administrators - wrote to the diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some associates complained of absence and transparency from the diocese.
Pope injures a 13-year-old child while diving to pick up a rope-tree in California
The Pope later attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to train a rope-tree in Carlifonia on the first day of the rope-tree season, officials said.
The raid occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a young man screaming calling for help and then rowed with the group to help him sink.
Hammel said that the first time he thought it was just the excitement of harnessing the rope-tree, but "I found out that he was screaming, 'I've been bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His shoulder bone had come out," Hammel said he discovered it after he approached a boy.
"I shouted for everybody to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
Boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed as in critical condition.
The species of shark who made the invasion is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a session with reporters that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was noted that it is not a endangered shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries at the top of his two.
Officials closed shore access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using a range of beauty styles with staff who are assistant professionals.
As much of the planning to enter the beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home equipment decline, large beauty columns will be tested in 11 stores across the country and established in more stores next year if this move is successful.
The investment in beauty has been repeated as supermarkets looking for techniques to fill shelf spaces that were used to set up televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the delivery of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweederman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing editions from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with places set up similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket is also rebranding the Shop of various cosmetic products so that most of the products provide services to people who do not eat meat - which is strongly pressured by young buyers.
Moreover, the luxury retailer Fragrance Shop will experiment in two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and consumer preferences for everyday food products to a small extent in a nearby retail store means supermarkets have to make more effort to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive at Sainsbury, has said that stores will have more visibility as units stores while a chain of supermarkets attempting to deal with Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been starting small Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also established some Habitats stores from the time it bought the two mills two years ago, which says it has increased the sales of vegetables and made the customer service more profitable.
The original attempt by the supermarket to revive its beauty units and the drug attacked empty.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger collapsed after a dispute arose about how to divide revenue from the pharmacy in its supermarkets.
A new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury sold its 281st store console business to Celestio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to have contributed to the plan, by adding more high-quality brands of face care and skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and condition of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also invested in professional staff that will be available for advice.
Our various editions have been designed to meet all the needs and the environment that are attractive and the right place means that we have now become an exciting place for beauty products where it offers great competition for the original ways of making the purchase."
Peter Jones 'injury' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business plan
Dragons' star Den, Peter Jones was left 'explored' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his live brand business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have enough time for their Truly brand of domestic products and spares.
The business of the two was connected to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
A 37-year-old presenter of This Morning, wrote on Instagram to announce that he is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons star" Den Peter Jones upset by withdrawing from their luxury brand of live-action formats at the last minute – to focus on his new superhero contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "extremely upset" when the popular girl in television admitted at a troubled meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business plans - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant that she would not have enough time to handle their home supplies and supplies.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to increase Willoughby's fortune twice estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, wrote on Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly's business, Jones left England on a flight to one of his vacation homes.
The source of information said: "Truly was among the things that Holly considered most.
It was to be his permanent future that would allow him to continue for over the next several decades.
His decision to withdraw was surprising to everyone involved.
No one believed what was going on Tuesday, the time of the launch had come close.
There are warehouses full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this presenter of This Morning, who is all of the most reliable in the United Kingdom, can cost the business millions of dollars from major investments in products including rivers, candles, textiles and household equipment and the possibility of delay in launch.
And it can indicate the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and his brother Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple goes on vacation with Jones who owns 40<0x25> in Baldwin's Running Factory.
Willoughby is expected to be an M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity Show.
A news source near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his controversial activities."
A solid conversation 'and then we love each other'
He joked about criticisms that he would get from news agencies by commenting on which others would consider to be "unfit to the president" and praised the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump more desperate?
Trump said in a sarcastic voice of "the newscaster".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June praised by Trump as a major step in removing nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament talks are stuck.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's renowned ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. The UN General Assembly Saturday that the nation of North Korea has not seen "equal action" from the United States for the early stages of disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has promoted sanctions that are aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump had a hopeful attitude in his speech at a public meeting.
"We are going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we've established a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim have resulted in good results - threatening rocket tests, assisting in the release of hostages and helping in the home repatriation of American troops.
And he defended his unusual way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, stretching the finger to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Indonesia Bringing Big Damage to Island, Killing Hundreds of People
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were unnecessary.
Even though more than 10<0x25> of Lombok's population had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a condition necessary to stimulate international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've become very clear that they don't ask for international assistance, and that's a challenge". Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children stalling a team to travel to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign workers can work between the area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster organization, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Due to frequent land vibrations that occur in Indonesia, the hio country has remained in a state of poor alignment due to natural disasters.
Although residential shelters due to the tsunami impact have been built in Aceh, they are not widely found in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning existed, may have contributed to the disaster.
In the best case, travelling between most Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make transport operations complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used the decentralized infrastructure in Indonesia as the core of your electoral campaigns, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail construction.
But the financial deficit has been a challenge for Mr. Joko's government as he approaches the election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from segregation groups, where many Muslim allies have had a conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of details were evacuated to their homes when groups of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, condemning swords, bows and arrows and other hostile weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks a hard equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League match against Chelsea by closing in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's entrance while his team was behind with a 1–0 lead.
He moved the ball to the left foot before raising the catcher to the top edge of the gate.
The shaft ascended over the defensive area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over the flying Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"It was just trying to be in the position the hi, to reach the ball and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as they can, so I tried to make myself as long as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming up and I took one touch and I didn't even think so much about it and I just hit the shorts."
Chelsea led 1–0 during the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The attacker of The Blues beat the heel without returning it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before spinning in the center of the field and running in the Liverpool gate side.
Kovacic gave the passport to another player and rotated the opponent and received it in the center of the field.
He then struck a mask that enabled Hazard to head into the box.
Hazard accelerated the defenders and tied the scoreboard at the opposite end of the gate with a left foot short against Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool become acquainted with Napoli in the group matches of the Champions League at 9pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea become acquainted with Videoton in the Europa League at 9pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Many people were reported stranded in rubble of buildings damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a meeting with reporters.
The town of Palu, which has over 380,000 people, was filled with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, aged 32, on alleged murder after a woman stabbed and killed
A murder investigation has been established after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning to wake up today.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 1.55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for alleged murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to appear.
Detective Superintendent Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything he doubted to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, specifically taxi drivers, who may have trapped anything with their car cameras in contact with us because they may have an explanation that is important to the investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed that a woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
This afternoon friends who believe they know a woman have arrived in the scene to ask questions about her whereabouts this morning.
The investigation continues and police have said that they are in the process of informing the family members of the moniker.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has now attempted to enter his house but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He had no say when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it can take several hours before being allowed into the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up in the area crying.
He continues to repeat the words 'very annoying'.
At 8 p.m. police cars were inside the building and the other car was out.
Several officers stood in the apartments and pursued the ghorofa flags.
Anyone with information is asked to send a personal message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers team without identifying themselves via 0800 555 111 and refer to the 247 record of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes a recent scapegoat to face the crisis of 'registration history'
His removal will be a meritorious justice for his destruction similar to the Taliban for the many religious and cultural art of Britain carried out by his staunch Puritan allies.
But the Community of Cromwell described Mr. Crick's proposal as "apologetic" and "to answer rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It would not be avoided in the current debate regarding the removal of statues as an example of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying symbols in the civil war in England was neither awakened nor enforced by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst that Cromwell would have been blamed for is the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the last century.
The impressive representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is evidence of 19th century views and part of the history of a man who many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is revered by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary advocate due to external pressure, a situation in which it was a source of royal leadership.
Whether this is all a proper representation in the topic of an ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the war in the mid-17th century has laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a self-identified individual to represent one in the opposition groups.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and observance."
Pig Killer Amng'ata and Killing Chinese Farmer
Farmer was raided and killed by pigs in the south-western China market, according to media reports in the area.
The man, identified by the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with a badly damaged vein lying in blood near a pig hut in the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give vaccines to pigs in a guinea pig room on May 20, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of <0x51>inghai, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door to the neighboring pig hut was open.
He said that there was a male pig in his mouth.
An investigation confirmed that the <0xC2><0xA3>550 pound pig had ripped off and killed the farmer, according to a report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and broken," a cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," he said, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving on the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked off to prevent her from raping someone else, while police collected evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market crocodiles are reported to have discussed his death.
Although it does not occur frequently, the conditions of pigs in the invasion of humans have been recorded previously.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3>650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the lady shocked him and fled.
After a farmer in Oregon was settled by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but bleeding can be a "provocative."
"They're just playing.
They smell, and those who want to know ... have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bringing heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over more static waters on the north coast of Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa, however, will bring flood rains throughout northern Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a winds of 85 mph, Hurricane Type 1, at 11 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
At this time, the atmospheric pressure has begun to dissipate over the Pacific Ocean and head eastward toward the West Coast of the United States, with Hurricane Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push the tropical moist to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, the tropical moisture that begins to interact with the nearby atmosphere pressure will cause much rain in the South west in the future.
In inland areas, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause sudden flooding, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to range from 2 to 3 inches per hour per hour in one place, specialising in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be rain levels of 2 to 4 inches in southwest parts, covering most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur due to ongoing poor conditions due to tropical rain conditions.
It will be extremely dangerous to go out into the desert by foot due to the risk of tropical rain.
Most of the rain can cause slits to become large rivers and thunderstorms will bring a strong wind and a dust that is scattered.
The approaching climate zone will bring heavy rainfall to some of the Southern California coastal areas.
The total rainfall rates of more than half an inch may occur, which may result in a small drop of mud and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the area in the rainy season.
Some of the upcoming tropical rain floods will begin heading to Arizona areas later on Sunday and Monday morning, before rain spreads further later Monday and Tuesday.
Most of the rain will spread in the Four Horns on Tuesday to Wednesday.
October may have a temperature change across the United States as the Arctic temperature decreases, but areas in the tropics will remain temperate.
This sometimes causes sudden temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of sudden differences in temperature throughout the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There is about 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the approaching summer heat will try to collect and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern areas of the United States are expected to be warm at the beginning of October and spread to 80 degrees from the South Plains regions to the North West.
Temperatures in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term forecasts show a greater likelihood of temperatures than average in the eastern United States to half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's case
More than 20 million people watched extensive evidence on Thursday by Supreme Court selection Brett Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual abuse that is said to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular sessions to mark the final stage of Friday's events: an agreement implemented by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he is 100<0x25> sure that Kavanaugh held him in secret when he was drunk and tried to strip him at the school's Sunday ceremony.
Kavanaugh, providing emotional testimony, said he is 100<0x25> confident that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company was counting the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Statistics were not immediately available from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's organization usually has the challenge of counting people who are watching in office.
In order to keep this in the right perspective, the hio is an audience equal to the viewers of a professional soccer game or the Academy of Studies.
Fox News, whose programming executives have been strongly supported by Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day's hiatus, Nielsen said.
ABC station was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Ham remained on top after the trial.
Flake was the main theme in Friday's hearing.
After this moderate Republican officer reported that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras in the morning on Friday with protesters as he was trying to climb the elevator to attend the Court Committee case.
He stood down for several minutes while being reprimanded, an incident shown live on CNN.
"I've stood here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You're strong when most women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had reported and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have had much to say in a committee case.
The broadcasting and cable networks were all airing straight hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do it with the understanding that the FBI could investigate allegations against the appointee in the next week, which a few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was persuaded to some extent by a conversation with his friend, the Democrat Senator. Chris Coons.
After talks with the Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has filed an investigation through the FBI about allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May has denounced opponents for 'playing politics' in connection with Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to withdraw from the European Union for "suspending politics" and the British's future and to denounce national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview near him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign affairs minister Boris Johnson insisted his attacks on his plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect the tribute of each other is "a nonsense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of the 20-year-old Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for the second degree of murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.
Police found glasses from the attack site and said they found Simpson's DNA on glasses, WAFB station, a CBS associate, said.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His trust is set to be <0xC2><0xA3>350,000, the Attorney reported.
An office investigator for the deaths of East Baton Rouge gave the original report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head inside the neck.
The department congratulates the Louisiana State Police panel, a police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in an investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authority for "a demand and fair enforcement."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-inch attacker was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "very affected" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"Some things like this are the ones that keep a person nervous all the time," Wade said.
Volcano hurls ashes over Mexico City
The thunderstorms launched from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached neighboring areas of the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after operations increased inside the crater and recorded 183 times of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
This station was following many thunderstorms and vibrations.
Social media images showed thin ash ash covering traffic mirrors in neighboring Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in activity in the volcano which is located 45 kilometres (720 mi) south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred in mid-September 2017.
A volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatist protesters prior to the celebration of freedom of vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-democracy protesters clashed with protest police as thousands joined the opposition protests to mark the first year of the Katalunya separatist vote.
A group of demonstrators wearing puppets who support isolation from police hit them with eggs and threw them into powder paint, resulting in black dust clouds on the street that would normally have many tourists.
Riots also later that day as police used their rods to face clashes.
For more than a couple of hours the pro-communist groups saying "No to forget, no pardon" faced the unionist protesters saying, "Uhispiania always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries found in the protest, local media reported.
Concerns have remained high in the area preferring to gain independence a year after a 1 October referendum was considered illegal by authorities in Madrid but celebrated by separatists.
Voters chose mostly to gain independence, although the number of people who showed up as low as those opposed to segregation ignored voting significantly.
According to the Catalan authorities around 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region and caused serious riots.
Liberal groups had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to help national police.
The march continued but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist march and his wife said he was no longer optimistic of Katalunya's prospects for independence.
"In the past year we got to live in the best of life.
I watched my parents cry happily for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite gaining significant victories despite being too small in the previous regional elections in December, the Liberal Party has failed to maintain momentum this year while many of the most prominent leaders are in exile by the desire or detention pending trial for providing a referendum and a later statement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic recording protests supporting police on her phone, said the conflict had been caused by politicians from both levels.
"The concerns continue to increase further," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the pre-trial jail since late last year, announced that he would run for a seat in the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European Parliament's election is the best way to refuse the restoration of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The bow may also have been fired by a car at some point.
Menga's bat gives Livingston a 1–0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first pitcher for Livingston ensured victory
elevated Livingston surprised Rangers by resulting in Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the club's Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's tie split the result between both teams as Gary Holt's team moved and held second place equal to Hibernian.
The Gerrard team remains undefeated in foreign matches in the Premier League this season and will face leaders Hearts, who are ahead of them by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will be the Rapid Vienna native to the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased the number of matches that have not been able to be six in the bridge, where head coach Holt has not yet been defeated since taking over Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a spot against the unbeaten visitors
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before shutting down, with their automatic attack game causing Rangers problems of all kinds.
Scott Robinson was able to score but missed a goal for his scraper passed ahead of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after penetrating to meet the head ball from Craig Halkett.
Locals did not appear nervous and allowed Rangers to own a game, knowing that they could trouble visitors with a catapult.
And it was that way where they were able to tie the goal.
The Rangers were penalised for a tie and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up and gave Menga a chance, who touched and tied the bar from the middle of the box.
At the time, the Rangers had controlled the possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defensive line and gate guard Liam Kelly would not be challenged for a long period of play,
The style continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his wand.
Scott Pittman was prevented from closing the score with Rangers' gate guard Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed the ball out after another Livingston-based bowl game.
Attacks continued to catch Livingston's team kit and continued to be eliminated, while two penalti-after Halkett charges a saver Glenn Middleton, and the other in relation to holding the ball manually - were ignored.
'The Wonder' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont's BBC Scotland profile at Tony Macaroni's
The wonderful work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had a better game and continue to exceed expectations and continue to climb on the table.
Their style of playing with the team has not changed significantly since returning to the major leagues, but many compliments go to Holt in a way that he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed large, well-maintained the defensive fort with a better alignment, while Menga gave them regular operations to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
The Rangers missed a draw, however.
As they have been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under such standards.
They missed the final touch in the gate - only once they were able to create a chance to score in the home team's stronghold - and the hihi is a challenge to the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets reception with a different feeling in Cologne
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan Germany's controversial visit - which aims to reform relations between the two NATO allies.
They have differed in issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish access to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new big mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a barrier for a crowd of 25,000 not to collect in front of a mosque, but many supporters came up in nearby areas to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The two-level demonstrations point to a division about the presidential view who appears as a hero to some German Turks and is endorsed by others as a dictator.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collapsing with a car
A biker has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 4:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and emergency attendants arrived but the man died in the scene.
Destiny occurs several months after another cyclist died in a hit and escaped on Childers Road, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
City Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Restrictions on road closures and diverting buses to others have been imposed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison : six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's jail, the Jela Office has said.
A riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 3:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
Experts "Tornado" have been brought up to deal with the riot, which involves eight inmates and has been proven in one prison influence.
The officers were treated as a result of minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Jela Service said: "The staff with professional prison training have been brought in to cope with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated with minor injuries.
We don't support violence in our prison and it's clear that those involved will be sent to police and they can be added more time to the prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year protest officials were called into prison to face a major disruption in which workers were attacked with table gambling balls.
Hurricane Rosa Dangerous Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Ghafla Floods (A Summer Area Can Benefit)
It is not uncommon for tropical depressions to occur in Arizona, but that is exactly what can happen early next week when the remaining powers of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Western Desert and cause the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has described on the tweet that "10 tropical encyclopedias have maintained storms and a state of pressure shortages within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as a few levels of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Western Desert including the Great Basin Rockies are likely to get 1 to 2 inches and likely to get a few levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flooding, hurricane Rosa may be a blessing because the area is arid.
Despite flooding, some of these precipitations may be beneficial because the South West regions witness dry conditions.
According to the U.S. Climate Monitoring. just over 40<0x25> of Arizona is experiencing at least severe droughts, the second highest type," weather.com reported.
Firstly, Hurricane Rosa's route leads to land through the Pacific Basin of Baja California.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning and a maximum height of 85 miles per hour, is found 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heads north for 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing static water in the Pacific and hence its strength is reduced.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm strength during the day or on Monday evening.
Rain in some parts of Mexico can be large and cause a major flood risk.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to Sonora northwest and likely to reach 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Rosa then heads north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression and then heading up through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the Northwest Sonora Desert and U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
Rain is expected to cause sudden life-threatening flooding and mudflow in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four people who attempted to execute murder
Three teens of a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace at Midsomer Norton, at 10:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he has been hospitalized in a "strong state".
A 17-year-old boy, 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon Police and Somerset said.
Officials have asked anyone who may have captured an event with a mobile phone to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'was portrayed, jealous and angry' by the Democrats
"The election of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and threatening tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a Wheeling conference, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "excited and angry" by the Democrat Party during his entire selection process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally rejecting allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were young.
Ford also testified in a case about the woman's allegations.
The President said Saturday that "the people of America saw the intelligence and excellence and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The voting to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most comprehensive intelligences of our times, a lawyer with a good record of service to the public," he told the West Virginia crowd.
The President referred to Kavanaugh's indirect selection when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters emerging to vote in the representative election.
"Five weeks from now one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running for it, but from another perspective I'm really running for it," he said.
"That's what I'm going around everywhere to blow up the debe good candidates."
Trump said that democrats are willing to "anticipate and prevent."
The first significant legislative vote in the Senate over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held before Friday, the GOP's primary leadership assistant has told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many were read when heavy waves reached the beach, while a major earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a ceremony on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when six-foot (18 m) waves hit the dry land at night and shouted many and destroyed and destroyed everything that existed.
Tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their operations on the coast and did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency BNPB said at a meeting with reporters in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come to its sole end, it came to be bombarded with cars, logs, houses, affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had served on the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Other people planted trees to avoid tsunamis and saved themselves, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palau.
Air photos from the disaster organization showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges were overturned and drowned by a water-filled mosque.
Small vibrations continued to be heard in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Testing and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by a major earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times powered compared to an atomic bomb detonated by Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, which is found at the end of a narrow gap may have caused an increase in tsunami, said.
Nugroho described the state of destruction as "mina" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
.The bodies of some victims were found trapped in rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may be the largest along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, the area known as Donggala , which is near the core of the earthquake.
Communication was "completely disabled without any information" from Donggala , Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that workers and volunteers were heading to affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it can be worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for notifying that the tsunami had attacked Palu , although leaders said the waves arrived shortly after the warning was issued.
In a non-technical video shared in social media, a man in the upper floor of the building can be heard yelling at the impending tsunami warning to people on the street.
Within minutes the tide reaches the coast and carries buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to verify this video immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis led to the loss of power in a broader area that disrupted communications near Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes and supplies from Jakarta and other towns, authorities said, but evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The town's airport has only been opened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue stations in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami Rises Over 800.
The Situation Is So Bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala have been safely successful in the town of Palu, where workers are sheltering themselves in tents placed outside their office, they went through incidents of major damage along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many damaged houses" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though aid groups began charitable activities, some complained that the more detailed foreign workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, equipment and personnel from abroad can only begin to enter if the disaster declares national.
That's not done yet.
"It's still a regional scale disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international support but there is still no such situation."
On the second night when the city of Palu fell into disrepair after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the lost had hoped that their loved ones would play and make it a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found from a wastewater pump.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under rubble for two days and her mother's body near him.
Gendon Subandono , coach of the Indonesian national umbrella team, had taught two of the umbrella players who have been lost for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, together Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of umbrella jumping, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon described how, hours after reports about the Roa Roa Hotel spread between the community of participants in the umbrella jumping game, he had sent a WhatsApp message to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in a beach concert.
His message, however, featured a single gray track, rather than two blue tracks.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.

Kanye West: A die artist changes his name to Ye
The striker Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been temporarily nicknamed Ye and used the title as the title of her eighth album, published in June.
This change takes place before his appearance in the Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who she boasted for "motional reasons ," the show's producer said.
Although the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said previously that the term has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'he' is a widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' West said earlier this year, referring to the name of his album by radio producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means special, and only to be Ye - to be an example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than an example of how we are."
He's one of the famous flickers who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his privileges with the names Love and Brothers Love.
A former West member, JAY-Z, has also been forced to use its name with a lower or less recognizable character.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the army against civilians as the country is about to mark the 50th anniversary of the massacre with a high blood spill against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "one would not use the army to deal with the Mexicans."
The troops shot in a peaceful demonstration in the building on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people while the movement of left-wing students was rooting in the South American countries.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing a monthly day-to-day ban for students and opening unsigned public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double A.I. sponsorship.
As China continues to be more involved in creative intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it is spent in research in the field of hio, said the investor and expert of AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Opinion comes after various U.S. government units offer ads about AI, even though the United States generally lacks the official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and aims to be number 1 in the AI discovery by 2030.
"To double the AI budget will be a good start, due to the situation that all other countries are backward than the United States and we are looking for new innovations in the AI," Lee said.
Adding double money could double the opportunity that AI's biggest next success will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face <0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed the AI system that won the U.S. high-class Othello player and later became active in Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch of China.
Lee agreed that the U.S. government's original technology competition as of the Robotics Corporation in the Deep Defense Research Plans and asked to know when the next contest would be, to help identify prospective professionals.
Researchers in the United States often have to work overtime to get government aid, Lee said.
"It's not China taking professional leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the AI.
"I think green cards should be presented directly to PhD students in AI," he said.
The Chinese Country Committee released its Development Plan in Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China funds people in educational institutions similar to how the Foundations of Natural Sciences and other government agencies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of professional work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Collaboration in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from the sectors and scholars and the White House announced the creation of the Board of Investigation in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in a deal called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently offers more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that sought to form the National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence has not moved for several months now.
Macedonian voters vote on change of country name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday about the change of its name to the "North Macedonia Republic," a move which could resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that restricts its membership request to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim to its province and has opposed the request of the country as a member of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June in accordance with the proposed new name, but national opponents say the change will transform the ethnic recognition of many Slavic peoples in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and a campaign to ignore the vote has caused doubts about whether the number of voters will reach the 50<0x25> threshold required by the referendum to be correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO's membership with the EU and agree to an agreement with Greece."
Followers of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is an appropriate bailout to be paid for to be allowed into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries formed from Yugoslavia's dissolution.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because the move means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognized, enough members of the legislature have said they will support the outcome of the vote to make it more serious.
The name change will require support and two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission has said that there have not been any reports of violations by 7pm.
However, the voter turnout was only 16<0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the previous parliamentary election in 2016 while 66<0x25> of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Macedonia to change the country's name to a move that will open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was hosting a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in love, not through the back door with pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our honor.
If they don't want to register us like Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian cooperation."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO's membership will bring the most needed investment to Macedonia, which has a 20<0x25> unemployment rate.
"I believe the majority will support because 80<0x25> of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that the "yes" effect would be "evidence of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said between 30 and 43<0x25> of the voters will participate in a referendum - below the level needed .
Another study, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV , found that 57<0x25> of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70<0x25> said they will vote yes.
In order for a referendum to pursue a majority of voters it should be 50<0x25> and one vote.
Failure in the referendum will represent the first major blow to the Western government's policy of independence since it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City surrounds Brighton's entire fort and closes their
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fouled Brighton's keeper in a match that Manchester City won 2–0 Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very easy when he tied the score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker found a passport in the center of the field and started a series.
He passed between Brighton's three bets, before penetrating into the open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one bet and then accelerated the other on the edge of Brighton's gate box.
He then batted in his left side, and found Sterling.
The British striker used his touch first in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot around the defender of Brighton Mathew Ryan's gate and a pawn inside the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he closed their bao at the time."
But it is Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first control in the Premier League match.
The score was tied in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball inside Brighton in the attack.
He scored a good free kick through the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched her a few times before giving her a passport to Sterling on the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball inside the net before beginning to celebrate.
City are battling against Hoffenheim in a match for the Mabingw League teams at 6:55pm Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a villain against. Rockies
With the Nationals already eliminated from the playoffs, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But the most competitive Scherzers sends them into a shutout on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still serious harms in the relegation to the Rockies, who are proud of having one game they haven't played against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies won the title to play the match-off by winning 5–2 against the National on Friday night, but are still looking for the first crown in the bridge.
"Although we don't force us to get anything, at least we can play a tough game in terms of the situation it's going to be here in Denver and the crowd and the other hi team will be playing at the highest level at every level I'm going to face this year .
Why would I not want to compete at that level?"
The National has not yet announced players who will start the game on Sunday, but say they have liked to let Scherzer burn the ball in the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, practiced hurling on Thursday and will be airing on his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed batsman has 18–7 with an average of 2.53 innings and 300 points for a touchdown in 220 2<0x2F>3 innings this season.
Trump holds meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation facing his elected Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of Republican sons to the majority in the election of representatives.
"All the successes we got are in danger in November.
Five weeks from the most important election in our lives.
These are one of the great, great -- I am not running for it but for another view I actually run for it and that's why I'm around to beat the debe good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, very frightening group of Democrats, you see what they do right now.
And they have decided to take power with any possible means, you can see envy, depravity.
They don't care about people who are hurting, who are wrong with him for power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, the Democrats are willing to "anticipate and prevent."
"And you can see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats to be people of "terrorism and what they are and devious and false."
He cited a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who is Dianne Feinstein's name, which led to the audience stalling him.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you expose the document in a negative way?
Uh, uh, what's it.
No, not, I waited for one - that was a very weak body language - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Leba Society is no longer a church.
Don't tolerate free thought
When Momentum activists in my area party voted to remove me, it wasn't so strange.
After all, I'm one in the line of Leba MPs to be told that we don't want to - all by saying our thoughts.
A fellow in the legislature Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he stood for his rebellion against Judaism.
In my case, the proposal to remove me shocked me by disagreements with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of an appropriate economic policy, regarding national security, about the European issue, the problem is that the issues are similar to those that Jeremy differs from the previous leaders.
A statement to the Leba meeting in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want meetings to be both active and effective."
For more than eight years as a local Leba MP, Friday night GC meetings have been integrating this entirely.
Unfortunately today, it did not resemble many meetings and the promise of politics "slow, generous" has long been forgotten if, indeed, it had begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not accepted in the Leba party and all views are taken as well if only acceptable to party leadership.
this began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a fellow who I was thinking we share the same political attitude he began to expect me to change ideas completely and take positions that I would never agree with — whether it is about national security or one market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly—and it doesn't matter what I'm saying—what follows is an insult in social media and an effort to want me not to be elected, reject the politics of centralism, and tell me that I shouldn't be in the party of Leba.
And it's not the situation that I've passed alone.
Certainly, I know I'm more lucky than my colleagues because the opinions directed to me are political.
I respect the skills and statements of my colleagues who are faced with sexual insults or color every day but never give up.
One of the most frustrating things in modern politics is how the levels of abuse are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba should promote the culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer the church live and for every discussion of the solstice "lack of faith" or changes in the rules of selection, the party becomes the narrowest in integration.
I've got a lot of advice over the past two years if I'm encouraged to settle down, I'm not going to talk too much and that "I'll be okay."
But I didn't enter politics to do that.
Since I joined the Leba party 32 years ago as a school student, due to the motivation to be ignored by the Thatcher government which left my full school class almost collapsed, I have strived to fight for better public services for those who need them more — whether it be a local councillor or a government minister.
I haven't hidden the kind of my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham was able to be confused about attitudes in policies and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who brought forward a debate on Friday, all I'll say is that when the country is about to leave the European Union alma mater Brexit, a move that will hurt our family, business and public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and strength to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Leba party.
But really one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for citizens in my area, whether members of the Leba or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that there is no amount of threats to dispose of or political correctness that will prevent me from considering what I believe is for the best interest for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's uncredited team still takes first place on the table
Two attempts in the final may have changed at some point the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr qualified for this highly anticipated Tennent League match.
They now lead the table, the only team that has not been defeated.
Eventually, it was their best defence , as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and yet we haven't failed, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thank you Ayr, they used their best opportunity to invite us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, tied by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish player Rory Hughes, offered for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have multiple players and Jason Baggot scored an untying try.
Climi added Ayr's lead to the penalti, just before the break, scored and then completed the try alone and made the score 17–5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half with an attempt by Patrick Anderson, tied by Baggot, reducing the lead by five points.
The game was then temporarily suspended after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed carrying the game when it was restarted, Ayr added his lead to Stafford McDowall's attempt, tied by Climo.
Kaimu captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose used the chance to have one more player and tied for a try by Bruce Colvine , the end of the intense period.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card by playing for Climo without a ball and from the penal line out, MacPherson scored from a strong attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, how he was doing after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's scrap and kicked Gregor Henry and scored a fifth try for the home team.
The Star of the Still Game takes up a new job in the restaurant sector
The Star of the Still Game Ford Kieran is seen entering the housing sector after it was discovered that he has been appointed as director of a certified restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays under the name Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he is the author and co-star of his long-time collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the show and Kiernan apparently has another plan in life after Craiglang .
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper alleged that Kiernan was expecting to be involved in "a very growing restaurant business "in Glasgow."
'The port is ours': Bolivia that has no port hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The crew patrols at sea headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have dried the blue flag like the sea.
Marine stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have been spelled out: "The sea is our right.
To return it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without port, the memory of the coastal zone that lost it to Chile in the 19th century's resource crisis is still clear – just like the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps the hopes are now the highest for many years, with Bolivia awaiting the decision of an international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has speed, unity and calm spirit and really has the prospect of a positive attitude effectively," said Roberto Calzadilla , Bolivian diplomat.
Most Bolivians will look at the ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, claiming that the court in The Hague will give a decision that accepts Bolivia's claims - after several decades of appropriate talks - Chile will be forced to discuss the move to give Bolivia a way to reach the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who faces severe confrontations in re-election next year - also has much to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But other critics believe that there is little chance that the court will give the right decision for Bolivia - and that there will be very little change even if it decides that way.
The Dutch-based agency has no authority to dispose of Chile's territory for other countries, and has said that it cannot determine the outcome of the expected talks.
The decision of the ICJ will only be released six months after the final debate suggests that the case "is not a tatany," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate , a Chilean expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's hopes, four years ago it may have brought it back.
"The issue of maritimeisation is being exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate .
Morales' political words have ended Chile's remaining good intentions, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue the conversation, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomats since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9> , a Bolivian representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decisions were very fast.
Monday will give Bolivia a "wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the position "to end 139 years of diversity for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in the South America - was using the maritime issue as a political stream.
"Bolivia will never give up on his right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we need to go forward."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it is believed by the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never remove its nuclear weapons first if it could not have confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called for the U.S. to follow the pledges made during a meeting in Singapore between opposition leaders.
His comments are coming when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish a nuclear diploma that had not been successful for more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "small dream" to promote US sanctions and opposition to a report that ends the Korean War will ever make the North weak.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first do the necessary measures of disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump all want a second meeting.
But there is a great doubt that Pyongyang is considering the elimination process that the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host Kim-Trump's second meeting.
The fashion shows in Paris show the modern headlines heading towards the Beautiful Shops next to you
If you want to add a collection of your hats or prevent the sun completely then you have searched the solution.
Professionals Valentino and Thom Browne launched huge headlines at their collection SS19 in a stage show that proved creatively surprised at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The hats that are hard to create have attracted many on Instagram this summer and these designers have given these beautiful hats to use in the fashion platform.
Valentino's most impressive cap belonged to a tandem hat set on broad fur-like edges that covered the heads of the model.
Other major instruments include tittimaji, wizard hat and even pineapple - but are not designed to give your head warm.
Thom Browne also exposed the strange dividers – at the time Halloween is approaching.
Many coloured shells had lips that were woven and resembled Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
One design was similar to a skyuba scuba diving device with a balloon and glasses, while the other was similar to a melted ice cream cocoon.
And if you continue with a lot of style information - you're lucky.
Fashion viewers predict that big hoods can be on their way to supermarkets around you.
The superhero hats offer a design in 'La Bomba', a boulevard hat with the edges of the width of the two lamps and lead everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The lebo supporters formed this complex cap that was released on social media made another high-tech design used in the fashion platform - a slalom bag of size using a model of swimming dress
The orange raffia bag, set with a raffia on the edge and a leather handle, was the most impressive at the Jacquemus' La Riviera conventions of the SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and jackets arrive at the mall next summer heat - because the designer has brought a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore the needs of large equipment.'
John Edward: Knowledge of language is important to international citizens
The Scottish independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional skills and this has continued in 2018 with another set of best test results, which are reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
In addition to an increase of more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Uskoti (common SCIS), strive to provide a better level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more and higher education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can create and implement a specific school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming popular and the preferred subject in the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language that goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build a relationship with trust with people from other countries.
Due to the recent results of this year's test, we can see that languages lead the league table with high scores in independent schools.
A total of 68<0x25> of foreign language learners gained the A-level mark.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72<0x25> of students found A's high score in Mandarin and 72<0x25> for German learners, 69<0x25> for French learners and 63<0x25> for Spanish learners also obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in the Uskoti support foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will need in their future.
Language now, as a selection lesson, are taken at the same rate as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
A study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they found when they had difficulty filling jobs, 17<0x25> was associated with lack of language skills .
More and more, language knowledge becomes important to provide young people with their later professions.
With many job opportunities needed for language, this knowledge is essential in the globalization world.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have the most real opportunity in the future to have the knowledge of life like this.
Having the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will place a person who speaks multiple languages ahead of competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75<0x25> were unable to speak a foreign language well to promote conversation in French that is the only language spoken by a percentage of twoi, 15<0x25>.
This is why investing in language training is now essential for current children.
Having many languages, limited to those of the developing world, will give children a good chance to find meaningful employment.
Within the Uskoti, each school will have a different teaching language.
Several schools will focus on more modern languages, where others will teach languages that seem to be the most important for Britain in the future to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose in independent schools, as well as training professionals in this field.
Uskot's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will provide children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their future professions.
It cannot be disputed that at this time, in the case of international trade, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be taken into account as "an international knowledge of communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, contrast and quality to the youth of the UK.
Il faut bienaire.
John Edward as Director of the Board of Independent Schools in the Uskoti
LeBron played his first game with the Lakers Sunday at San Diego
The waiting time is about to end with eager fans to see LeBron James playing the first match as a Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season match on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell described in the tweet that James could play a few minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans on Lakers' schedule of "six pre-season games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's Political Conference in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five meetings scheduled to be held next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to prove whether it is still suspended about the candidate to fill the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support in the election as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote will be held in November.
How many hours will Trump's meeting in West Virginia be and how many hours can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. Eastern Time Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting of West Virginia online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the case to be held this week about Supreme Court selector Brett Kavanaugh, which has brought much concern about allegations of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension by a Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the goal of this rally's turnout is to beat the debe of the Republican candidates in the November election to gain more popularity.
As such, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings in the coming week are aimed at empowering volunteers and supporters while the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate's control is important for its agenda so the president will travel in as many states as possible as we approach the season of further campaign activities," a spokesman for the Trump campaign committee who refused to be recognized told Reuters.
If scheduled to be held at Wesbanco Field in Wheeling, this night's conference can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh media broadcasting," according to the Western Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40<0x25> of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team demonstrates a fight to keep hopes going to a one-man game on Sunday
After three rounds on one side, a game of two players to two Saturday afternoons can be a thriller that the Ryder Cup requires
The course of ambiguity is an entirely designed concept of games but which players believe in truth and even more in competitions like this
So they'll say where's the speed now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we take it as a bit speed I think," Jordan Spieth said after the day's conclusion.
Europe has a better chance, of course, they are ahead with four points, giving up twelve of the knockouts.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have extra power and have a lot to encourage them, also considering Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together throughout the day and everyone proud of three out of four.
Spieth has been dangerous from the start of the game to the game hole and leads by being a role model.
Many of these festive noises increased as his turn progressed, inserting the ball after hitting the ball towards the hole and balancing it while he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
His ball-to-mouth hit a 15-hole match and got a lot of noise to celebrate, which shows you believe the American team has not yet been heartbroken.
"You really have to be active and take into account your own match," Spieth said.
Now that's all these players are left to do now.
Eighteen holes are waiting for them to show this.
The only players with more score than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unexplained story of the Ryder Cup.
The European superhero has four out of four tracks and has not yet made any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't beat the ball more frequently on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided beating the ball more frequently on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That quality, and how their power seems to increase between them and the crowd shows that the players will give the highest competition on Sunday and probably no other famous players can win for Europe when it ends in the Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If they all do it at the same time on different holes.
It is very early to discuss victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt accordingly with Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in a two-run game against two, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
The extra timer and two more balls in the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swiss in a situation that was difficult from.
Sunday, however, no one can crack you in the situation you'll get in.
The two-player game against the two is very exciting to look closely at because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they offer, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change instantly.
Europe has done better as a team so far and taking a big lead towards the final day but this pair's show against the pair has also shown that the U.S. team has been fighting which some, especially those in the United States, challenged.
Europe lead by 10–6 in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a good place in the Ryder Cup final after winning in a pair match and four balls by 10–6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two victories over Tiger Woods who appeared to be overwhelmed and scored a total of their points so far at Le Golf National as four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to settle with a shell that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States seemingly overwhelmed in a four-game game of the morning, winning the series 3–1.
The United States gave more opposition in pairs matches against the pair and won two matches, but were unable to clear the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to stay with the club.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the exciting weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match they teamed up well and defeated Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed good play periods but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-game match and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for a four-ball match in the morning, returned to team up with Henrik Stenson in a pairing match and lost 2 to 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not find everything though the day was beautiful, windy in the southwest of Paris.
Third round winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pattern for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
It is only twice in Ryder Cup history where the team has managed from behind with four points to go in a single game, although the Furyk team only needs from the uniform to stay with the shell.
After being in second place for two days, however, the fight to win on Sunday seems to be off with them.
North Korea says it's 'impossible' will remove weapons without the belief that others will do what they should do.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further deteriorating to believe in the United States and no way the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others doing what should be under similar circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly of the year that North Korea had taken "a good deal of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking the nuclear test centre and promising not to overload nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any faith from the United States there will be no faith in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will remove our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri again insisted on North Korea's complaints regarding Washington's opposition to the "stepping" strategy by removing nuclear weapons where North Korea would get a bailout taking a small step, its report was seen important as it did not reject the measure of removing nuclear weapons on terms how Pyongyang has done the past.
Ri referred to a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current President of the United States and the leader of North Korea Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to "get rid of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking an official solution to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang should remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to halt international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the level of pressure by using sanctions to achieve their goal by means of force and even against the "last declaration of war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions may not weaken is an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that the ongoing barriers continue to distrust each other.
"Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader touched at the UN earlier this week.
The Minister instead observed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If a partner in the issue of removing nuclear slaloms would be South Korea and not the United States, the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this terrible situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the action of targeting the United States of North Korea's mainland and rockets would not be avoided after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as "a rocket man" with the aim of executing the assassination.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destruct" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures of disarmament, but said a great job should still be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should charge Pyongyang with the steps it took.
However, the U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue in depth and without failure until we have complete, final and proven nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has added sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funds for nuclear plans and Pyongyang missiles.
Pompeo met Ri after the United Nations General Assembly later said that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had taken place, but only within several hours North Korea accused him of giving "the same terms as a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy a missile station and also a nuclear weapons station if the United States is taking "related measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "related steps" he was seeking was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and headed towards strengthening relations with Washington.
Harvard students are trained in getting enough rest.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the culture of self-reliance and read for 'all night' with coffee help.
‘The expert discovered students at the university number one in the world are ignorant about the fundamental issue of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject, which he believes is the first kind in the United States.
.He was introduced to create a lesson after giving a speech about how insomnia affects instruction.
'At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told these things now, in my last year?"
He said nobody ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which has been first introduced this year, describes students on how good sleep style helps in both professional and sports activities as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of intelligence at Harvard Medical School and the managing director of university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after finding out that the students had had been less sleepy in the week.
The hour-long lesson involves a series of shared activities.
In one section is a picture of a bedroom, where students click for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are described about the effects of coffee and lighting and how sporting activities are affected by insomnia and the importance of sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, malnutrition and cancer.
The college map and the icon share, then encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the lesson won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know the damage to health when you smoke, 'Professional Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'creating' is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure for students means sleeplessness was an ongoing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep, well-balanced, you should be the 'secret sleep' of the student to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind uncomfortable and make you hungry at all times.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a lesson, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and gave him the ability to create a whole college lesson.
The next step, he sends a message, is to ask all graduate students to do the same lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider placing a sleeping alarm as well as a time bell to wake up and be aware of the effects of 'blue light' given by electric screens and LED lights, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's Bao steals Gerrard's youngsters
Rangers lost again in another foreign game as Dolly Menga's catch was stolen to Steven Gerrard's team that appeared to be overwhelmed by a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was intending to secure their first foreign championship since a 4–1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team as eight points behind Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break with the Rangers never looked like it would balance them.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and they are just behind Hibernian with the difference of the gorillas.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the flag bearer Calum Spence needed treatment after a head injury with something fired from Rangers supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that tied Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got uniforms against Hearts last week and will be pleased with how his well-organized team faced their opponents all the time.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball but Livingston took advantage of their chances when they found the ball.
They were to only close the second minute when the first Menga ball gave Scott Pittman the lead to Allan McGregor's gate but the link threw the ball out.
A wicket-keeper from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was able to hit just outside the goal.
The Rangers took control but their game seemed more than reliable but not self-confidence as they approached the closing scene.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to get the penaltimate 15 minutes after being hit by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game would continue even after the Colombian claim.
Rangers were able to score two touchdowns in the goal during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly would not be severely disappointed by head ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak interception from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute did not come from a normal game, no one could refuse to qualify for the win.
Again the Rangers were unable to face a penalty kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who was strong and hit the ball towards Menga who touched and scored.
Gerrard made a decision during the break and switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the hiatus was about to score when the link threw ball to Morelos but Kelly ran from his place and blocked the ball.
But Livingston continued to confuse the visitors and make them play as they want, with Lithgow and Halkett beating the ball long after the other.
Holt's team could add a goal in the last minutes but McGregor was solid and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out with the head.
Rangers goalkeeper Glenn Middleton had another penaltimate claim in the last minutes as they faced Jacobs but referee Thomson again ignored the request away.
The Year's Shajara: Geiger Counter tool inventor
And now a page from our annual "Sunday Morning" : September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and on KUHESABU ... a day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and radiation testing, an innovation that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger Counter.
The foundation of science since then, the Geiger Counter began to become popular in popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's a counter Geiger device, it's used to detect the minerals of the ionizers, such as uranium.
When installing these head devices, you can hear the effects of the atoms produced by the consumer within the mineral."
Evans: "Say, it's starting to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63 year birthday.
But a discovery named after him survives.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system 'see' the bad cell
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system 'see' a bad cell and kill it
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of the treatment
The technique involves cooling the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory
Then they can 'see' a protein that is popular in many cancers and then re-installed.
The experimental vaccine shows positive results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with vaccination, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves stabilizing the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the lab so that they can "see" the normal protein for most cancers known as HER2, and then recombinant the cells.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the Saratani Institute of the United States at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancers," including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and gut and puru, Prof Berzofsky described.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" how to target cancer cells has worked in treating leukemia.

Kanye Kanye West was buried in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a high-profile performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he could take office for them in 2020.
After an exhibition of his third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore a hat written on Make America Great, he began scolding the Democrats and promised support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man he says: "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would leave America so long ago," he said.
SNL's show began with a brief storyline consisting of Matt Damon where the Hollywood star denounced Brett Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Committee regarding allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the episode was not broadcast, West's verbal content was packaged in social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock attempted to taunt West for the publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had a difficult time before entering the stage in connection with his cap.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go there with that hat.'
You've been bullying!
And then they said I'm in a situation where I'm drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a sinking place?" saying that he will wear my hero's helmet, because this means you can't tell me what I'm fit to do. What do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments warned him to be buried at least twice from the audience and the SNL staff who were seen embarrassed, the Variety Center reported, and a man there reporting a citation: "The entire studio went completely silent."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love It, dressed as Perrier's Water Bottle.
West was joined by conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner who published a tweet: "For one of the most brave people: ASSANTE TO EVER AND MMA."
But talk show host Karen Hunter published the tweet that West was simply "showing his attitude and that it is a very good thing."
"But I opted for another person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "play") who I believe agrees to spread a belief that is dangerous to my community.
He has freedom.
Even we too," he added.
Before the show, the hacker announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be " officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His co-founder, Snoop Dogg has changed to the so-called Snoop Lion and of course the late bassist Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.

Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington starring poisoned male
Kit Harington starred in the sword as Jon Snow in the disciplinary series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the actor, 31, has rebuked those who have a high male opium, saying the roles on the screen mean younger boys often feel like they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'there's something ruined in place' and questioned how to deal with the toxic male problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow star Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted feeling 'too much' in handling this issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at present - where are we wrong in the issue of masculine?', he said.
'What have we been teaching men when they grow up, according to the problem we see now?'
'Kit believes that television can be a part of the increase in toxic male maleity from its male characters.
He continued: 'What is natural and what is taught?
It's what's taught on television, and in the streets, which makes little boys feel they should be this kind of man?
I think that's one of the biggest questions for the moment we live - how will we change that?
Because things are definitely going wrong for our youth.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in the preseasons and pursuit of the Game of Throne when the series culminates in the next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield and horse.
From November Kit will be involved in a film from Sam Shepard True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The character recently revealed that the stage encounter with his wife Rose was the best result of his involvement in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife at this point, so I found my future family, and my life from there,' he said.
Rose starred as Ygrittt , the love interest of the character Jon Snow who played as Kit, in the award-winning series Emmy Awards.
The lovers married in June 2018 at the Leslie Scotland family property.
HIV<0x2F>AIDS: China reports a 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health leaders say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Many of the new episodes were caused by sex, and suggested changes from the past.
HIV was generally spread rapidly in other areas of China due to blood transfusion.
But the number of HIV infected people in this way had decreased to zero, Chinese health leaders said in a meeting in Yunnan province.
. The year after year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be extremely high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90<0x25> of men in same-sex marriages eventually kill women.
Many outbreaks of disease come from a lack of use of immunity during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with this issue.
Maxine Waters denied that her employee exposed the GOP senators' data, scolding the 'critical lie' and 'crime theories'
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that his employee published a personal description of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of the Senators.
The Democrat MP from Los Angeles said that the allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "right-wing supporters".
"A lie, a lie, and more meaningless lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Comments made are alleged to include home addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
Comments appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court selector Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure occurred a few days after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address that recognizes the source of publications was associated with the Waters office and commenting on a Waters employee, Hill reported.
"These underlying claims are completely false and misleading," Waters continued.
"My employee - whose identity, personal details, and security have been affected by these allegations of fraud and lies - was never involved and exposed to these details.
The underlying claims are completely false and misleading."
Waters' report was quickly used online, including former Information Minister in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This cut is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he has no control over the right feelings to become a Parliamentary Commissioner.
When a person is used for something he doesn't act, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be worried.
There should be no question of the motivation of the complainant.
He should be calm and unconcerned.
"Fleischer was seen as comparing Waters' response to critics' criticism of the Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics for appearing angry during a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate through the Republican party who is seeking to remove Waters in a representative election, also published his ideas on Twitter.
"The big thing if I'm right," he said to the tweet.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that those who did this are exposed, "continued," and that they will legally be responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to everyone and all my employees."
Johnny English film review Strikes Again - a joke in Rowan Atkinson's obituary
It is common to look at the effects of Brexit in any new film leaning on the UK but this does not apply in the warmth of another comedy-warming film to Johnny English comedy - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the humor of a personal joke on the topic of how we're going to be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-catching, a moving face is licensed to make mistakes again in a repetitive manner - the name showing his most sign that he has been designed with broad humor for English-speaking people.
He is actually a chichi spy who despite strange demands for a pleasant plea shows Clouseau's qualities, the qualities of Mr Bean and the man who contributed one of the Charities of Fire's landscape music at the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He was initially involved as a traveller and international celebrity Atkinson was once involved in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV broadcasts, leaving many if not interested.
There's one or two things in this latest JE movie.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a jacket of weapons and pawns changing over time on his hat.
Atkinson's talent in physical comedy was reflected here, but the humor seems to be low and unnecessary, disenchanted because films "big" such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The comedy appears to be aimed at children and not adults and wrestled with me Johnny English's unique adventures is not creative and has no focus on how Atkinson's silent film comic as the character Bean.
The annual assumption is currently being that Britain is in great trouble.
An online raider has been able to enter the secret network of the British web and expose the identity of all British investigators out of work and surprise the detective in the workplace – very sadly it was a very simple role for Kevin Eldon.
In his final time as a proud chief and facing many oppositions and he has already been deeply affected in political popularity: Emma Thompson does very well for his character equivalent to Teresa May but the story does not help him to show these qualities.
His security advisors inform him that because the identity of each investigator has been exposed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher in a prestigious school, but teaches informal training on how to be a secret detective: some good humor there, while English teaches detectives similar to the School of Rock film.
English is once again referred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and connected to his former partner Bough, again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with the commander of the fleet, an exciting position where Vicki Pepperdine has not been involved.
Thus the characters who correspond to Batman and Robin but by destroying things in the Kingdom Secret Service return to work and in line with Olga Kurylenko acting as Ophelia Butletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister seems to be more involved with a sparse spy claiming to be able to solve all technology problems in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend hotel attendants, are setting fire in a French villa; they start a riot and enter without permission in Volta's fancy boat; and English causes the cashes as they try to use modified Reality equipment to learn the interiors of the dragons.
All of the breakouts have certainly been removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the tension and the turbulence iteration, there are so many characteristics of children's sessions in the film hio.
Suitable for good.
And just as it has other Johnny English films I had to ask them again: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Football Association denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but was paid for five days.
The Leba Party led by Jeremy Corbyn will take into account a sharp deal that the British will work four days on the wiki - but are paid five days.
The party is alleged to require corporate leaders to pay money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by granting them extra day.
It will keep workers growing up to three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea would 'fit' the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Labor Union Centre as a means of staff taking on a changing economic opportunity.
The main source of the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't take place once but four working days is equivalent to the party's attitude in economic balance for the workers and also the party's overall strategy for the sector.'
'The Leba Party will not be the first to propose such an idea, the Green Party promised four working days per week during its 2017 campaign for the general election.
Ari hio is currently not supported by all in the Leba Party, however.
A spokeswoman for the Leba Party said: 'Four days of work per week is not a party policy and has not been taken into account by the party.'
Chansela alternative John McDonnell used the last week's Leba conference to describe his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to remove power from 'invisible directors' and 'self-employed' in service companies.
The Chansela alternative plan also means that current mathematicians in water companies will not be able to restore all their funds because the Leba Government can make a 'substantial' on the grounds of identified errors.
He also confirmed that plans to place employees on company boards and create Ownership Funds to provide 10<0x25> of the company's personal money to employees, who will be eligible for an annual <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy describes the "60 Minutes" if an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh may change their ideas
The FBI's investigation into charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote regarding his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question whether the outcome of the FBI can change the ideas of Republican senators to support.
In an interview published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" columnist Scott Pelley asked Senators.wa Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could get anything that could cause them to change their ideas.
Kennedy appeared to be more opener than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said towards the case, I said, I've talked to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I phoned him after this happened, when the allegations came up, I said, 'Did you do that?"
He was stable, accurate."
Graham's vote, however, seems unlikely to change.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it'll take very serious charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused, "Graham added, meaning Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved couldn't prove.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see anything new to change."
What Is the World Citizens Festival and Has It Made Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens Festival, a music event that includes an impressive list of stars singing as well as an equally attractive message; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen's Festival will lead tens of thousands to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness for the true purpose of the event to stop the poverty that it took up to 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which stated in 2012 that it is a continuation of the World Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people directly facing it.
In order to obtain a free event ticket (except if you would like to pay a VIP ticket), festival supporters had to complete a series of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing to a world leader, calling or any other effort to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Citizens Festival been successful remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of raising people for free concert tickets is a real way to persuade people to push for action, or simply another case known as "a mere online activism"—people feel that they are bringing a real difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Festival has stated that more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have urged world leaders to announce promises and policies that are equivalent to <0x24>37 billion that will change lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, this group showed 390 promises and advertisements based on its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion already distributed or donated.
The group estimates the funds available to date have directly affected around 649 million people around the world.
Some important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aiming to "help children reach all their potential," promising to give 35 million to Rwanda to help stop malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from the World Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments, and World Citizens like you, we can make social bullying of having no better nutrition than history," Ambassador to Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were completed in asking Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and better nutrition.
In response to a question in a section of <0x51>uestions and Answers on his website asking "why does it make you think we can end the poverty it took?"
Citizens of the World Citizens Festival replied: It'll be a long and hard way - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, it was with human rights activists and groups against racism in front of us, we will succeed, because we have power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e is one of the stars to sing at the event in New York, which locals will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use the Navy to "stop" Russia's external energy sales - Interior Minister
Washington may be "if necessary" to use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has said, as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria - especially, where it works with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason for them to be the Middle East is to find energy markets how they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and strategies to deal with this.
"The United Nations has that ability, along with our Navy, to ensure that the sea routes have been opened, and, if necessary, to prevent, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants who attended the event organized by the User Energy League, a non-profit group that says it represents the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He continued to compare the ways Washington uses to discriminate against Russia and Iran, and said that the countries are identical.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, in accordance with the use and replacement of oil," he said, referring to Russia as "a bit of knowledge" and the economy based on coal oil.
The reports arrive at a time when Trump's administration has been in a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very affordable option for European users.
As a result, Trump administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" project of the "Nord Stream 2 pipeline," which according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Nord Stream 2 of 11 billion barrels, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
Kremlin says that most of Washington's opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not appropriate to be a pressure-driven tool and that users should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been used by Germany, which has confirmed his commitment to the project.
The German leading agency in the sector, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called for the United States to abstain from EU energy policy and the treaties of two countries between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chansela Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Will Look Deep" 2020 Presidential candidate, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she could "look deeply" if she would run for president after the election of representatives.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government and which includes a woman in authority," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look into detail if I run for president."
Warren spoke to President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in a wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned within me about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been extensively discussing his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said "We definitely need an FBI investigation before voting."
"A poll released on Thursday, however, showed with a large number of voters in the Warren area they don't feel that he should run for 2020.
59<0x25> of voters who are "able" to vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to Suffolk University's Political Research University<0x2F>Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported similar candidates.
Research showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38<0x25> supporting and 48<0x25> refusing.
Other well-known names of Democrats considered to be potential candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites traumatic traumatic traumatic event for Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, I can understand other families that are going through the effects of traumatic trauma and some of the effects our soldiers return with," he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin mentioned the point of arresting him as "something tatanish avoidance" and said that his son and other war veterans, "returns differently, they return with a hard ideology, come back wondering if there is respect that they are adhi and astronauts and every other military partner, for his commitment to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with woman's domestic abuse and affecting a report of domestic abuse and possession of weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, DCs support new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small friend-of-the-art report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in opposition to the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. against Sessions which was filed by the United States Civil Liberties Union held in August against the country's policy has not been disclosed.
He said his lover "and his sons the gang members," abused him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing the problems of crime groups and domestic abuse.
A new asylum policy in the United States changed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appropriations Board which allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic abuse to be given asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, state and international laws."
"The federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined according to the specific facts and conditions of the claim, and the rejection violates the rule," said a friend-in-law statement.
Further lawyers said in a statement that a policy prohibiting immigrants from entering negatively impacts the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide an important service."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide refuge for victims who fled domestic abuse and criminal groups in June.
"A refuge is available to those who flee their country because of bullying or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a group of communities or political views," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement about the policy.
The process of giving asylum was not meant to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - which people face daily around the world.
Many rescue efforts in the Palu as the number of fatalities doubles in the race for survivors,
With the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It looks terrible," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her flurry child at a rescue station in the city of Palu.
"Every minute aunt brings the bodies.
Clean water is not readily available."
"The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, taking wet supplies, trying to save anything they can get.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 quake, having failed to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, drowned him outside the Palu Military Hospital , where patients were being treated outside due to the continued development of later earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he recited how a severe earthquake shook the room in the fifth floor of the hotel they had his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I was sprayed in wall debris, I think, "Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry with help, but then she became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador denounces China for 'violence' through 'propaganda announcements'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper that reflected the joint benefit of American and Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using U.S. journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week referred to an add-on to China Daily's payroll at Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa State - after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the November 6, U.S. delegation's election, allegations China has opposed.
Trump's claims that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections show what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast-paced campaign to push for China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to post advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently dealing in trade wars that have caused an increase in the rate of tribute to individual goods.
China's prepayment in business was created to affect exporters from states such as Iowa which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had a negative impact on workers, farmers and American businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a clip of comments at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the harassment by posting propaganda ads to independent media."
"In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a way that has been sponsored by the United States of free speech and free material by posting paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, on the parts of local newspapers in Beijing, you will find very few voices providing opposition and you will not be able to see the real situation and the different opinions that Chinese people may have regarding the conflicting economic goals of China, considering that the media is closely controlled by the Communist Party of China."
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what magazine.
Republican Separate Women Vote To Vote for a Period of Representative Votes Using Kavanaugh's Conflict, analyst Warn
While many supporters defend an elected member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will get the worst results, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The feeling surrounding this has been very high and many of the Republicans openly indicated that they wanted to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed, "Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in a post published Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that the last time pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to heal voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and even all November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the development group of the MovOn said on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they rallied in the Senate highway as the Republicans confirming the Court Committee chose to continue and appointed Kavanaugh despite evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of the Democrats has exceeded expectations", "St. Rothenberg, an independent political commentator, told the news website.
"People say it has already reached the top level; that's true.
But it can be higher, less common among women voters in suburbs and small voters, aged 18 to 29, when they don't like the president, they often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public evidence described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's selector, critics said adverse results could follow if the Naj Republicans continue and confirm.
"This has been a drop-out game for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh is appointed, it's also about the way Republicans have dealt with this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of the Parties USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, has said on the newsstand.
However, Americans seem to have a certain division about who is believed after the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, with many leaning on Kavanaugh.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41<0x25> of participants clearly or perhaps believed Ford's testimony, while 35<0x25> said it was obvious or perhaps believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38<0x25> said they thought Kavanaugh was clearly or perhaps lied during his testimony, while only 30<0x25> have said the same in relation to Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the Supreme Court's Selector revealed his secrets while they attended a ceremony while at school in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Developer Plans to Start a New Web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of World Wide Web, is launching a new business that will offer competition against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The latest project of the technologist, Inrupt, is a company that is created through the Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored by people who are allowed to access access information.
In a special interview with Fast's company, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's intentions are to "rule the world."
"We should do it now," he said in connection with business.
"It's a historical moment."
Programs use Solid technology to allow people to create a "personal data repository online" or POD.
It can include a list of communication, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Archive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser and at a time.
And unique about the storage of personal data online is that only a user can access what type of description.
The company refers to this as "personal access through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company Managing Director John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and accurate knowledge to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Bruce of Berners-Lee, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the architects hired to create this project by a dedicated code developer community.
Starting this week, technology designers around the world can create their own local programs using tools available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: A Priest Who Won the Victoria Cross Award at WW1
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross award during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellengiles and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a target raider four days later and never discovered that he had won the highest British military award.
A memorial stone is revealed by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that "it's a wonderful example" that the stone is revealed especially 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his regiment alongside the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "through heavy fog and heavy firing from the field and guns."
He later ran into the firing line and for "the greatest courage" led the line to the front before using a field gun alone and targeting three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German target raider on 4 October 1918 - more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "the actions I know I can't reach but it's very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also installed a flower crown after a parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "he was feeling very honorable to participate in the parade" and added "the courage of the real hero is expressed with support from many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Pappa Pig instead,
Think of this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 except for rejection of the main event.
The bus from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was airing live all night in the United Kingdom via Channel 5.
At 12 a.m., as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to know each other, viewers in the UK were left open mouths while the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after staying awake to the early hours especially for fighting.
A fan on Twitter described changing and putting children's cartoons as "a sort of horrible joke."
"It's a government principle where it came at 12 a.m. content wasn't appropriate so it had to change the program to become children's," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Bellator's markets and communications, when asked about espionage."
""Pappa the Pig", "yes."
Bellator Scott Coker said they will go to work on their schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repeats, I think we might probably consider this," Coker said.
"But now it's at 12 a.m. Sunday there and we can't consider this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we take into account.
Believe me, when it changed there was a lot of messages being sent and it didn't grow nice.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you that a future like that won't happen.
We'll put it in five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we tried to make a effort for fans but failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'feel' because of his sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt so depressed due to his gender throughout his development - but this gave him a life-saving motivator.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize it until he joined the kindergarten was "I realized not everyone like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 at Desert Island Discs prepared by Lauren Laverne, she says that she talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He says that parental action made him less interested in winning at the Olympics.
A long-time producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for a period due to illness.
Participating as an outcast in Laverne's first episode, Daley says that she felt "a certain shortage" than everyone of her age because it was "not accepted kijmami to love girls and boys."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of self-esteem and some deficiencies, and feeling different from others are things that have given me strength and potential."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone eventually discover his gender.
The double winner of the bronze medallist for Olympic sports has been a prominent member in LGBT support campaigns and was used for a scout to participate in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to consider the issue of same-sex sex as a crime.
He said he came up because he felt lucky to be able to live without effect and wanted to give others "hope."
This triple world champion said to be in love with another man - the American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "found him unexpectedly."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is old to invite him for 20 years, last year but said that the age gap has never been a big issue.
"When you go through a lot of things in a very young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find a man of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all her attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win the gold medal'", he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
"His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they still got their Olympic tickets London 2012 - because he wanted to be the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'can't go close to the hizo dada' column," he said.
"I had held his hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and die I believed he had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was the one I had lost for all my life - diving in front of the crowd of our people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also urged his choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had given him a boost during the preparations for the Olympics and made him mussum.

Mickelson who has been poorly coached is placed on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he won't reach the hiatus unhappy.
Mickelson, playing in a two-run event a year and setting a 12th-round playoff record, was posted on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for a four-game game and a pairing.
Instead of being in the depth of the event, how often he was for the United States, this five-hole winner divided his day between being a fan and practicing the game in hopes of fixing his problem.
Never is the leader even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for a game in the Le Golf National, which bad football is repeatedly punished.
And if the field is not a sufficient reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces England champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind as they start a 12-man match, have great opposition, Mickelson's match can prove to be quite important.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood what the role he had today, greeted me and hugged me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great courage in his ability.
He is a celebrity and has contributed much to these teams in the past days and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should consider.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It may be his last in playing Ryder Cup which has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's a clown, bold, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have him on the team," he explained.
"I think that chip players were also happy to fight him too this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of many points can be lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from the experience that a major lead coming into the final days of the Ryder Cup can turn into a troubled journey.
Biden played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Sever Ballesteros led by five points against the Americans but finished with the game in a slump, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very closely," said Bjorn, having been photographed, after watching Class of 2018 win 5–3 Friday and yesterday leading 10–6 in Le Golf National.
So history points to me and everyone on the team that the game is still over.
You're going to be tougher there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you've done things how they should.
This game is over until you get a score.
We have a goal and it's trying to win this shell and that's what we're looking at.
I've said this all the time, I consider 12 players who are in our team, but we know the best quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
"He's pleased with how his players did in a difficult stadium, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't have had any more hope of this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that you will decide and that's a different thing.
It's good to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there on your own, then you've been perfectly tested for all your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you need to tell the players, it's to act with your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner to go and act better to wake up, too.
"In contrast to Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furyk will send his players to do better if they were personally compared to when they played as partners, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was involved in the popular games on the final day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing in defeat when Europe got "The Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when he was sold about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, brought his players together to the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was in Brookline, as you've seen in Medina.
When the speed goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those intermediate matches.
We organized our players effectively and put people in a way that we felt we liked, you know, we're trying to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given a job trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in a high-profile match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter others in the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it shines the whole trip," said Bjorn to his choice of players in a private game.
A new German warship refueled
The newest ship of the German Navy was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace the old ship used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to bad systems and increased costs, the press reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship between the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine which quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but future delivery issues affected the fate of this major project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 are coming to replace the Bremen-class battleships.
It is known that they will include a powerful lantern, aeroplane lift column and ship-loading missiles and also secret technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and accolade signals.
Other important components include organizations over time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
However, ongoing delays mean that the high-speed warships - said to allow Germany to target abroad - will already be obsolete when they are in service, he explained to Die Zeit.
The F125 became famous last year, when the German Navy refused to launch a ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to shipbuilders after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the restoration, but the German media referred to a number of reasons for "essential software defects and hulls" that made ships less useful if they were to be delivered to war.
The shortage in the program was important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will be operated by 120 sailors - just half a crew on Bremen's old ships.
Also, it turned out that the ship has extra weight the thing ablo reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to improve it in the future.
The ship's "Rheinland-Pfalz" 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy compared to similar ships used by the Germans in the Second Great War.
In addition to faulty hulls, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (<0x24>3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
Problems facing a new ship are particularly important from the warning that the German arbitration capacity has fallen.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Emancipation actually "will go missing ships capable of being sent to war."
The official said that the issue had long been ignored, because old ships were removed but no alternative ships were issued.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg type ships would be used by the Navy.
The Nationa Trust delivers a secret life of bats
A new study in the region in the Uskoti Mountains is aimed at defining how bats use the environment to hunt their food.
You expect these results will provide new explanations regarding the behavior of these unique flying animals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Uskoti will follow the pipistrelles and soprano bats as well as the long eared bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas near the area to track bat operations throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct phone checks using hand-to-hand combat.
A sound analysis in the discipline of all records will prove the frequency of bat sounds and the species that do so.
The environment map and reports will be presented to create a comprehensive-scale graphical environment for their behaviors.
Rob Dewar, an advocate for natural conservation in the NTS, expects the results to show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
These explanations will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as pasture formation and better conservation methods for bats and related species.
The number of bats in the United Kingdom and England has declined significantly over the last century.
They find a threat from building and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights can also cause hazards, as well as pesticides and some chemical products for building materials, as well as pet cats attacks.
The bubbles are not particularly blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits their ears are more important than their eyes arriving is the process of catching prey.
They use a complex area echo technique to target insects and obstacles in their way.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks 76,000 hectares of land across the country, pays attention to bats.
It has provided training for ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct research, nest inspections and sometimes save bats.
The organization has even established the first and unique Scottish bat reserve on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight of the top ten batsmen in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson has said the property is a better place for the batsmen.
"Here at the Threave we have a big area for the bat," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good environments.
But there is much about a bat that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other resources will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He emphasizes the importance of observing the presence of bats before making organizations within the property because it is possible for unconscious destruction you can kill up to a female bat and 400 young bats, and possibly destroy the entire number of bats in the area.
Spoilers are protected and illegal to kill, harass or disrupt or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Popo Conservation Association, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats because most of our species don't know how many of them have remained."
Ronaldo denied allegations of rape while lawyers planned to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the allegations of rape against him are "false news," saying that people are "wanted to declare themselves" under his name.
His lawyers have planned to appeal to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus have been charged with rape of an American woman , named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have later paid <0x24>375,000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram One for 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33-year-old, reprimanded the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, "five times Ballon d'Or winner says on camera."
"They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for naming my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm happy and I'm okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they said are "an unacceptable statement of suspicion in a private area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek the execution of "moral damage according to the weight of violations, which may be one of the largest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have been held in June 2009 in a slum at the Hotel and Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to return to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her back, according to documents filed at Clark County County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled down after the incident and told him that for "99<0x25>" he is a "good" person who was dropped by a "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the manga had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that he went to report to the police and was photographed of his injuries in the hospital, but later accepted a court-martial compensation because he felt "a fear of retaliation" and was concerned about "a public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now ready to pay compensation because she continues to be distracted by the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the demands, and this season he moved to Italian champions Juve when he was purchased for <0xC2><0xA3>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret forever' for the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will 'never regret' for losing its position as world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was putting "insecure" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a contract it could stop for the duration of production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
The Japanese automaker said the effect of expansion delays if there is no contract after Brexit would lead to a loss of employment.
Burnaston Factory - which manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year where 90<0x25> were exported to the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in March we will see a move to stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the European Union without an agreement on how the border industry will operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues are related to what manufacturers say are the risks of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is implemented on a "time-appropriate basis" basis, with equipment arriving every 37 minutes from retailers in the UK and the European Union for ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there may be problems in the border that the sector says can cause delays in hardware shortages.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for the Checkers for future relations with the European Union is "correctly planned to avoid the investigation at the border."
"We need to have a plan. We want to have a better agreement that will allow not only the success at the moment but also take the opportunity available," he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"A witness from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue to get the distribution that has been successful in the past."
Toyota was unable to say the duration of production suspension, but for a long time, it warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and ultimately loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union in the factory, said his allies are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience after these jobs leave they never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have set a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "defeated for another week" with the conflict in relation to the Supreme Court's selector Brett Kavanaugh continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor David Mueller, who investigates election intervention with Russia, the relationship between Trump's and Russia's deputies and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump seeks the job of deputy attorney general and thus endangering Mueller's independence, it has fueled Washington's speculation for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing wires to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, while it was said that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at a New York United Nations conference, was announced to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he "subjected" not to dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with a case in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, causing a delay in the full Senate vote.
Trump's news secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The date for that has not been set, it can be this week, I can see that causing it to be pushed back for another week considering what it is in the supreme court.
But we will see what will be going to have to inform the media.
"Other journalists could object to the statement: Sanders has not hosted a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Local Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of information is not due to the dislike of television journalists of "interesting attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president makes sessions for <0x51>uestions and Answers more than any previous president before," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at the data."
"The presentation of information to the press will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has the chance to ask him a direct question to the president of the United States, that's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen it do more in the last few weeks and that this will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump responds regularly to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open hearings or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media alone are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving a speech unorganized and sometimes appearing in front of the assembled press.
Health Minister writes to European Union workers in the Health Organization Uskoti about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health has written to European Union employees working at the Health Organization Uskoti offering thanks for the country and expecting them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months to England to withdraw from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland is committed to achieving the cost of the application of housing status to European Union citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer period, talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union about withdrawal have continued, towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the British Government also improving its provisions to the impossible state of solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how I appreciate the contribution of each worker, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners from all over the European Union and more, bring important experiences and knowledge that strengthen and improve the work of health care, and help patients and the community we serve.
Uskoti is your home completely and we want you very much to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent Emergency Surgery After Head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christian Abercrombie suffered an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game they lost 31–27 on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that an injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and only stole it," Reed said.
The staff and medical doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edges before placing him on the cheles for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV's show in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation about the type<0x2F> rate of pain still" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which increased the number of tackles in the season to 18.
Outsiders will be compensated for high stamp tribute buying in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be compensated for high stamp tribute buying property in the UK with additional funds being used to help homeless under the new Tory plan
The hi move aims to balance Corbyn's success of attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tribute will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute to the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to get up to <0x24>120 million annually - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be compensated for high stamp tribute buying property in the UK - and additional funds will be used to help homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will appear as an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has found to attract young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tribute will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their tributes to the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to combat settlement status for homeless people.
The additional fees - which include the current stamp tribute, including the high rates set two years ago in second-houses and rental homes - could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the hio phase will give it up to <0x24>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13<0x25> of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-British residents, leading to an increase in prices and making it difficult for the first buyers to buy their first home.
Many wealthy parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "wild towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend more their time abroad.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for a discount in stamp tribute to help younger people buy their first house.
He accused large construction firms of placing high property prices by buying real estate and failing to build them and asking Mrs. May to withdraw from renting the house in order to repair the "obsession in the housing sector" of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an interesting series in residential reform, including tax control to threaten the state of eviction "without error".
He also wants to give councillors more authority to build a new house.
Ms. May said: "I wanted to volunteer last year to revive Britain's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means replacing our damaged residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it can't be fair to people who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buying homes at the same price as hard-working residents in the UK.
For so many people the dream of ownership of the house has been so far away and there is a lot of possibility of homeless."
Jack Ross: 'The point of my determination is to be the boss of the Scots'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "internal" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.'
This Scotsman, aged 42, enjoys the challenge of resurrecting the North-East club, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was able to get a country game for Team B and it got to that point, "Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound show.
"But I grew up watching the Uskoti in Hampden with my father as a child and I have always been attracted to it.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I succeed in club management."
"The forerunners of Ross as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he had no fear of following the famous names in such a big club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be measured with 'je, can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and equipment at this club, it should certainly be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple job to return, but I'd just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back up there."
"Ross has only three years since he started a managerial career, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as an apprentice at the Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from being dropped to third and replacing St Mirren from being relegated to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better than he was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Another was a real way," he recalled, to take charge of Alloa.
"I certainly believed management was better suited to me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I did the same, I got the income from playing and enjoying the conditions of the highest level.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.

I always wanted to be a supervisor and now I'm doing it, I feel better inside me in my whole adult life."

The best time for getting alcohol is 11.30 p.m. Saturday, research has found
The summer heat has increased drinking in the struggling British bars but has added more pressure to the restaurants.
Baa found an increase of 2.7<0x25> July - but drinking in restaurants decreased to 4.8<0x25>, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA's business consultant, which included the figures, said: "The continued sundown and the longer British participation in the World Cup means July followed the same pattern as last month of June, when bars received an increase of 2.8<0x25>, except that restaurants got even more impact.
A 1.8<0x25> discount in the restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
The drinks bar did better while the restaurants had discounts.
Food bares were affected during the summer, although not as restaurant operators.
Apparently people just want to go out and get alcohol.
Controlled bazaars received an increase in sales of 6.6<0x25> for the month and food shortages dropped by three percent."
"Paul Newman, entertainment critic and generosity at the RSM said: "These results are going on in the direction we've seen since the end of April.
The climate and the impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the drop in sales of 4.8<0x25> per year will be severely strained considering ongoing costs pressures.
Long-term summers have come at the worst time for food service providers and we'll have to wait if the average temperature we got in August will change things to good."
"The overall growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7<0x25> in July, compared to the decline in brand products.

One out of five children has secret social media accounts that are hiding from their parents
One of five children - some even 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research exposes
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown growth in the pages "Insta fake"
The statement has caused fears that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students said that they own a "main" account to show parents
One of five children - some even 11 years old - creates fake social media accounts that they keep secrets from adults.
Research for 20,000 secondary students has shown rapid growth in the account "Insta fake" - a reference to a website to share a Instagram image.
The news has added fears that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of students said they create a "main" account to show parents, while they also own other private owners.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a young man urging others to "get married."
The study of Digital Awareness UK and the British Association of Head Teachers of independent schools (HMC), found 40<0x25> of children aged 11 to 18 had two and a half accounts agreed to keep accounts privately.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's concerned that many young people are being tested in creating online areas where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been selected on the board of the Uskoti Athletes as an inactive director at the executive meeting of the executive year of the federal board.
Doyle is a Scottish athlete with the most awards and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the game to benefit from most of his experience at an international level over the last ten years.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the society of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and the community of world athletes and we are confident athletics in the Uskoti will benefit greatly by participating him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in being a voice for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead a game in the Uskot."
The American, who won the 200 m and 400 m sprint at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the total of his four Olympic golds and is now an analyst at the BBC, failed to walk after suffering a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "Last month today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it will only be known over time if I can recover and to what extent.
It's been a hard task to fully recover, to learn again how to walk and today make a comeback!
Thanks for the comfort message!"
A breast pump advertisement comparing mother to cow makes a different view online
The breast pump company has distributed online comments using an ad that compares mothers with smoked cows.
To mark the launch of what is known as "the world's quietest breast pump," a technology company by users Elvie released a humorous music video advertisement to show the freedoms the new pump gives to mothers.
The four real mothers play a densi in a barn filled with cow's food for a song that includes words such as: "Well, I'm chasing myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you've noticed these aren't my breasts."
The song goes on: "Kamua out, kill him out, I feed my children, kill him out, kill my women."
However, the announcement, published on the Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 viewing times and hundreds of views, the video has received different reviews from viewers and many say it shows the " fears" of the dairy sector.
"The worst decision using cattle to advertise this product.
If we need to get pregnant and reproduce to produce milk, unless their children are removed immediately after birth," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump enters very well inside the guminaria (Elvie<0x2F>Mother)
Another said: "It bothers a mother and a child with an idea.
But why don't you use it to announce a breast pump to mothers who are left with their children?"
Another person added: "A declaration that doesn't take into account the real situation."
Some defended the ad and one woman agreed that she felt the song was "suspicious."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I'd found one if I was still breastfeeding.
Screaming made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is ridiculous but I understood it.
This is a product of high-tech innovation," one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a fun advertisement that focuses on mother-in-law who smokes milk (often in a workplace or in a toilet) and feels like "a cow."
"This is not a declaration of praise or contempt for the dairy sector."
At the end of the video a group of women shows that they have all been playing with pumps on their dingrias.
The concept of campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use pumps say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is quite silent, has no wire or tube and is completely fit into the meridian of breastfeeding and gives women freedom by moving, holding their children and even going out when they are milking.
Ana Balarin, an associate and ECD teacher at Mother said: "Elvie's album is a revolutionary product that qualified for the launch of courage and motivation.
Considering the dissemination between describing women and dairy we wanted to keep the action of stamping the breasts and all its challenges in the care, while showing it in a way that is fun and interesting about the sense of freedom that new pumps bring.
This is not the first time that Elvis' pump has hit the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two children walked onto the stage with architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Children Immigrated to Tent Camp in the Texas Border
The number of banned immigrant children has increased even though the number of passes to date has not changed, because the politics and strict policies provided by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children to donors.
Most donors have traditionally become unregistered immigrants and are afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by promoting child demand.
Risk increased in June, when the country's authority announced that possible donors and other adult housewives would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared by immigration authority.
Last week, Mathew Albence, the senior Immigration and Customs Acting officer, testified before Congress that the organization had arrested a number of people who had asked to fund children on their own.
The agency later confirmed that 70<0x25> of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"About 80<0x25> of people who are donors or family members are here illegally in the country and most of them are criminal aliens.
. So we keep track of those people," Mr. Albence said.
At the fastest cutting stage, leaders introduced new laws that would require some of them to be submitted to the court within a month after the arrest, instead of 60 days, which was customary on the front, according to the housing staff.
Many will be presented via a meeting phone via video, rather than someone else, to request their case for legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit for help will be sent back to their country quickly.
How a child remains in detention for so long is the possibility of fear and anxiety or discouragement, which can lead to violent sensations or attempts to escape, according to charcoal workers and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
Lawyers said these issues are increasing in large centres such as Tornillo, where a sign that a child has a bad situation is ignored, due to his size.
They added that evacuating children to a tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or interact with the last friends can add to it that many already go through.
Syria tells 'military forces called' of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although it has now reached eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who is also serving as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "fully handled."
"They should leave immediately and without any condition," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism was almost complete" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and more millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred war until we save all regions of Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a multi-war country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return and blamed the "western states" for "a spread of false fear" which caused refugees to stay away.
"We have asked for an international community and human organizations to facilitate the return measures," he said.
"They put politics in the human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no building support for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a reservation of a fatality in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented the attacks of Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had "open time" and expressed hope that the military action would help militants including fighters from Nusra Front associated with Al-<0x51>aeda, who would "end."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura expects to host the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to provide a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare an electoral route.
Moualem set the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to investigate the articles of the current constitution," and to warn against intervention.
The Reasons Trump Hashide Re-election For Second Age
by the logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless viewers like progress and many change hopefully, the removal of abuse and scandals will end his presidency early.
And to be of course "the greatest end of the presidency ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of the observer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the rating of the main times has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" lead in cable television ratings for 3.5 million viewers in the main news night.
"These are things that pull people out because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC drama "Designed Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the executive offices of the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truth About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? asked.
"She said," because she's making me laugh, ""Mr. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories from Washington may later decide Roe v. v. Wade's case, if immigrant families can reunite with the health of the world economy.
The emergence is just an opportunity for viewers who have a lot of opportunities they can afford to do with him.
However, this issue exceeds a conscious citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of viewing a panel of academics discussing Bob Woodward's use of "long play" in the sources of his book "Fear," a <0xC2><0xA3>15,000 check of the skin of Paul Manafort's designer ("a heavy-duty dress", "Washington Post's body reference to the effect.
I, never, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he's doing and making it look like the show is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and architect of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's show changing characters and scenes every night (starting confrontations in the NFL, praising Kim Jong-).

He could not leave there, not if Brett Kavanaugh approached before the Senate Court Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court if not known.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing sessions in the past and people were saying," This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, "" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was funny, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign funds flood within the closest election of representatives of Parliament
It is not surprising that 17 Pennsylvanian districts have experienced financial flooding, due to the retention of parliamentary districts that found two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
The district that gained the new boundaries of Pittsburgh has Representative Conor Lamb - who won the seat in another district in the last special election of the spring season.
Lamb is running against another person, Republican Keith Rothfuss, the current leader representing Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which is widespread by 17 new.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the former districts had been painted to suit the Republicans.
The Conservatives in 17 new terms have established financial competition in the funding groups of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a special election widely followed March in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by the Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a little better to win.
The United States Imagined Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then It Left
Diplomatics said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and little pressure not to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies ripped down the Trump Administration team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the U.S.'s main diplomatic message from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding "the recent decisions of no longer recognising Taiwan," a spokesman for the department, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which earned <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included the reduction of financial aid and visa application restrictions, would have a significant impact on the Central American country and lack of employment and high rates of execution.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high level meeting on security and economic well-being and followed a similar conference last year which appeared as a front step in an effort to prevent immigrants towards the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration leaders made it clear that they wanted the rally to go ahead and effectively stop any penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to take place in mid October, with a sign of importance that the administration has placed on the convention, diplomats said.
And three American diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to provide information on the discussion comments made by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks without exposing identity.
Their views were confirmed by an external critic close to the regime and he also spoke without revealing identity.
A Study of History
The next step down could be a report by special lawyer Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's potential for obstruction of justice, where there is now much evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his investigation if Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability cases in the legislature, just as he is preparing to go again to ask for votes to the voters and perhaps ultimately the judges of his colleagues.
These are so many things that are now just talking about each other is possible and I don't say that Mr. Trump's removal in power is inevitable - nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are choices that must be made by each side of the Atlantic which will affect how long the struggle is going on.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a revolution against Hitler, only if the Western nations refused to support and support the Czechs in Munich.
We were defeated and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the ensuing murder.
The focus of history surrounds such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of changes currently.
How shall we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the job of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, someone who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in critical condition since the newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and said that he is not worth being in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' memory is incorrect.
"What if a new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete and fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, we'll vote in the election of House representatives who won't be able to get Mr. Trump to consider righteousness?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of long-term decline.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the Nazi government which at one time was using my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika sign.
With that as my heritage, how can I lack a good attitude toward our future life?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers are optimistic before the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers are host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to fill from Group G in the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented organ Graham Dorrans from playing his first match this season to a 2–2 draw against Villarreal but believes Rangers could use the result to start a lot.
"It was a good mark for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We got into the game believing we could get something and we went back with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, generally, the uniform was probably the same result.
They were probably the best in the first half and we went in the second half better.
Entering on Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get all three points but it will be a tough game because they got good results in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a good result.
Last year it was very difficult, between everything that happened to my victims and the changes in the club but there's a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same as the players are very happy; your training is the same.
We expect, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women lack sleep from the fear of savings for retirement
Although the fact that research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
About half of the people in a nationwide study said they were talking to their lovers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10<0x25> said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want family partners to care about them, but they don't take the steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide insurance business.
This is how one starts.
Talking to your boyfriend and children: you can't provide your family with service if you don't make your requirements known well before time.
Contact your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive services, because these options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Provide your financial advisor: your counselor can also help you find a way to pay the bills.
Your philanthropic options for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, a pillow insurance policy of a currency-value life to handle these costs or the independence of your wealth - the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Defend your legal cases in advance.
Get a certification document so that you can select a person you believe to manage your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your requirements if you are unable to communicate.
Also, they can keep a lawyer's contribution in your money.
You should choose someone you believe in making financial decisions for you and guarantee your expenses are paid in time.
Don't forget the details: Think that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Put these notes in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
"Not only the money they are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are treatments?
Who will handle the dog?
Set the plan right."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a major earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, leaders said and the number of fatalities expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala administration, the northern Palu region which is near the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, it is the end of a narrow plain on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was commemorating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake.
Donggala is a coastal administration over 300 km (180 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
A short-term government, administrative area under the county, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coast region of Donggala.
nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly found in Morowali, balconate and the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been threatened by tsunamis several times over the course of 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Hot Pete and is repeatedly hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the dead came from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island , off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, an island of many Indonesian residents and caused a tsunami that broke the southern coast, killing around 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra and caused a 10-metre-long tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused damage and fear as people recalled the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused at this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a while.
Sarah Palin's Chief Son Arrested for Domestic Abuse Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with assault charges.

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communications networks broke down and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.

State prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
New York state prosecutors seek death penalty for Sayfullo Saipaov, a suspect of terrorist attacks in New York City that killed eight people - a rare penalty not implemented in the state for country crime since 1953.
Saipaov, 30, is alleged to use a Home Depot rental car to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking out pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipaov "for the purpose" killed eight victims and "for purpose" caused serious physical injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All of these errors carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a panel of federal judges issued a decision of 22 charges for Cyprusov which included eight charges of murder with the help of fraud, usually used by state prosecutors in criminal cases organized by charges of violence and vandalism.
Attacks had to be "prepared and well prepared," prosecutors said, describing the action Saipanov acted as "suspicious, brutal and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaev caused injury, damage, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Paccnua's information
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York implemented capital punishment charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York state trial was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the husband and wife who were punished for death after being convicted of plotting to make a drift for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by death by being placed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Cyprusov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed remorse days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Cyprusov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Cyprusov, said that they were "depressed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will simply add it to such events for all involved," Patton said.
Cyprusov's representative team had previously asked prosecutors to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to 'raise the people' army today during a protest at the Tory meeting.
Ukip's former leader said politicians should 'feel heat' from anti-European citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be the head of talks with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain should be 'out' now if Mr. Farage were to be Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces is the challenge of bringing together his heavily divided side what became evident when Tory supporters of Remaining joined a separate protest against Brexit in the town.
The prime minister strives to implement his Kickers' consensus plan while facing criticism from supporters of Brexit, who support Remaining and the European Union.
His allies insisted that he will continue ahead with the point of attempting to reach an agreement with Brussels despite objections- and forcing the anti-European Union and the Leba party to choose between his plan and the 'terrorism'.
Mr Bone told the meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw away the Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and given the responsibility of talks with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we would already be out now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers deal.'
Showing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We didn't fight in the world war to weep under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone denied proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain completely untrue.'
'Tory MP supporting Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Scheckers' plan is not so popular with the general public, the Opposition cannot vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us to be elected.
Please stop with the Checkers' plan and start listening to people.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The Chief Ministers preserve their positions when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made to 'see warm' if they are about to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This thing is about the issue of loyalty between us—people—and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let him do it.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: 'I want you to have our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
'We encourage the army of the people of this country which will give us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we are free, to be independent, to be a glorious England.'
Meanwhile, Supporters to remain continued to march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Many activists showed posters written in Tories against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Leba MP Mr. Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they found in the party program when the meeting was opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology of the UK and the European Union to respect another's laws, by a border without problems, for free trade without limits in Ayalandi,' he added.
'It's an empty lie.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'look deeply' the intention of running for president,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she plans to "deeply look at the intention of running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats discussed his fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a recurring critic of President Donald Trump, faces re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the 2016 Trump Campaign Partnership in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of rumors that he can face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall structure since Trump was elected.
The attendee asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that involves a woman in the upper seat."
Man arrested in connection with LSU's Sims shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the deaths of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 5 a.m. ET at a meeting with reporters.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a person who was seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University of Southern early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in the head and eventually died from it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect the striker when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the scene of the incident, possession of weapons and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nearly won the World Cup after team orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas eliminated before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to pursue a pass on the tail of the group, something that had to contribute greatly.
Mercedes made one round to be behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed ahead after a tight race that made Ferrari's driver leave the free zone due to the impact of the shutdown after doing so twice in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was in seventh place for the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and held and then passed Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He eventually reached his relegation zone in the 14th round and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight rounds with Raikkonen taking fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a wonderful whole-screen job and showed maturity to let me pass.
The team has done a special job to take first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday in connection with his insistence that he did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing him of being elected to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss the testimony made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is going on in the Senate indicated that the people were "sweet, bad and lying."
"One thing that can happen and the good thing that has been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and jealous and bad and lying," he said.
"When you look at the offerings and expose them then they say" oh, I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you hide?
You remember his answer ... did you expose the document - "oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I didn't reveal it.
"Well, wait a minute.
Are we who exposed ...No, we didn't reveal it," he added, by imitating him a senator.
Feinstein was used a letter describing the charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr Ford's charges. I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it secret and I secretly put it as he asked."
But his proposals did not seem to have been well received by the president, who commented during a Saturday night meeting: "I will tell you this, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's selector, who has been charged with sexual abuse and three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see what envy, evil, they don't care who they hurt, who have affected to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the President as saying.

Flight Travel Controller Dies While Confirming Hundreds of Passengers in Flight Can Avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people has safely left.
More than 800 people have died and others have been lost after a major earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Later tremors continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades' escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position in the control tower of Mutira Sis Al Jubri Airport.
Alisalia to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
He then flew the control tower of the trampoline when he thought it was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokeswoman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision was able to save hundreds of people, ABC News of Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are breaking to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the leadership fears that the death toll can reach thousands and the country's deforestation agency has said that the access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is very small.
"The number is believed to still be rising as most bodies were still trapped under the falls while challenging to reach many," the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Six-foot-long waves have destroyed the Palu which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide support and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute aunt brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Small markets have been broken up everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help the victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the activities related to exile.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where over 550 people died.
Flight falls in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after a plane crash inside a lagoon.
The airline that owns a plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said that one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that by Saturday afternoon, it was unable to find out when he was a man.
The agency said it is cooperating with local leadership, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for further details regarding passengers, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crews after the plane crashed into water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Leaders said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The agency said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the series is still unknown.
The agency and all U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed on the lagoon just before reaching the route.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had hit water on the road.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through the water that reached the waist through the emergency doors of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants feared and shouted and that he suffered a minor injury in his head.
U.S. Marines said the sailors who were working to improve the dock almost also helped rescue them using a breathboat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 metres (100 ft)
Data from the Air Safety Network shows 111 people have died in the crash of aircraft registered by PNG over the past two decades but no one was involved with Air Niugini.
The critic shows a record of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished explaining his case on Saturday in a repeat case where a man charged with stabbing a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a professional witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used cellphone records to combine the activities of 29-year-old accused, <0x51>uinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of the disaster.
Rowlett said he received local data from several cell phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
While data showed his cell phone had Chambers' when he said he had his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
While prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was in Nashville."
"The other impossible words are that Tellis said he had known Chambers for just two weeks before his death.
Mobile records show that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted a text message and a description of Chambers' communications from his phone.
"He completely wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be sent to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: Hip hop What is it?
The trio of hip hop songs want to criticise the negative stereotype by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop was lost away from its political message nature and to deal with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make a transition hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen new popularity in the UK recently through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
Home minister New York sues couple for being fired after message "you discriminated against color"
A housekeeper from New York accuses the couple of firing him on the grounds of discrimination after receiving a note from the mother who was complaining that he was "just another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the allegations to "substantialism."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern after discovering that a new baby care provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after reaching her first day of work in 2016.
"HAPANAAAAA PUBLIC MUSIC," wrote Mrs. Plasco -Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman with "no worries" dismissed Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departing minister, of African-American origin, had done a bad job and that he was instead expecting the Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day of work and then returned home to Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation in connection with the dismissal and wants a ransom of <0x24>350 a day for the sixth month, for the job of living and working, though without a contract.
"I want to show you, look, you don't deserve to do the same actions," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's prejudice."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying that stopping Maurice work was the right move, fearing that they can no longer trust him after making him wrong.
"My wife had sent him a message that he didn't intend".
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you keep your children in the hands of someone you've wronged, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
Say the truth."
Comparing the charges to "skill," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a baby and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to sue someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has condemned the couple in social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not prefer the talking bear, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a short time after this book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the shoes of a first reading person before being published.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great success."
Speaking to his father, who worked as a camera attendant on the BBC before gaining a push to write a children's book from a small bear toy, he would not feel bad for his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who describes it as "a very important member of our family," added that his father enjoyed his success.
"He was a man with no words and he wasn't proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was very important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his architecture and thought, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to move through the phone.
After discovering that her daughter had been deported to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad was calling from time to time and said that the situation was very bad and he was not expected to live," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me he'll die within the next two minutes and I had to move on goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you so much, my child.
I'll have you soon.
I'll have you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his spirit beating were slowly ending in his system.
He had died a while before and this was just his system to stop working.
I just had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to give myself a heart.
"Unfortunately Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, flew along with other passengers—without knowing what she was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had tilted my head and tears flow all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's when I was on the plane when I was very sympathetic to Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Screaming women laying cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones by suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on the Welsh bridge with a powerful message and phone numbers that people can call.
Son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from stress of thought and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her child was a promising cook and an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him with his smile.
Everyone said his smile was pleasant to everyone."
However, he quit before he died, because he was "a place of darkness."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after committing suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis created a card, "enabling people to know that there are people out there who can go and talk to them, even if they're a friend.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old boyfriend, not long after her mother's death.
He did not say that he feels bad or is troubled by ideas," he said.
" Several days before Christmas we discovered a change in his attitude.
He was totally down on Christmas Day - while the children were opening their gifts he didn't want to look at them with eyes or communicate."
He said his death led to finding it, but they must strive to continue life: "It puts a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's fate of sliding when the FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - an inquiry with a timely climax, a height of magnitude - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" due to the controversy of apostasy.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is from time.
The election of representatives takes place only five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail greatly, then they will be very weak in their efforts to keep the person they want to be elected to a higher court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators, persuaded them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has released its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats work.
It is still unknown whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes on the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, vice president, to break uniforms and prove him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee population 'down' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un gained power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean coalition ministry, said that there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control in the border between North Korea and China and the high levels of fines imposed on the sale industry was a major factor.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Most of the refugees from the North are eventually given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Area with most of the armed forces (commonly DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to power.
Relations between the North and the South - which are literally still in the war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on talks to remove the nuclear weapons that had stopped.
The incident came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under that situation, there is no way that we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "uncontrolful," and says it is not worth staying in the Supreme Court
The Minority Leader in Parliament Nancy Pelosi has said the selection of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "non-responsible" person and said that she has so much feelings that she is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were the woman she had ever done that way, they would say 'I can't control myself,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied claims that he persecuted Dak Christine Blasey Ford while they were young.
During his opening report, Kavanaugh was very passionate, sometimes almost screaming and dying of breath talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing the charges against him as being of "aggression and planned to destroy his reputation" organized by angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved powerless to serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he discriminated against the Democrats.
"I think he's withdrawing for those words and how he denounced the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he would attempt to remove him from office Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would be majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't say the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then it's inappropriate not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court when he is right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that if a Democrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Price Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his testimony charges, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he could change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for someone who's angry, prejudices going to court and expecting us to say, 'not that's weird,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It's a good reminder of the bitters, months and years of the most wrath and can't get it out of the right.
"We are crying when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
He continued,"I was greatly helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who also said he was crying when he got angry, but he developed a technique that meant that when he was angry and started crying, he could tell someone talking to him," You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm upset."
He then continued to explain to me.
And I thought that was a good idea."
"The tears are allowed as a way to remove wrath because they are essentially unclear.
One of my memories I remember so much from my early work, is an office full of men, where once I found myself crying in an unwise rage, I was caught in the back of the neck by a great woman — a supervisor I was always scared of him - who pulled me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because they're both yours and you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found to have a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and to withdraw as a candidate, Mrs. Schroeder, was greatly disturbed by seeing no reason for not being able to qualify for the presidency.
"It wasn't a decision that did well," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to this as the popular film "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time grew so far, he was back in fundraising and so vowed that he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his supporters who contributed <0x24>1,000 to men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do they think that you wanna get a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech announcing that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with a sense of gratitude for people who helped him, confused with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates and anger from gender discrimination – until he ended up with a breath.
"You would have thought that I was nervous," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media considered the case.
"You would think the Kleenex company were my business sponsors.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave?
"He cried out"?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
Early voices in the trade war between the United States and China were very troublesome and although the war will soon end, the distinction between countries may be of benefit for Beijing for a long time, according to professionalism.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by charging significant Chinese sales including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most effective differences began this week with a new tribute affecting <0x24>200 billion worth of goods (<0x24>150 billion), thus charging half of all imports into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, it has recently placed a five to ten percent tribute to US<0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to promote US action, and the second largest country in the economy does not seem to give up any time soon.
Making Washington change the move means you should accept terms, but publicly agreeing to American pressure will be a big disgrace to <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, academics say that if Beijing can play its game well, the challenges of trade war against the United States can help China long by reducing the support between the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can start a change in the economy in any of its countries and more dangerous than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the new Center for Security Advertising in the United States.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria has said that it is ready for voluntary return to refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a long war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al- Moualem said the situation in the country is stable.
"Today the real world is more stable and secure due to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore them regularly.
All the circumstances now exist of voluntary return to refugees in the country who had to escape due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and careers.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian citizens have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country need human help.
Al- Moualem said the Syrian government will welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that they do not want assistance on terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.
Europe wins Ryder Paris Cup
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown as Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time throughout the tournament, hit his first ball in the water in the 16th hole of 3 holes, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well throughout his turn and became a player 1 out of 4 to 5–0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 by 4 and the player listed below in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
A player listed first place in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2nd and 1st to Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The player in the eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the tournament with 25.5 points in his games.
"It's not my normal right but today I'm drunk.
It's been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I'm very happy, I'm glad to win the cup again.
The key factor is the team and I'm happy I could help," said emotionally filled Garcia after the European victory.
He transfers roles to fellow U.S. Senator John Ram who defeated American star Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a one-man game on Sunday.
"I feel a strange pride, defeating Tiger Woods, I was watching him as a junior," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13–21–3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest ranked players ever, having won 14 titles and only the second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was overwhelmed with the whole week putting the ball into the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the highest level game in all competitions.
United States captain Jim Furyk spoke after his squad's low game, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning when we gave them many challenges to the European team.
We fought each other.
A lot of respect for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with our PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go ahead.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be the captain.
You must make a compliment.
They controlled us."
