Scientists are trying to create an effect that can in the same way produce energy.
This, however, is a complex problem to solve and it will take years before we see a pooling spring being built.
The steel needle floats above the water because of the atomic reactions.
The collision occurs because the atoms of water on the surface attract more to one another than the air does over it.
Water compounds form the outer layer in the water so that such substances as the needles float upward.
Today’s ski iron wheel has two sides and a covered shell between them. The two ends allow the best hold of the ice, even if it is broken.

The next image shows the atoms that produce photo. In fact, the photobox is much smaller than those.
Photos are much smaller than atoms!
