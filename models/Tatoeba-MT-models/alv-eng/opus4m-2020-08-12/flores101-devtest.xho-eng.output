In the lowlands, it is difficult for a person to supply his amino-acid needs using existing plants.
After all, doing so has bad consequences: increased stress, malnutrition, and ultimately death.

Car travel involves learning about each driver’s journey from one place to another and about how he interacts with each other.
Unfortunately, learning the flow of the vehicle is difficult because the driver’s behaviour cannot be fully met.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave well in the right line; but, of course, roads tend to have proper flexibility and can be represented in mathematical terms.
To be a better representative of traffic travel, a relationship is established among three of the most important factors: (1) walking, (2) fatigue, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps plan, design, and work.
