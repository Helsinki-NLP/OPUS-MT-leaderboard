You have to get them there.
Why at home?
Asa and my father.
Do not give up.
I am a new person here.
I shall not be afraid.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why don’t we care about them?
What a reunion that will be!
Relief at last!
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I am sure that I saw him in one place at a time.
You’re a good person.
Where are your family members?
Better it would be if you did not do so.
I am not hungry.
I’m a university student.
I lost all my keys.
We are not alone.
I want you to know that.
May I ask, Have you always benefited from it?
No one really knew what was needed.
It made me wonder.
I am one of your classmates.
Why not learn French?
Not as you think.
I would like that.
I’m glad you are there.
When do you wake up?
Does Tom know why?
What is my hour?
We have no money.
Forgive me!
I do not need them.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
That is fine.
Not only is it cold but it also cools.
I lost my pen.
When do you get up?
You can find whatever you like, or you can find a piece of paper.
She had prepared all the lunch.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Come or come?
I want to save you.
Do you want to support yourself?
I cut my head.
If you do not hear, they will come.
He is my father.
That’s what I want to know.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he will.
I can’t believe my ears.
She was said to be very rich.
His Word was miraculous.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
He does not know his parents well.
I was able to do it.
I don’t think he will.
He was taken away.
The sun rises in the east.
Why not?
It will be wonderful.
No problem.
I remember that now.
Would you like to take them?
What else is his name?
You run away from me.
My brother is not at home.
My parents called me on the floor.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
Now look at the picture.
I’m in the car.
What are you able to do?
Is this your mother?
Why does heaven look like blue?
If you do not understand, they will come.
This car is ours.
No one has a car here.
Choose for Us!
I don’t know that word.
You know me.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you looking for us?
Not at all!
What is the purpose of this work?
I lost all dignity.
My daughter will be married in the sixth month.
I know what these women are.
I understand what you say.
It makes me feel sick.
And my name, where are you going?
Are you interested in them?
Is this love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, June, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of year.
I have a question.
I hear that you are married.
By the way, how are you doing on time?
In Bible times, he was an instructor.
I lost my desire to.
I exclaimed!
Who am I?
I can see that too.
You want to see.
Commitment is the marriage due.
He is not with you.
I don’t love these people.
Are You Running on Empty?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
I thought it was your pain.
Imagine what it is like to be found in a hotel.
Don’t you come?
He is coming!
Give it up.
I don’t know how long I will have to wait.
Whose side is this?
May I come back?
Not at all!
No one knows what to do.
Do not look at the surface.
I’ll have to ask him.
We returned.
I’ll take care of you.
I know a lot about you.
No problem.
I want to learn French.
My car broke down.
You know that I love you.
I know.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is going on.
He left his car keys.
Why don’t you go home?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate sheep from goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I'm going to school with you.
Do I Know Tom?
Are you satisfied?
Should I come back?
That is why I love you.
Are you your own?
It will be warm and intense.
If you ask for a coin, give him a copy.
It is to the first one.
It is hot and humid.
You know that I love you.
The bed is warm and warm.
The answer involves time.
I accepted the money.
What do you want to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you a new person?
I know what to do.
Do You Love to Learn?
Do you have the money?
I’m not sure.
I know how it works.
What shoes are they?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is so beautiful!
Thank you for killing me at home.
I respect them.
How quiet!
She is strong.
The amount was five dollars.
I returned to my mother.
It is perfect.
Your best defense against violence is to avoid becoming a victim of cruelty.
I hurt you.
Thank you.
Do You Love to Learn?
I will give you.
Enjoy a meal.
I want the same for myself.
You are my friend.
What is our car?
No one knows what to do.
What school do you attend?
You just don’t want to know!
He is a good student.
I’m constantly thinking about myself.
Get a copy of the book.
I don’t have a house.
Thank you very much.
I know you’re right.
I think about it.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
You do not know.
I should not think so.
“ You’re going home.
My daughter is about to be married in the afternoon.
He was raised by his grandmother.
Let her alone.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my brother.
I did this for my personal benefit.
How long would you continue to work toward it?
It is two o’clock in the morning.
I gave up my glasses.
Why?
What is love?
We do.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are my beloved wife.
I will really help you.
It is up to us.
Where are your family members?
Do not utter this word again.
Sure enough, the search engine said: “0 results. ”
Where are we going?
I’m not sure.
You know where I am.
What is your purpose for your trip?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
Stop that car.
I’m not sure.
Do you know what to do?
We know.
No, you definitely should not.
Where do you want to be?
I love my environment.
Do not ask.
Should I open a window?
A few drops of rain falls on the floor.
Where are you going?
It’s such a joy!
You have to go home.
Would he be here?
Do you learn French?
You will repent of your sins.
Visiting me.
What is my car?
I don’t know how.
There I met my sister.
I know what to do.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I do it for you.
The girl was dressed like a son.
I don’t have any brothers.
Sadly, my good friend moved to another city.
Do they belong to you?
You know I have to go.
That’s your book.
Not my day.
How long did his illness last?
If he had stayed at home on that day, he would have stayed at home safely.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I don’t like it.
I know what is going on.
I know.
Good, right?
I know what you think.
It’s hot.
It was not enough, so I had to change it.
Better it would be if you did not do so.
The girl was dressed like a son.
I love to prepare a light meal for you.
I have to clean my hair.
Too little?
The owner is my brother.
I am happy for those who do.
Do you have time to help me?
Give it up.
I don’t know how to names.
Do You Know What Love Is?
There will be Saturday.
I would not die.
Tell me about your goal.
Is the book on display or on display?
I lost my pen.
Thank you for coming.
I am a baker.
There was a man standing behind the wall.
I quit school.
Well, do not give up.
Did you notice it?
Are they looking at us?
Are you a good host?
As I climbed the slope, I was overwhelmed.
Is he even there?
We shall see.
They are children.
Let’s face it, Tom!
Do not forget to bring a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a demand for a way out.
I go to school too.
I don’t have any brothers.
I even hit the finger.
What do you see?
Shyness.
Do you know where?
Where is your father?
Don’t ask me again.
Dad is home.
The pressure can be too great.
Are they Japanese?
Give me a book.
You’re a good person.
The windows are drawn to the south.
I forgot to buy.
In God’s day I shall walk.
We see it.
Where do you come from?
We are here to care for you.
I don’t know where he is.
There were a hundred people in a house.
I understand.
The tooth has no denture.
Do not be satisfied with that.
My dream had come true.
You can understand.
I don’t know what to say...
Do you know where?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you ours?
Work what is good toward those who hate you.
It’s different when you’re not.
Very little.
Conservatives do not operate today.
We are so happy.
The girl is pretty.
The door is my home.
I am no better than a good carpenter.
You do not know.
Tell them what happened.
“ You’re going home.
I did it for you.
I love your car.
Who is your teacher?
Are you going home?
Does that sound good to you?
Yes.
There is no doubt about it.
Was I interested in him?
I’m not sure.
I’m glad you are there.
I need to feel that I am not a victim.
I dropped you off.
Do not be easily swayed, and why not discuss matters with your adolescent in some way.
I don’t know what to think.
I did not know what to do.
What is behind this trend?
Where am I?
Her name?
Money spent.
I want to buy a car.
I want to go too.
It’s not fair.
What is your hour?
We fled.
By no means!
I lost all my keys.
I don’t understand this word.
I am not sure that you will be there today.
I’m looking for you.
Here you are in my house.
Your car is an interesting one.
She was said to be very rich.
No one can be certain.
Travel or Not?
We do not take them with us.
There was a temple in the first century C.E.
I know you’re right.
Oh, no.
Why don’t you go home?
Is that how you feel?
I lost all dignity.
What do you want to see?
Why do you ask?
He is coming!
I don’t have a happy day.
I’m sure he’s strong.
Be willing to make adjustments.
I know that girl.
It did not.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Perform your schoolwork.
I would like to accompany you.
I just know his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will really help you.
We understand that.
What is the family’s condition?
I speak a little Spanish.
Keep at it!
How old is he?
I need to know why.
You are not my brother.
My family is very small.
Does Tom know why?
Is he home?
I love mathematics.
I know what to do.
It’s different when you’re not.
Nothing worked.
We see each other.
Be careful!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you find them?
I don’t know one word of French.
When do you go?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
Is the phone number correct?
I don’t sleep.
It’s not French.
“ Don’t look at me!
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
They did.
Is it all necessary to travel?
I am not sure that you will be there today.
He nodded.
Are you ours?
It is not something to be proud of.
Come up!
I love the sound of that car.
I know where to turn for guidance.
Yours is similar to your A.
How much is taken?
They carry it somewhere else.
Not out!
Where do you want to be?
Look at them.
No one listened to me.
Do not forget to bring a letter.
We are here because of you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes off.
They know us.
When do you get up?
I will not give up.
From England.
You run away from me.
Do not shout at me.
Windows now open.
You don’t have to come.
No one listened.
I never forget my eyes.
I don’t think he will.
No problem.
This is the kind of rice that is used to feed the plant.
I know how they do it.
No one asked.
They want us to do so.
What do you see outside?
I think you would like that.
I’ll never see them again.
Where is Tom?
Is this French?
The owner is my sister.
From tomorrow onward, we can go to work together.
We arrived.
At home I learn French.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they will go.
It is a marvelous book.
Our arms are heavy.
I know your father.
I am learning the French language at school.
You have to go home.
Where have all the people gone?
Can you open a window?
Will you go to this summer?
Where is my mother?
If not now, when?
Is that what you are looking for?
What is your car?
My father was not at home.
There is no question about it.
What do you know?
Not at all.
Do you see it here?
No one has a solution.
There was a bullet in the bow.
He knows her.
I would be glad to see him.
My father was not at home.
Not at all!
What’s Wrong With Telephone Sex?
You can sing as well.
I feel so sorry for them!
I know how to do this perfectly.
We are jealous.
I thought you could.
Where are we?
Love is blind.
Let me explain.
I know you have.
I am not a student.
I’ll try.
A strong wind is blowing, and I am unable to move quickly.
Probably not.
I thought of my sister.
I do not give up.
How much time will you be left?
Both Asa and his Father.
What is that?
You have been disappointed.
My house is near my place of worship.
Error on word!
All the apples that are fallen to the ground will be eaten by the pigs.
I couldn’t look.
I don’t want to read them.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they are?
Where do you go to school?
Which one?
What a thought!
He gave me one.
I never see him.
What is it?
We do not know.
Why do people say this?
Tires are valuable, especially in times of history.
I have vowed.
I do not understand French.
Not at all!
Why do I have to do that?
It’s Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a baker.
How many?
We have no money.
I know that you are listening.
Strip off your shoes.
I know what you look like.
I am happy.
Is this the new car?
Why don’t you go in?
He did not read the book.
I don’t want to be rich.
You are sorry to say that I have done that.
An animal has no teeth.
This will be a cause for rejoicing.
You can go.
When Do You Come Home?
He did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is by no means new.
He knows her.
He is French.
I don’t have a car.
Take care of your head.
Why not make it your determination to keep clearly in mind what you have?
I would like that.
You can use this car.
I don’t know.
I am the teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see that?
Do not say so!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought some eggs and milk.
One scroll was missing.
I saw him again.
Is this your mother?
My family grew up in a family.
What was its purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
He is French.
It is a tall, big son.
I know who they are.
You know better.
I have a car.
When Will You Come?
It is a time for rejoicing.
You do not have to arrive.
You must quit drinking alcohol.
Think for a moment about your mother.
There is a demand for a way out.
Where did you stop?
I'm up between one and two hour.
If you have a mouth - to - mouth talk, kill yourself.
What do I wear?
Which book?
Who are the Americans?
How do they look?
“ Don’t look at me!
I am reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not in the way that you think.
Find them?
What are your possessions?
Was It a Problem With a Mistake?
We drink.
He is coming!
I Cannot Stop It
I will give advice with my eye upon you.
We are happy.
Keep the environment quiet and calm.
They don’t respect me.
I shall take them.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not at all.
I am learning the French language at school.
Why not?
I would like that.
Asa and his mother.
Are you looking for me?
Honor your mother.
You know I have to go.
Which car?
Do you love him?
We must limit the exits to entries.
A snake is at work.
I don’t have any questions today.
Do you know what you are asking for?
Open the window!
Welcome home!
The son is his brother.
Why don’t you go to school?
Why don’t we go home?
Would I like to come in?
You know that I love you.
Researchers have found the bones of a man in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see them again?
These measures can prevent the spread of disease.
That’s the factor.
We are commanded to eat a noon meal together.
Do not get offended!
It's not the subject for conversation. We're just going to the movie.
I fell in love with him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am a new person here.
I want to learn French.
I will prove to be with you.
I don’t have any of my sisters.
Sleep with me.
I have a purse.
The water is very, very cold.
If only I had checked off!
I’m open with myself.
What Is the Value?
I know where we are.
Why Do They Not Come?
I must carry my car with me.
Why not?
We are students at a university.
I don’t know his name.
I never thought of it that way before.
How do you go to school?
Forgive me!
Leave it alone.
Do not say so out of desperation!
Do you know what it is?
You are sorry to say that I have done that.
I know his family.
I know what happens.
I lost all my keys.
This is what I do.
I lost all dignity.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
Tomorrow I ate eggs.
No, you definitely should not.
We know that.
I need some rest.
No one asked.
We are jealous.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about all things.
I get up at one o’clock in the morning.
Do not open a window.
Family history.
Why not?
Why the hot?
Unless it is raining, she goes to work for the rest of the day.
It is up to us.
Don’t look at the background.
How does your little sister feel?
Can we speak in person?
Where are you going?
I enjoyed this vehicle.
Why do you learn French?
I think so.
I can see them.
I know who listens to them.
He accused the man of stealing.
I did as he said.
I couldn’t believe my ears.
I don’t know their names.
Talk to me about your goal.
I know what to do.
She was said to be very rich.
Your best defense against violence is to avoid becoming a victim of cruelty.

You do not have to thank me.
Your sister?
We want to do so.
Asa and his mother.
As individuals, we have enjoyed a measure of happiness.
We have come to see you.
Are you interested in them?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Are You Running on Empty?
You never know what happened, or do you know what happened?
I know what love is.
Not so.
The roars broke.
What are you doing here?
That’s the factor.
Nobody prepares me.
We received an education in one school.
Where have you done that?
It made me wonder.
Do you have enough rice?
Would he be here?
We can find them.
We are brothers and sisters.
I know why you are here.
Why go to college?
What is it?
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
When will you come back?
I stumbled.
It is satisfying.
Listen to your mother!
Read this.
I will give you.
What news?
“ They are in my room!
Is this a sliver of tea?
Are You Running on Empty?
I am the youngest.
How much is left?
I would like to read this book.
From Brazil.
I’m going to take you home.
We received an education in one school.
Do Not Forget Them!
I am writing to us.
Do not give the same amount of money without permission.
Do you have this money?
Very little.
It is his job.
That is what you have asked for.
He is our brother.
What do you want?
Price?
He was taken away.
I want to see.
Stop making the rules here!
Sometimes we went to the cinema together.
You’re right, don’t you?
What did you read?
Where are we going?
Why do we do that?
This is too long.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There are no trails.
He is our brother.
It is his job.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
An American?
Kaa or tea?
What is happening below?
I am sorry that I dropped you off.
We are on our own.
I love what I do.
My voice has become mute because of the sound I get.
Do you know what he said?
His Word was perfect.
When do you want to leave?
I don't understand such things.
Would that be better?
Are they also in Japan?
I will try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing a lot of time.
Why not give up?
Start a meaningful text talk without moving into other languages.
What is his family like?
Magdalena andnia are good friends.
I am happy for those who do.
We have at least one meal together for the day.
Consider one.
Do you have a brother?
We went together.
I would agree with that.
I have to think about it.
Where is Mary?
I fell sick.
I have to finish it.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think you are happy?
Why are you not with me?
No one is at home.
I mean, I really did.
He fell in love with her.
She did not become pregnant.
Why don’t they like me?
How much is cell size?
What did you give me?
Go outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
His face is intense; the brow is furrowed in concentration.
Do not be satisfied with that.
Breaking Free!
I’ll have to do that.
How many nights?
We can.
I came with a big smile.
You have to return home.
Both Asa and his Father.
You are my witnesses.
Do you know where he is?
I don’t like it.
Why don’t you go too?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
This is a fine meal.
“ You’re going home.
I don’t have any brothers.
I don’t know.
I don’t know how to name them.
Can You Review?
I guess you and I never really discussed it before.
Do you know these people?
Where is it most popular?
Why do I do it?
I don't understand.
This industry manufactures automated devices.
I am not a student.
It is not hard to see why.
Do not do that again.
Look in a window.
I don’t like it.
One scroll was missing.
He accepts the money.
He is happy.
Get off the bus.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to find them?
Remember that you did not forget your loving - kindness.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We need a talk in the local language.
So why did you come here?
I’m not sure.
I went to school.
Nobody said a word.
We are brothers and sisters.
It is hot and humid.
So I did that.
“ I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
It matters to him.
Does that make you happy?
U.S.
Whose purpose was it?
I have no sister anymore.
We are students at a university.
Nothing was new.
Are you ready to do that?
Can’t you carry on your say in the past?
No one ever saw anything.
I will try.
I would like to ask, Are you in control of the music?
I know that girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
They need water.
Where did they take you?
No problem.
I’m glad I did.
How many cups of coffee have you taken?
Who are they?
This car is very desirable.
We cannot.
The load was heavy.
We shall meet them.
Your personal information?
I know you have.
I am sorry to say that you are sorry.
Children.
I am the teacher.
We got on, running to the edge of the cliff.
I can’t remember any names.
Are you striving to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I never lie.
I’m a university student.
These publications are available to us.
They do not want us to know that.
It’s not my car.
You received a red light.
I know what I’ve been told to learn.
I miss you very much.
I hear what you say.
I want you to come home.
I go with them.
Give an opportunity.
I am not strong.
Not at all!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do you understand French?
She’s always there for me.
It is to the first one.
Who is this wine?
I have my brother.
They do not spend much time together.
You call me when you need help.
So did I.
We left.
They are not here.
For what purpose?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is coming!
We take them together.
week after week.
I love to see how you prepare.
What do you do?
I am free.
Will they also come?
He knows that we love him.
You can distinguish sheep from goats.
I’ll think about that.
No one listened to me.
I love to learn French.
It seems that we can take us to the beach this end of the week.
Why?
Don’t you come?
You have to return home.
How old is he?
I know.
I Cannot Stop It
She doesn't seem to be happy.
I know where to turn for guidance.
All day long, he goes to work, except for the rain.
Thank you very much!
I do not want to give up.
What is happening below?
I’m going to a concert.
It sounds so good.
I am reading a book.
Do you know what that car is?
I am free.
You are a good student.
Keep that in mind.
I am sure that I found him at another time.
Do you have a minute?
I like to have short hair.
Do you plan to be at the meeting?
