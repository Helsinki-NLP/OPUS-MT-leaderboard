You have to get there.
Why at home?
Asa and my father.
Do not give up.
I am a new person here.
We cannot believe it.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why don’t we go there together?
We Will See Him Again!
Awake!
I have no place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I know he’s there.
You are a good person.
Where is your family?
Better yet, why not try to live a different life?
I’m not hungry.
I am a good student.
I threw away my keys.
We were not alone.
I want you to know that.
I would like to ask you, What do you get out of this relationship?
No one knew what to do.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why not learn French again?
Not necessarily.
I would like to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When does he rise?
Do you know why?
When am I approaching them?
We don’t have any money.
Forgive Me!
I do not need them.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
Very good.
When it does not keep quiet, it is very dangerous.
I lost my pen.
When Do You Rise?
You can pick any color that you like.
He bought all the money.
They don’t have any money.
You are a good parent.
Are you coming?
I want to sell you.
Do you want to support yourself?
I no longer have a head.
If you don’t, come.
This is my father.
That’s what I want to know.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he comes.
I can’t believe it.
He was said to be very rich.
His Word was a miracle.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
He knows no one except his parents.
I was able to do that.
I don’t think he comes.
He was cut off.
The sun is bright in the east.
Why not?
It will be very good.
No problem.
I remember that first.
Do you want to take them with you?
And what is that?
You reject me because I said it.
My brother was not at home.
My parents invited me to stay with them.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
See the picture.
I’m in a car.
What can you do?
Is this your mother?
Why does the sky look blue?
If you don’t, come.
It’s our car.
Nobody here has a car.
Choose for Us!
I don’t know the word.
Light.
I’m glad you are here.
Are you looking for us?
Not at all!
What is the purpose of this arrangement?
I don’t have any privileges.
My daughter will be married in sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand that.
It makes me happy.
Where do you know my name?
Do you want it?
Is It Love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I learned that you are married.
You are on your way, or are you working on it?
In the past, he was a teacher.
Be patient.
I was still alive!
Whom do you think I am?
I have seen that for myself.
You want to find out.
Bribery is a debt.
He is not with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
I think it’s your grief.
Take a taxi to find you in a hotel.
You are not coming, are you?
He is coming!
Not at all.
I do not know how long the delay will continue.
Whose image is this?
Get up?
Be careful!
No one knows what to do.
Do not look at the material below.
I’ll ask her.
We returned.
I’ll see you.
I know a lot about you.
No problem.
I want to learn French.
My car broke down.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is happening.
She has given up her car keys.
Why are you not in my place?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate sheep from goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I’m going to take you to school.
Do I Know Tom?
Does that prospect appeal to you?
May I come back?
That is why I love you.
Who are you?
It was getting hot.
Please give me a copy.
It is to the elders.
It’s too hot.
You know I love you.
This is extremely hot.
Our journey is time.
I accepted the money.
What do you want to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you a new person?
I know what needs to be done.
Are you an avid learner?
Do you have any money?
I don’t know.
I know how it works.
What are these shoes?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is excellent.
Thank you for going back home.
I respect them.
Not at all!
She is strong.
This is $2.50.
I returned home to visit my mother.
They are perfect.
Your leg is dirty.
I hurt you.
Thank you immediately.
Are you an avid learner?
I will give you.
Get drunk.
I want the same things myself.
You are my friend.
What is our car?
No one knows what to do.
What is your basic education?
You don’t want to know!
She is a good student.
I often think about it.
Receive a copy of the book.
I have no home.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I thought.
He is happy.
I became very hungry.
You don’t know.
Look at it this way.
I thought you were going home.
My daughter will be the youngest married.
He was raised by his grandmother.
He did.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my sister.
I put this one to work.
How much time do you want to keep?
Every morning I leave home before two o'clock.
I gave up my comfortable lifestyle.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We can understand.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are my dear wife.
I will be pleased with you.
It is ours.
Where is your family?
Do not say the same things over and over again.
Today, I am going to send it to you.
Where are we going?
I don’t understand why.
You know where I am.
What Is the Purpose of Your Journey?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
Take that car.
I am not good enough.
Do you know what you must do?
We know.
No, thank you.
Where do you want to be?
I love the places I live in.
Do not ask.
Should I open a window?
Few rain trees were felled.
Where are you going?
No matter how excited you are.
You have to go home.
Are they here?
Are you learning French?
You will be rewarded with great repentance.
Please visit me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know how.
There I met my brother.
I know what I am doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I do the same for you.
This girl is dressed like a son.
I do not have my brother.
Sadly, when my older friend moved, he moved to another city.
Your father?
You know I have to go.
It is your book.
It is not my day.
For how long has he been sick?
If he had stayed home that day, he would have been safe.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I am not happy.
I know what is happening.
I know.
Well, right?
I know what you think.
You are hot.
It was not enough that I had to change it.
Better yet, why not try to live a different life?
This girl is dressed like a son.
I like to see you not only as a person but also as a person.
I have to get rid of my hair.
Too little?
My sibling is my brother.
I am glad and rejoice with you.
Do you have time to do something for me?
Turn it off.
I don’t know how to give names.
Do you know what love is?
The marriage occurs on Saturday.
I would not die.
Talk to me about your goal.
Is this book on the table nice?
I lost my pen.
Thank you for coming.
I am a nurse.
Someone is standing behind a wall.
I went to school.
Be realistic.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
Are you a good minister?
When I climbed up the slope, I could hardly believe my eyes.
Is that really so?
We did.
They are children.
Do Not Be Afraid.
Keep in mind, though, that you are reading a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a way.
I go to school too.
I do not have any brother or sister.
I leaned a thimble to my finger.
What do you see?
It’s embarrassing.
Do you know where he is?
What is your father like?
Do not call me over again.
My father is at home.
The drawing is sharp.
Are they Japanese?
Give me a copy.
You are a good person.
The windows are given south.
I couldn’t buy it.
I will go in the day of God.
We can see it.
Where do you come from?
Here we hang them up ourselves.
I don’t know where he lives.
There are a hundred people in a building.
I understand that.
The tooth has no teeth.
Not at all.
My dream had come true.
You can understand.
I am not sure what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I am not a graduate of the university.
Let me see.
Do you belong to us?
Follow the course of goodness toward those who hate you.
Otherwise, things are very different.
They are too small.
The furniture does not exercise today.
We are so happy.
The girl is pretty attractive.
I am coming to see you.
I am not a good carpenter.
You don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I thought you were going home.
I did it for you.
I love your sound car.
Who is your teacher?
Are you here?
Does that prospect appeal to you?
It is worth the effort.
Undoubtedly.
Did I succeed?
I don’t know you.
I’m glad you are there.
I need to feel that I am not a victim.
Let him go on his journey.
Make no mistake about it, though, there is no neutral ground in this matter.
I don’t know what to think.
I don’t know what to do.
What accounts for this?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
Money spent.
I want to buy a car.
I want to leave too.
It’s not right.
When Do You Pursue It?
We laughed.
Hardly!
I threw away my keys.
I do not understand this word.
I don’t care if I even belong to you today.
I am looking for you.
Would you not like to see this house for a very long time?
Your car is a gift to me.
He was said to be very rich.
No one can be certain.
Walk or not?
We don’t.
In ancient times there was a temple.
I know you said that.
Oh, no.
Why not go home?
Do you feel the same way?
I don’t have any privileges.
What do you want to see?
Why Do You Ask?
He is coming!
I don’t have a good time.
I am sure that he is superior to me.
Accept reality.
I know that girl.
They did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Take your schoolwork into account.
I want to accompany you.
I know only his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will be happy with you.
We can understand them.
What is the family like?
My native language is Spanish.
Come on!
How old is he?
I need to know why.
You are not my brother.
My family is relatively small.
Do you know why?
Is he at home?
I love mathematics.
I know.
Otherwise, things are very different.
Nothing happened.
We meet together.
Not at all!
Where was Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where do you find them?
I do not know French well.
When do you go?
They don’t have any money.
Relate what happened.
Is the phone number correct?
Exert yourself.
It is not a horse.
Look at me!
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
They saw him.
Is It Enough to Go?
I don’t care if I even belong to you today.
He nodded.
Do you belong to us?
It is not something to be proud of.
Bracket above!
I love the sound car.
I know where to turn.
Your looks like yours A.
How much is paid?
They are very different.
Not at all!
Where do you want to be?
See it.
Nobody listens to me.
Keep in mind, though, that you are reading a letter.
We are here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes away.
They know us.
When Do You Rise?
I will not give up.
From England.
You reject me because I said it.
Don’t worry about it.
The windows are opened.
You do not have to come.
No one listened.
I have never forgotten them.
I don’t think he comes.
No problem.
The rice is then sold.
I know how it works.
No one asked.
They want us to do so.
What do you see on the outside?
I’m sure you would agree with that.
I shall not be there.
Where was Tom?
Is this French?
The source of these books is my sister.
We can go to work from one day at a time.
We arrived.
I learned French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they are.
It is a wonderful book.
Our weapons are very powerful.
I know your father.
I learned French at school.
You have to go home.
Where have all the people gone?
Can you open the window?
Will you go somewhere else?
Where is my mother?
If not, when?
Is that what you want?
Where is your car?
My father was not at home.
Not at all.
Do you know?
Power.
Are you looking for them?
No wealthy people live here.
In this camp there is a hole in the back of the throat.
He knows her.
I would be glad to see her.
My father was not at home.
Ah no!
What’s a cell phone?
You can sing.
Forgive me, for I am so sorry.
I know exactly how to do it.
We are jealous.
I think you can understand it.
Where are we going?
Love is blind.
Let me explain.
I know you have.
I am not a student.
I’ll try that.
The strong winds blow, and I can’t move fast.
Probably not.
I saw my sister there.
I do not give up.
How much time will you spend on it?
Asa and his father.
What is that?
You have been adopted.
My house is near the place of worship.
He was wrong on a word!
All the dew that falls on the ground will be eaten by pigs.
I couldn’t look.
I don’t want to read them.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they are?
Where do you go at school?
Which one?
What a thought!
He gave it to me.
I never saw him.
And what is that?
We are listening.
Why do people say that?
Rapid carpets are very precious.
I don’t salute the flag.
I do not understand French.
There is no one!
Why do I have to do this?
It is Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a nurse.
How many?
We don’t have any money.
I know you will listen.
Take your shoes away.
I know what you look like.
I was thrilled.
Is the car a new car?
Why don’t you go in?
He did not read the book.
I don’t want to be rich.
You are sorry if I said so.
The animal has no teeth.
That will be joyful.
You can go.
When Do You Go Home?
He did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is new.
He knows her.
She is a French.
I don’t have a car.
Focus on your head.
Why not make what you have in mind?
I want you to see her.
You can use this vehicle.
I don’t know.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see it?
Quite the contrary!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought some eggs and milk.
One batch of papyrus was missing.
I saw her again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was your goal?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
She is a French.
He is a tall son.
I know exactly how they feel.
You know how best to do this.
I have a car.
When will you come to your home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 2: 00 p.m. is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You have to stop drinking.
Be obedient to your mother.
There is a way.
Where did you stop the car?
I am at between one and two hours.
If you have close companions, stop and think.
What shall I wear?
What Is a Book?
The Americans?
How do they look?
Look at me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
That is not the case with you.
Do we get one?
What Is Your Comment?
Is the fault always bad?
Drink.
He is coming!
Would you like to copy it?
I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.
We are joyful.
Keep it tidy and clean.
It makes me feel sick.
I take them.
I’m not hungry.
I understand.
Not necessarily.
I learned French at school.
Why did it happen?
I want you to come home.
Asa and his mother.
Are you looking for me?
Store your mother.
You know I have to go.
Which car?
Do you love him?
We have to place the balance between exit and logins.
The serpent struck home.
They do not know today.
Do you know what you are asking?
Open the Window!
It’s our chance!
This son is his brother.
Why Don’t You Go to School?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I get in?
You know I love you.
Researchers have found on human bones in a cave.
Our journey is timed.
Would I ever see it again?
These steps can prevent the spread of disease.
I’m a factor.
We were told to eat a noon meal together.
Do not give in to rage!
It is not the topic of the conversation. We just go to the movie.
I fell in love with him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am a new person here.
I want to learn French.
I’m going to find you.
I do not have my sister.
I sleep a lot.
I have a briefcase.
The water is clear.
If I knew, I would go.
I have to say what I am thinking.
What Is the Price?
I know where we are.
Why did they not come?
I’ll take my car home.
Why not go to school?
We are students at a university.
I don’t know his name.
I’m too far gone.
How do you go to school?
Forgive Me!
Be patient.
Do not put it off!
Do you know what it is?
You are sorry if I said so.
I know his family.
I know what it is.
I threw away my keys.
This is what I receive.
I don’t have any privileges.
What Is the Purpose of Your Journey?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
I gave birth to my mother tomorrow.
Yes, it does?
We know him.
I need some rest.
No one asked.
We are jealous.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I get up at 1: 00 a.m.
Do not open the window.
Family history.
Why not?
Why the hot?
All day long, she goes to work except in the rain.
It is ours.
Do not look at them.
How does your brother feel about you?
Can We Talk About It?
Where are you going?
I loved this vehicle.
Why do you learn French?
I think so.
I can see them.
I know you will listen.
He accused the man of stealing.
I put this one back in my hand.
I have never heard anything like it.
I don’t know their names.
Let me explain.
I know what to do.
He was said to be very rich.
Your leg is dirty.
Don’t You Want to Be Settled?
Do you like it?
"What's this star's popular?" (" "The player is the Father."
You do not have to thank me.
What did you get up the next evening?
We want you to take it with us.
Asa and his mother.
When we are alone, let us enjoy ourselves.
We came to see you.
Do you want it?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want something to drink?
Do you not know at all, or do you not know at all?
I know what love is.
Not one.
A weapon specially designed to attack is a form of paralysis.
What do you do here?
I’m a factor.
No one is prepared for me.
We were in a classroom.
When?
It made me think.
Do you have any rice rice?
Are they here?
We will find you.
We are brothers and sisters.
I know why you are here.
Why do you study at a university?
And what is that?
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
The next time?
I have broken my hand.
Tell me, if you do know understanding.
Listen to your mother!
Read on.
I will give you.
What information?
They are in my room!
Is this tea strange?
Do you want something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is it bought?
I would like you to read this book.
From Brazil.
I’m going to take you home.
We were in a classroom.
Do not forget us!
I’m going to write it down to us.
Don’t interrupt to justify your actions.
Do you have this money?
They are too small.
It is his job.
That is what you asked for.
She’s my sister.
What are you looking for?
Orders?
He was cut off.
I want to see it.
Stop giving orders here!
Sometimes we go to the cinema together.
Would you not agree?
What have you read?
Where are we going?
Why do we do it?
This is extremely tall.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There is an empty space where before there was a living human.
She’s my sister.
It is his job.
Do you know what they said?
I don’t understand it.
They do not know.
Is he an American?
Scarlet macaw, 5 / 8
What’s going on below?
I’m sorry I lost my apartment.
We are all alone.
I love what I do.
My emotions are stirred for him.
Do you know what he said?
His Word was always at work.
When are you going?
I don't understand such things.
Is this better?
Are they also in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing a lot of our time.
Why not give up?
Come up with an appropriate public talk without being distracted by other languages.
What is his family like?
Magdalena and Anita are best friends.
I am glad and rejoice with you.
We need to eat at least one meal a day together.
Consider one example.
Do you have a brother?
We got together.
I’ll agree with that.
I’ve to think about it.
Where is Mary?
I have a hard time coming to terms with my health.
I must continue.
I’m glad you are here.
Do you think that you are happy?
Why don’t you go with me?
Nobody is at home.
Let me explain.
He came to love her.
She did not get pregnant.
Why didn’t they like me?
How much is left?
What did you give me?
Go out.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
His face was red with anger.
Not at all.
Stork!
I’ll take part.
How many nights?
Yes.
I was introduced to each other.
You have to leave.
Asa and his father.
Well, I’m glad you came along.
Do you know where he is?
I was not happy.
Why don’t you go with me?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
This gift is indeed magnificent.
I thought you were going home.
I do not have any brother or sister.
I don’t know.
I don’t know his names.
Can You Recall?
I do.
Do you know these people?
Is this a desirable right?
Why do I do it?
I’m not sure.
This industry produces motorized vehicles.
I am not a student.
We can only guess.
Do not do that again.
Look in window.
I was not happy.
One batch of papyrus was missing.
Save.
He is happy.
Take a ride in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Are you looking for it?
Remember, your loving - kindness is not to be taken for granted.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We need talks in the language of the day.
So why did you come here?
I don’t understand it.
I went to study.
No one spoke.
We are brothers and sisters.
It’s too hot.
So I did that.
I have to study.
Thank you very much!
He is far from being incomprehensible.
Does that prospect appeal to you?
You are ours.
What was that purpose?
I no longer have one memory.
We are students at a university.
It is not something new.
Yes or No?
Can you enlarge on that?
No one saw it.
I’ll try.
I would like to ask you, Are you hit?
I know that girl.
Which type of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where have you been taken?
No problem.
I am happy.
How many cups did you drink?
Is this office a dangerous place?
The car is a luxury luxury.
We do.
Our arms are outstretched.
We shall find them.
Your interests?
I know you have.
I’m sorry to reprimand your children.
Children.
I am a teacher.
We got on our way down the slope.
Name has been changed.
Do you want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I don’t salute the flag.
I am a university student.
These publications are for us.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You passed by a red light signal.
I know what I am assigned to learn.
I miss you very much.
I understand that.
I want you to come home.
We go together.
Take the initiative.
I am not strong.
There is no one!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do you understand French?
I’ll have to think about it.
It is to the elders.
What is the significance of this wine?
I have my sister.
It does not last long.
When you need help, you invite me.
So did I.
We moved away.
They are not rich here.
What does he want to accomplish?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is coming!
We go there together.
We’ll do that again in the coming week.
I like the way you people dress.
What do you do?
I am the creature.
Do they?
He knows that we love him.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
Nobody listens to me.
I love to learn French.
Perhaps we can take along on the beach this weekend.
Why?
You are not coming, are you?
You have to leave.
How old is he?
I know you.
I’ll never forget
You're not happy.
I know where to turn.
All day long, she goes to work except for the rain.
Thank you very much!
I do not want to give up.
What’s going on below?
I’ll see the game.
They look good.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who the car is?
I am the creature.
You are a good student.
Keep that in mind.
I know I really met her at another time.
Do You Have a Waiting Attitude?
I have short hair, short hair, and short hair.
Do you plan to attend a meeting?
The paint is dull.
Rigidity.
Not at all.
