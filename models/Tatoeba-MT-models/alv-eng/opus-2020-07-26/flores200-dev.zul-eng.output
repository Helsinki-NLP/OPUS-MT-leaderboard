Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small bills in his grandmother through a microscope.

Elements and compartments can be moved from one place to another but cannot change.
Nitrogen as gas still has the same elements as liquid nitrogen. The form of fluid survives but the cells are still the same.
Water for another example. A mixture of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
They can be made up of the same cell whether it is gas, liquid, or solid.

An important feature of this concept is: There is only one correct answer, and there are only two correct answers, one correct and the other.
This kind of thinking is associated with some sort of science or technology.
People with this type of thinking are more rational, able to memorize illustrations, solve problems, and test tests.
