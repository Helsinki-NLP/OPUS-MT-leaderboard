You have to get it.
Why at home?
Asa and his father.
Do not give up.
I am a new person here.
I’m not sure.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why don’t we go there together?
I’ll meet you again!
Awake!
I have no place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I know exactly how I felt about her.
You are a good person.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Better yet, why not try to live a life of ease?
I am not hungry.
I am a good student.
I gave up my keys.
We are not alone.
I want you to know that.
May I ask, What do you get from it?
No one knew what to do.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why didn’t you learn French?
Not necessarily.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When do you get up?
Do you know why?
For what time am I now living?
We don’t have any money.
Forgive me!
I do not need them.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
Very good.
Not only is it brighter but it also cools up.
I lost my pen.
When do you get up?
You can find any trace of it by heart.
She had prepared all the flour.
They don’t have any money.
You are a good parent.
Come or us?
I want to save it.
Do you want riches?
I no longer have a head.
If you do not hear, they will come.
He is my father.
I’m curious.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he comes.
I can’t understand it.
He is considered to be very rich.
His Word was awesome.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows him well except his parents.
I was able to do that.
I don’t think he comes.
He was cut off.
The sun is setting on the east.
Why not?
It will be very good.
There is no problem.
I remember that first.
Do you want to?
What else is his name?
You avoid me because I have spoken it.
My brother was not at home.
My parents invited me to stay with them.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
See the picture.
I’m in a car.
What can you do?
Is this your mother?
Why does heaven look like a blue sky?
If you don’t wait, they come.
Our car.
Nobody here has a car.
Choose for Us!
I don’t know the word.
Light.
I’m glad you are here.
Are you looking for us?
Not at all!
What is the purpose of this program?
I don’t have any rights.
My daughter will be married in the sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you are saying.
It makes me happy.
Where do you know my name?
Do you want to?
Kindness — Is It Out of Control?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are 12 months of the year.
I have a question.
I learned that you are married.
Are you going?
In the past, he was a teacher.
You got it.
I stood there!
Do you view me as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
I’ve seen this for myself.
You want to find out.
Pride is a basic human need.
He is not on your side.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want to drink something?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
I thought it was your pain.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
“ You’re not going, aren’t you?
He is coming!
He is incapable of being dull.
I don’t know how long I will continue.
Whose image is this?
Back?
Not at all!
Nobody knows what to do.
Do not look at the material below.
I’ll ask him.
We returned.
I’ll look at you.
I know a lot about you.
There is no problem.
I want to learn French.
My car broke down.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is happening.
He left the key to his car.
Why are you not at home?
Can I see it again?
Can you tell the difference between the sheep and the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I’m going to take you to school.
Do I Know Tom?
Does that prospect warm your heart?
May I come back?
That is why I love you.
Your own?
It will be warm.
Please give me a copy.
It is toward the outside world.
It is too hot.
You know I love you.
This is a very warm bed.
The answer depends on time.
I made money.
What do you want to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you a new person?
I know what needs to be done.
Do you enjoy studying?
Do you have any money?
I don’t know.
I know how to do this.
What are these?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is beautiful.
You killed us at home.
I respect them.
Not at all!
She is strong.
This is $2.50.
I returned home to my mother.
It is perfect.
Your safety is at stake.
I hurt you.
Thank you very quickly.
Do you enjoy studying?
I will give you.
Get drunk.
I want the same things.
You are my friend.
What is our car?
Nobody knows what to do.
What is your school?
You are not interested in it!
He is a good student.
I often think about it.
Receive a copy of the book.
I’m not at home.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I thought.
He is joyful.
I was hungry.
You don’t know.
Keep your eyes open.
I wish you were home.
My daughter is about to divorce.
He was raised by his grandmother.
He did.
I want to leave.
They do not know.
I have my sister.
The robe was a ring that I made.
How much time do you want to keep it?
I am leaving home about two o'clock in the morning.
I threw away my toys.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We can understand.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are a beloved wife to me.
I would like that.
It is ours.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Do not say the same things over and over again.
Now I’m going to send it back.
Where are we going?
I don’t understand why.
You know where I am.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
Stop the car.
I am not good enough.
Do you know what to do?
We know.
No, not at all.
Where would you like to be?
I love the environment in which I live.
Don’t ask.
Should I just go to the window?
A few drops of rain.
Where are you going?
No matter how excited you are, you are.
You have to go home.
Will he be here?
Are you learning French?
You will deepen your repentance.
Visit me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know how.
There I met my sister.
I know what I am doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I do the same for you.
This girl wears herself like a son.
I do not have my brother.
Sadly, my older friend moved to another city.
Your father?
You know I have to go.
It is your publication.
It is not my day.
How long does he continue to get sick?
If he had remained home that day, there would have been no disasters.
He spoke not only English but also German.
I am not happy.
I know what is happening.
I know.
Good, no?
I know what you think.
He is jealous.
It was not enough that I had to change it.
Better yet, why not try to live a life of ease?
This girl wears herself like a son.
I love to make sure that you are clean.
I have to get rid of my hair.
Too little?
My owner is my brother.
I am happy and have inner joy.
Do you have time to respond to that need?
Let him feel the consequences.
I do not know how to give names.
Do you know what love is?
There will be Saturday.
I would not die.
State your objective.
What is the unique setting of this new publication?
I lost my pen.
Thank you for coming.
I am a cook.
There is a man standing behind the wall.
I quit school.
Be assured that you are right.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
Are you a good worker?
After I climbed out of the valley, I am in a coma.
Is that true?
We did.
They are children.
How Can You Help a “Prodigal ” Child?
Keep in mind that you have received a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a way.
Here I go to school too.
I don’t have my sister.
I also pressed on to my finger.
What do you see?
It’s shameful.
Do you know where he is?
Where is your father?
Do not call me over again.
My father is at home.
The climb was well worth the effort.
Are they Japanese?
He gave me a copy of the book.
You are a good person.
The windows are southern.
I forgot to buy some bread.
I will go on the day of God.
I don’t see it.
Where do you come from?
You are on your own — isolated.
I don’t know where he lives.
There are about a hundred people in a room.
I understand that.
The gum line has no teeth.
Not likely.
My dream has proved true.
You can understand.
I am not sure what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I’m not a university student.
Let me see.
Ours?
Provide fine things in the sight of those who hate you.
With the exception of the word, there is no distinction.
They are too small.
The stork does not quite work today.
We are so happy.
She was strikingly beautiful.
Please visit me.
I’m not a perfect carpenter.
You don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I wish you were home.
I did it for you.
I love your vehicle.
Who is your teacher?
Are you ready to go?
Does it warm your heart?
It is worth the effort.
There is no question about that.
Was it worth it?
I’m not sure.
I’m glad you are there.
I need to feel that I need to be treated that way.
I’ve given up on you.
Do not be judgmental, and you may have to draw the wrong conclusion.
I don’t know what to think.
I don’t know what to do.
What accounts for this?
Where am I?
Her name?
Money was gone.
I want to buy a car.
I want to leave.
She was wrong.
What is your hour?
We broke down.
Not at all!
I gave up my keys.
I do not understand this word.
I don’t care which of you I belong to today.
I’m looking for you.
Can you find it in my house?
I love your vehicle.
He is considered to be very rich.
No one can be certain.
Walking or not?
We don’t.
There was a temple in ancient times.
I know you said that.
Oh, roe.
Why not go home?
Do you feel the same way?
I don’t have any rights.
What do you want to see?
Why Do You Ask?
He is coming!
I don’t have a happy day.
I think he’s great.
Respond in kind.
I know that girl.
They did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Fulfill your schoolwork.
I want to accompany you.
I know only his name.
Asa and his mother.
I’ll be happy with you.
We do not know.
What is the family like?
My native language is Spanish.
Keep in Step!
How old is he?
I need to know the reasons.
You are not my sister.
My family is small.
Do you know why?
Is she home?
I love mathematics.
I know.
With the exception of the word, there is no distinction.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
March
Where was Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you find them?
My French is not what I know.
When do you go?
They don’t have any money.
Relate what happened.
Is the phone number correct?
Rest assured that you do.
It is not French.
Look at me!
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
Let them see.
Does It Need All Travel?
I don’t care which of you I belong to today.
He nodded.
Ours?
It is not presumptuous.
Above!
I love this vehicle.
I know where to turn.
Yours is the same as A.
How much is paid?
It is simply different.
It is out of place!
Where would you like to be?
Keep your eyes open.
Nobody listens to me.
Keep in mind that you have received a letter.
We are here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
“ Take your shoes away.
They know us.
When do you get up?
I do not give up.
From Britain.
You avoid me because I have spoken it.
Stop complaining about me.
The windows are open.
You do not have to come.
No one listened.
I have never forgotten them.
I don’t think he comes.
There is no problem.
This is what the rice cooks need.
I know what is done.
No one asked.
They want us to do so.
What do you see outside?
I’m not sure you enjoy it.
I shall not be there.
Where was Tom?
Is this French?
The author is my sister.
We can take you to work tomorrow.
We arrived.
I learned French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they are.
It is a wonderful book.
Our defenses are weak.
I know your father.
I learned French at school.
You have to go home.
Where have all the people gone?
Can You open the window?
Will you go into this summer?
Where is my mother?
Not now, when?
Is that what you are looking for?
Where Is Your Car?
My father was not at home.
There is no question about that.
Do you know?
Siblings.
Are you looking for them?
No wealthy person is here.
There is a bullet in the tip of the cane.
He knows her.
I would like to see her again.
My father was not at home.
No, indeed!
What’s the telephone?
You can sing a song.
Show me just how sorry you feel!
I know exactly how to do this.
We are jealous.
I think you can grasp that.
Where are we going?
Love is blind.
Let me explain.
I know you have.
I am not a student.
I’ll try.
The strong winds are blowing, and I am unable to move faster.
Probably not.
There I saw my sister.
I do not give up.
How much time will you devote to it?
Asa and his father.
What is that?
You have been given a copy.
My house is next to the place of worship.
He was betrayed!
All the elephants that fall to the ground will be eaten by pigs.
I couldn’t see.
I don’t want to read them.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
What is it?
What a thought!
He gave it to me.
I never saw him.
What is it?
We do not give out.
Why do people say that?
The map would be of great value.
I have vowed to do so.
I do not understand French.
There is no one!
Why do I have to do this?
It’s Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a cook.
How many?
We don’t have any money.
I know that you are listening.
“ Take your shoes away.
I know what you are doing.
I was happy.
Is this car a new one?
Why don’t you join them?
He did not read the book.
I don’t want to be rich.
You are sorry if I said it.
The crocodile has no teeth.
That will be joyful.
You can.
When do you go home?
He did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is by no means new.
He knows her.
She is a French.
I don’t have a car.
Pay attention to your head.
Why not make a mental or a written agreement?
I want you to see her.
You can use this vehicle.
I don’t know.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Stop saying that!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought some eggs and milk.
One sheet was missing.
I saw her again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was that purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I will be in my car.
I don’t like running.
She is a French.
He is a tall son.
I know exactly how they feel.
You know how well you do.
I have a car.
When Will You Come to Your Home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 7: 00 p.m. is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You should stop drinking.
Be kind to your mother.
There is a way.
Where did you stop the car?
I am at between one and two hours.
If you have freeness of speech, stop and direct yourself.
Should I Wear a T - shirt or a Shave?
What Is a Book?
The Americans?
What do they look like?
Look at me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not according to your opinion.
Will we meet them?
What are your needs?
Is the wrong done?
Drink.
He is coming!
I’m not sure
I will step on such.
We are happy.
Keep it quiet and up - to - date.
I don’t have any self - respect.
I do.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not necessarily.
I learned French at school.
Why?
I want you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do you want me?
Keep it out of your mother’s sight.
You know I have to go.
Which car?
Do you love him?
We have to specify an balance between exiting and logins.
The serpent struck down the pangs of death.
They do not know today.
Do you know what to ask?
Open the window!
It’s our turn!
This son is his brother.
Why don’t you go to school?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I get in?
You know I love you.
Researchers have found the bones of a man in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see them again?
These measures can help to prevent the spread of disease.
I’m a factor.
We were told to eat a meal in the afternoon.
Do not get angry!
It is not the end of the conversation. We simply go into the movie.
I liked him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am a new person here.
I want to learn French.
I’m going to pick you up.
I do not have my sister.
I sleep a lot.
I have a purse.
The water is clear.
If I knew, I would walk away.
I express what I think.
What Is the Price?
I know where we are.
Why Did They Come?
I must drive my car.
Why not attend class?
We were students at a university.
I don’t know his name.
I have a dream.
How do you go to school?
Forgive me!
Keep it simple.
Of course not!
Do you know what it is?
You are sorry if I said it.
I know his family.
I know what that is.
I gave up my keys.
This is what I do.
I don’t have any rights.
What is the reason for your visit?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
Tomorrow I get pregnant.
Yes, it does?
We know him.
I need a little rest.
No one asked.
We are jealous.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I get up at one o’clock in the morning.
Do not open the window.
Consider your own experience.
Why not?
Why the hot?
Unless it is raining, she goes to work each day.
It is ours.
Do not look below.
How does she feel about him?
Can we make a defense?
Where have you taken us?
I loved this vehicle.
Why do you learn French?
I think so.
I’ve found them.
Here is your copy.
He accused the man of stealing.
I carried this package with me.
I did not listen.
I don’t know their names.
I am speaking to move you to your goal.
I know what to do.
He is considered to be very rich.
Your safety is at stake.
Don’t you agree with the German attitude?
Do you?
"What's that's more common?" ( "He who created it is the Father."
You do not have to thank me.
What happened next in the evening?
We want it to be a place where we carry it.
Asa and his mother.
As individuals, we have the responsibility to enjoy life.
We came to see you.
Do you want to?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want to drink something?
You are not aware of what has happened, do you?
I know what love is.
Not one.
The reaper fights off.
What Do You Do Here?
I’m a factor.
Nobody is prepared for me.
We were taught in one school.
How long?
It made me think.
Do you have any rice?
Will he be here?
We will find them.
We are brothers and sisters.
I know why you are here.
Why did you study at a university?
What is it?
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
When will you come home?
I have run.
Take pride in learning to do things well.
Listen to your mother!
Read on.
I will give you.
What are the facts?
They are in my room.
Is the tea strange?
Do you want to drink something?
I am the youngest.
How much is paid?
I would like to read this book.
From Brazil.
I am coming to you with you.
We were taught in one school.
Do not forget us!
I wrote to us.
Do not give up hope.
Do you have this cash?
They are too small.
It is his job.
That is what you asked for.
She’s my sister.
What do you look for?
Shopping?
He was cut off.
I want to find out.
Stop giving orders here!
Sometimes we went to the cinema together.
Would you not agree?
What did you read?
Where should we look?
Why do we do it?
This is too tall.
Do you believe that he does not care about me?
There were gaps — missing pieces — in his pocket.
She’s my sister.
It is his job.
Do you know what they said?
I don’t understand it.
They do not know.
The American?
A coffee or a tea?
What was going on here?
I am sorry to say that I have left you.
We are alone.
I love what I do.
My voice stops because of an argument.
Do you know what he said?
His Word was eternal.
When are you about to leave?
I don't understand such things.
Is this better?
Are they also in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing a lot of time.
Why not give up?
Enter a suitable discourse without being distracted by other languages.
What is her family?
Magdalena and Anita are best friends.
I am happy and have inner joy.
We should eat supper together.
Consider one example.
Do you have a brother?
We went home together.
I’ll agree with that.
I’ll have to think about that.
Where is Mary?
I still feel the pain.
I have to finish working with you.
I’m glad you are here.
Can you imagine how happy you are?
Why don’t you go too?
Nobody is at home.
Let me explain.
He did.
She did not get pregnant.
Why Don’t They Like Me?
How large is it?
What did you give me?
Go outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
His face was red with anger.
Not likely.
Stork!
I’ll take part.
How many nights?
We will be.
I began to smile back.
You have to leave.
Asa and his father.
You are told to accompany me.
Do you know where he is?
I was not happy.
Why don’t you go too?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
This gift is indeed excellent.
I wish you were home.
I don’t have my sister.
I don’t know.
I don’t know them.
Can You Recall?
I’m sorry.
Do you know who these people are?
Is this a popular right?
Why do I do it?
I’m not sure.
This industry produces motorized vehicles.
I am not a student.
Yes, we do.
Do not do that again.
Look in Window.
I was not happy.
One sheet was missing.
He acquired money.
He is joyful.
Stay in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Do you want to find it?
Remember that your kindness is something you have forgotten about.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We want presentations in the language of the day.
So why have you brought me here?
I don’t understand it.
I went to study.
No one spoke.
We are brothers and sisters.
It is too hot.
So I did that.
“ I have to study.
Thank you very much!
It matters to him.
Does that prospect appeal to you?
You are ours.
What was that purpose?
I have no livelihood left.
We were students at a university.
There is nothing new.
Are you?
Can you enlarge on that?
Not one word of them has failed.
I’ll try.
I would like to ask you, Do you have an ax?
I know that girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where have you been?
There is no problem.
I love to.
How many cups did you drink?
What is the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
The car is a fine one.
We do.
Our defenses are weak.
We shall find ourselves there.
Your report?
I know you have.
I’m sorry to apologize.
Children.
I am a teacher.
We were able to get up and walk down a path that took us to the beach.
Name has been changed.
Do you want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I am not good at all.
I’m a university student.
These publications are for us.
They do not want us to know that.
It’s not my car.
You passed by a red light mark.
I know what I’m going to learn.
I love you very much.
I understand that.
I want you to come home.
We’re all going together.
Give yourself a chance.
I am not strong.
There is no one!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do you understand French?
He gives me time to think.
It is toward the outside world.
What is the Memorial cup of wine?
I have my sister.
It does not keep account of the injury.
When you need help, you invite me.
So did I.
We moved away.
They are not wealthy here.
Why does he want to happen?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is coming!
We go there together.
We will be back within a week.
I like to watch how you prepare.
What do you do?
That’s for me.
Do they too come?
He knows that we love you.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll think about that.
Nobody listens to me.
I love to learn French.
Perhaps we could take along the coast this latter week.
Why do they do it?
“ You’re not going, aren’t you?
You have to leave.
How old is he?
I know you.
I’m not sure
He doesn't seem to be happy.
I know where to turn.
Unless it falls to the wind, he goes to work all day long.
Thank you very much!
I don’t want to give up.
What was going on here?
I’ll see a toy.
They look good.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who the car is?
That’s for me.
You are a good student.
Forget about that.
I am sure that I saw him in another location.
Do you have any minutes?
I have short hair.
Do you plan to attend the meeting?
The mirror’s unpolished face was usually left unadorned.
Vulnerability.
