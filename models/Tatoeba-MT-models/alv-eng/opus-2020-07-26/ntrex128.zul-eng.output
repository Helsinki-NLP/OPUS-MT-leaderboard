Ringers had been hit with a stick, but it was.
Or they do well under Gerard, giving up those standards.
Their final drills will be done - Once they have opened the home’s nest - Ringers must rise from the eggs, as they find them in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reception at Cologne
They were at the fasts and the sky blue on Saturday (the day 29) as the Turkish and German conductor gathered in Berlin for breakfast.
The last day of this questionable visit was by President Erdogan at Germay - / Let’s set out to arrange for an association between NATO and its friends.
There have been debate over such issues as human rights, freedom of journalists, and the leaving of the U.S.
Erdogan is going to Cologne to open up a new big museum.
The city is home to many of the Turks besides Turkey.
Police have reported safety conditions as they have prevented more than 25,000 people from standing before the mosque, but more and more rebels have come to see their president.
A thousand anti-Courages with Erdogan-most of them are kurdish-and they want their words to be heard, which is in harmony with the Erdogan law and the German government now accept him into the country.
This issue shows the difference between ideas about a visitor who is seen as a hero to the German Turks and who as a hero is opposed to others.

Once West: you changed his position to Himself.
The fo'c'sle Kane West changes its name - Ye.
To announce the change on Saturday, he wrote: "You are known as One.
West, at age 41, has been called a racking name at some time and used moniker as the title of his eighth album, published in June.

The AMSO in Mexico does not want to use war against citizens
Mexico’s President Andrew Manuel Lopez Opador has promised that he will not use a military force against citizens as this country draws close to 50 years of blood attack against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza "Never use soldiers to oppress Mexicans."
Police were drawn to the peaceful presentation of aplaza on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at that time when the movement of lead students was concentrated throughout Latin America.
Lopez Observatory has promised to support the young Mexicans by providing full - time services to those who are studying and opening many public universities free of charge.
He says that unemployment and illiteracy attract youths to crime.
U.S. must increase the support of A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., the U.S. should double the number using research in the field, says financial and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
States from after the various sides of the U.S. government made an announcement at AI, just as the general U.S. plan is not organized with an AI plan.
In the meantime, China started its program last year: it intended to absorb .1 on AI in 2030.
"AI research assignment will be a good start, for all other countries are still too far behind the U.S., and we want to achieve the next success in AI," says Lee.
Conflict with financial support may multiply the chances of the greater achievement of AI in the U.S., and Lee has told CNNBC on the discussion of this week.
Lee, her book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Sinnonance Ventures Director, who has planted one of the most important AI companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980 ’ s he worked in Carnegie Mellon University in a new AI program that is the most public American Othell player, and later he became the leader of the Microsoft Research and the director of China’s Google branch office
Lee accepted the previous U.S. technical competition as the Robotics Challenge Department of Paper and asked when the next would be, to help identify the following industry.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to overcome government policies, says Lee.
"There is no China which removes educational leaders; they are companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical firms have used lights from the universities to work on AI years later.
Lee said that the changes in the migration goal can also help in the U.S. to intensify their plans for AI.
"I think the blue cards should be automatically operated on PhDs to AI," he says.
The Chinese Council of China has issued to improve Procedural Intelligence Development of the Next Generation Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation has poured money out to people at educational centers such as the National Science Foundation and other research agencies, but the professional profession is small in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year. The Defense Department has established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to unite the department and the academics, and the White House has announced the formation of a special cup of Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA has announced $2.6 million in a program called AI Net.
The NSF, has grown to $100 million a year in an AI survey.
Meanwhile, the American Constitution of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not yet been valid.
The Macedonians decide whether to change the name of the land or not.
The Macedonians have voted on Sunday to change the country's name into the Republic of North Macedonia, a bomb to resolve a conflict with the Greek nation that has claimed the sovereignty of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its state, goes on to say that their neighbors on the north side of their route seek their place and want to enter the O NATO and EU.
Both governments agree on the proposed name, but some say that changing the term means lowering the traditional beliefs of the Macedonians into Slavonic
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not agree and that protesting for votes makes the 50 percent of the people who would arrive until the project was legitimate.
The question on the vote board reads: "You agree with the membership of NATO and EU by a Greek agreement."
Supporters of the name, according to Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is what you now pay for insubordination such as EU and Nato in Macedonia, other countries that are brought about by the breakup of Yugoslavia
"I came yesterday to vote in our country’s sas, so that Macedonian youths will live well under the European Union's umbrella because it describes all our complete health," says Oliverra Georgjovska, 79, Skopje.
Regardless of the method or methods you would like to use, it is not up - to - date.
The change would require two thirds of all the provisions for a parliamentary joint joint.
The country’s election commission says that there were no reports of a difference of 1 p.m.
Yet, it has always been 16 percent, with 34 percent previous parliamentary votes for 2016 when 66 percent of the voters signed their votes.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, voter in the city, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted deendum in Macedonia by changing the name of the country to join the NATO and European Union in Strucca, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavararkov, 54, was preparing the stadium and sitting in front of the tents set up by those who were to resist rasendum.
"We may have NATO and EU, but we want to join the head, not through the service door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor world, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as in Macedonia, we can convert others as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia development.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will bring necessary investment in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 percent of the unemployed.
"I believe that the majority of our citizens will weep with EU and NATO," says Zaev after the vote.
He said "Yes" the results "are the certainty of our future."
The envelope was printed in Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research and said between 30 and 43 percent of voters to participate – under expected.
Another police official, who is affected by Macedonia's Telma TV, has received 57 percent of the respondents who plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent claim to be vote.
In order for the latter to be successful, I had 50 percent to one vote.
A failure on the headendum will present a major problem for the pro-Western government that took a long time in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the wall of all Brghton to capture
Sergio Aguero and Nieem Sterling struck down the Brghton wall in the conquest of Manchester City on 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero has made it much easier in his 65 - minute article.
The Argentine gland is pushed into the stomach at the beginning of the plan.
He plows through three of Brghton’s three guards, before passing through the court.
Aguero found herself surrounded by four green rings.
He throws one of the halter before passing a pile of others into Brghton’s box.
Then she cries to the left, finding Sterling.
The front player has just touched the ball in the box to bring it back to Aguero, who used his right-to-right brush to win the Brghton sticker Matthew Ryan with the article on the left side of the net.
"Aguero is still facing problems in his feet," Christian administrator Pep Guardiola tells the media.
"We talked to him about playing for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That’s what happened.
We have had a good time to take the crown in it for a short time."
But it was Sterling that gave the Sky Blues space at the beginning of the Premire League circle.
The wheel appeared in 29 minutes.
Aguero found a ball in Brighton's nose on that game.
He sent the ball with a good look on his left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sande said to touch it before leading Sterling towards the pole.
The Sky Blues have caught the ball in a can almost going outside.
City rivals Hoffenheim to the Champions League in a game that will be playing at 12:5 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon in Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in Spoiler facing one another. Then Rockies
The National Group has been removed in the plastic oroff competition, and there was no more reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who is in line with the challengeer, wishes to enter the stadium on Sunday to face Colorado Rockies, this may end when Rockies face problems on the platforms, and conquer one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the West and NL.
Rockies still hold a single wald-card song for victory at 5-2 when it has long faced the Nationals on Friday day, but they are still looking to hold their first hard disk.
"Where there's no player, however, it remains that once it has arrived in the Denver system of its followers and one group will be playing at the highest level this year.
What could make me avoid playing there?
The Nationals are not the publishers to play on Sunday, but they seem to allow Scherzer to enter the contest.
Scherzer, who may have joined 34, had a bullpen bell on Thursday and will be throwing on Sunday his vacation.
This Washington right-hand operator has 2.53 ERA and 220 strikeouts in 2/3 in the case.
Trump broadcast in West Virginia
The president has finished his talk in the context around his choice of Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court when he stressed the importance of the leaving of the Republicans to the internal election and leadership.
"All we have done is in the flesh in November.
Five weeks before the most important choices in our health.
This is one of the greatests, especially -- I'm not running, but you can say I'm running so full of all places in fighting for the best chairmans," according to him.
Trump has continued, "You see this shocking, shocking group of nonviolent Democrats, that is what you now see.
And they are determined to return to power in any way they can get it, only to look at the cruelty, the uncleanness.
They don't care who hurt them, nor who should give them power over them, that they may have power over them, and that they may have power over them, and that he will not give us."
Democrats, according to him, are in a campaign of "Regultation and disruption."
"But if you look on these four days," he says, "that calls the Democracys "no more than these four days";
He then refers to the Senate Legal Committee that calls Sen. Democratic Democraticne Feinstein, which draws water from the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Enlarge the document?
Ah, here I am.
No, but I said that his one stand didn't tell me the good news that I haven't seen a man’s stand with such a plan."
The crew is no longer a congregation of anyone else.
They no longer speak in their mind’s eye.
When the Momentum nuns in our group forced me to close my mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But then, I have later joined the UN team of workers who were told that they are not acceptable — simply because of the speech of our thoughts.
My next member of Parliament Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because of opposing the Semics.
In my case, those who did not want me to be silenced criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the point of the importance of a system of economics considered, national security, Europe, and other startling factors Jeremiah has had to compete with other leaders before.
In a declaration of the Nottingham East staff group for the Friday convention, the "We want the meetings to be impartial and fun."
For nearly a double year, I am the P of our staff group, the GC Friday's Friday conferences have been a thing of the past.
Sad to say, I now do not go as usual assemblies and the ‘ sympathetic, gentle ’ political promise has long been forgotten if, indeed, ever.
It is becoming increasingly evident that differing views are no longer accepted in the Labor Committee and that views were judged on whether they were acceptable to the group leaders.
This starts just after Jeremy became a leader, and my siblings who said that we have the same political views have also looked to me to take sides that I would not agree with — whether for national security or in a private EU market.
Whenever I speak to the public, it’s no longer important and I’m not going to come up with a mob of harassment on the Internet and say that I’m being disfellowshipped, it destroys politics without complaining, that I’m not supposed to be part of the gang.
And I am not alone in this experience.
Of course, I know that I have been better off than my own, because the talks referred to to to to me are still political.
I’ve yet suspected that my siblings still hold their hands in their work and will not recognize themselves in the face of racial or ethnic prejudice.
One of the most discouraging elements of this political era is the epidemic of abuse that has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said that last week Labour Party must establish a tradition of restrictions.
The fact is that we no longer see the great church and distrustful of it or the changing of the laws of the changing group.
I have had much counsel for the past two years to be urged to slow down, not to speak too much, and it will be "I'm ready."
But I am not involved in politics.
Since I had met Labour for the past 32 years as a student, I was upset by the government Thatcher’s firm for leaving the corrupt school department, wanting to bring the best public services to those who needed them — perhaps as a local government or as a government minister.
I have never been involved in politics, including the last choice.
No one in the Nottingham East can in any way be confused about the law of my position and the positions of modern leadership.
For those who have missed a trip on Friday, all I can say is that when the world moves forward to Brexit will benefit the householders, our businesses, and our public service, I do not wish to spend my time and energy sincerely with the Master of the Labor Party.
But I really do have one message I have in Nottingham Momentum, to non-integration, whether members of the Labor: I cut off by serving you and also promise that there will be no threat or political means that will prevent me from making what I believe will be better for you all.

Ayr has 38-17 Melrose: Ayr never split up the upper floor
Two recent tries have improved the final results, but Ayr is no doubt worthy of praise for the modern best Tenent's Premiership game.

Our family had returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow flash after crossing Cli with no ball, except for the pencil line, MacPerson touched the Ayar.
Lli entered, as you did at the beginning, after Kyle Rowe meets David Armstrong's ball that sends David Armstrong to the family side of the fifth star.

‘ Sea is ours: Bolivian officials hope that the court will open the Pacific road
The crews of the ringing-clad main and La Paz.
The weather plants raise the flag ore-blue.
Naval was from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon with the inscription: "The sea is my right.
Recovery is our responsibility.
In all parts of Bolivia, memories of coasline lost in Chile in the 19th century are still clear – as you look forward to going to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes are perhaps based on your age, and Bolivia is waiting to be ruled by a world court for repairs on Friday, 5th.
" Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and subjection, and it is, in fact, waiting for the exit," says Roberto Calzadilla, who speaks for Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch the CJ ruling on large screens everywhere, with great hope that the Hague court will reap Bolivia's cry that – after talks that extended years – Chile has been forced to negotiate a conversation by giving Bolivia control over the sea.
Evo Morales, a qualified president of Bolivia – who faces a long competition with choice and who next year-- has much to do with Monday.
"is very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," which promises toward the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is less likely to reap Bolivia’s harvest — and that name will change if it agrees.
The Netherlands-based on a UN body that has the ability to register the parts of Chile, affirming that it can never be eliminated by the effect of talks.
That the ICJ rulings came only six months after the debate was heard that the subject was "not difficult," said the international law observer of Chile, Paz Zárate.
Not far from being fulfilled in Bolivia's purposes, the past four years may have taken them back.
"The question of allowing sea use is adopted by the Bolivian authorities," says Zarate.
Morales' violent speech hinders the colliding of Chile's cooperation, so he put it.
Bolivia and Chile will for some time continue the discussions, but it will be very difficult to continue reasoning after this.
Two countries have not changed with delegates since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in Hague, has dismissed the charges that the court is too quick to make a decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new period of relationship with Chile" and the opportunity "to establish 139 years of agreement for the benefits of both countries", and so put it.
Calzidilla will also deny that Meorals – is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used sea issue as a basis for politics.
" Bolivia will never abandon its turn to use the Pacific Ocean."
"Declaration is the possibility that it seems we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that the surrender to nuclear weapons will not happen unless they are able to trust the American.
North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not stop armed with nuclear weapons unless they trust in Washington.
Ri was talking about Saturday at a conference of United Nations.
She appealed to America to follow her promises at the Singapore conference that was among rival leaders.
His observations until the time of America. Country secretary Mike Pompeii looks on the first three months after Singapore and Kim Jon Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is an unrealistic dream that a continuing vaccine and a U.S. shortage of a U.S. peace treaty in Korea has caused North Korea to fall.
Washington is very careful that he does not agree to make Pyongang announcements before he begins to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S. / American President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
However, there is a growing trend that Pyongang is determined to give up weapons that the world may view as the only way to safety.
Poppeo plans to visit Pyongdang the next month to prepare for the second conference of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows a lot of clothing on the head that comes to stores near you
If you want to extend your hats or turn off the sun altogether, you will no longer look far.
tailors Valentino and Thom Browne have produced a list of large head hats in their S19 hole in the Paris Fashion Week presentation.
Unconventionable hats are filled in Instagram this summer, and the weavers bring eye - appealing displays.
The highlights of Valentino have been a long hat on the sides of a dust that has feathers and a diagonal head of the wearer.
Some of the larger sizes include jewelry, a hat of witches.
Thom Browne has revealed rare face masks in the time of Halloween.
Most masks close to the mouth look like Hannibal Lectter rather than the designers.
Another medium - sized life jacket consists of breathing and harbours.
If you continue to pursue a fad that is not well - known, you can become a victim.
The fashion world suspects that large hats may be on the way to large rows of stores.
A large hat is soon followed by I 'La Bomba', a similar hat that can be equal to two feet to open in this sun - blocking, visible in Rihanna's "everyone" to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of the unconquered hat that is popular on the communications pages sent some goods to the exhibit-a life bag about the same as the swimmer was shown.
A dark orange bag made of a raffia tree was finished, dressed in white skin in the hold, going alone to the ‘ Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 show show in Paris.
The well-known wearer Luke Armamitage tells FEMAIL ‘ I expect to see large hats and sea bags arriving at major stores in this coming version; as designers have a great influence on designers will be more difficult to recognize the need to do more than is necessary.'
John Edward: The art of ice is important to the inhabitants of the continent.
The private schools in Scotland keep a record of good results, and this has continued in the year 2018 with other good results, guaranteed only by the success of individual and fellow sports, art, music, and other social efforts.
With a drinking number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to provide the best help.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education levels, as well as in the field they choose as citizens in the country.
As an educational department that can organize and start a special educational program, we see modern fields continue to be famous and popular as a school - age class.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man about the air he hears, what you say is right to his head."
If you talk to him about his dew, what you say reaches your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we will not always rely on the English if we want to establish contact and trust with people of other nations.
From the results of testing the results of this year’s tests, we can see that the most high - quality boilers are being achieved in private schools.
There were sixty-eight of all the students who had learned the foreign fields, receiving the upper part of A.
Signs, gathered from seventy and four SCIS schools, indicate that seventy percent of the students received High Class A from Mandarin, since the other seventy-two percent who read German, sixty-9 percent of those who were French students and another sixty-three percent who also learned Spanish A.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as important skills for children, and young people no doubt will need them in the future.
It now stands as a subject from which you can choose, being considered the same as the principal courses (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Eploymony and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons for the employers ’ rendering up to 17 percent (17 percent per cent) were made by a lack of linguistic skills.
So in particular, the ability to speak is vital in preparing young people for employment opportunities.
With the many expected functions I measure up to, these skills are vital in a united world.
No matter what field a person takes, if they read the second, they put themselves in a better position in the future to develop this skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign lands puts one in front of another.
According to a UK survey of more than 4000 adults (4,000) in 2013, 7 and 5 percent were unable to speak well of foreign climates (75 percent) and to have good communication and French is the only one 1 percent raised by a population of two, fifteen percent.
Neither agriculture is important for today’s children.
Having more climates you know, especially those of developing lands, will help lower children’s opportunities for better employment.
In Scotland school and school differs from one language to another.
Most of the schools focus on teaching fields that are old and modern, while others teach the most important in the UK in regard to the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s preferences, there are many types of ice you can choose from private schools, feeding inexperienced ones in the area.
The Scotland private schools are committed to provide a form of education to prepare children and to give children the skills they need to succeed, the future holds them.
At present, there can be no denying, in the business world around the globe, that the fields will continue to play an important role in the future of the world, so I must be exposed to education.
In fact, modern fields must be included in the "international communications skills."
The private schools will continue to offer this opportunity, variety, and intelligence to the young Scots.
You have to do the right thing.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

The Trump election in Wheeling, West Virginia will start at seven o'clock in the evening. At T, Saturday, 29 Before 2018.
You can look at Trump running in West Virginia with a login to You Tube and now look at what is happening.
Trump may have led the church to the decision of a high court, the Brett Kavanaugh, on sexual charges and the probation officer of the Senate vote as the FBI is still investigating.
However, it is the intent of the storm of the campaign to help the Republicans gain the incentive to cope with the Moon's choices.

The Rudder 2018 American team is confident of fighting and keeping the prospects for one - day sports a Sunday.
After a three - side convention, on Saturday afternoon, the Ruder Cup games may have been four times as likely.
A full - fledged weapon is a game program that has been started but the players believe in it, not in comparison.
Where, then, will they say that they are stronger now?
"They are leading six points and are now four, so we continue as if by less force I'm thinking" says Jordan Spieth as they drive a little by day.
Europe has the chance of, indeed, four points ahead of the twenty.
Americans, as Spieth puts it, have little joy and much to be encouraged, not by the way of the Spieth and by Justin Thomas to play all day and to get three points.
Spieth has been dangerous and has been taking the lead by example.
Those in attendance were very happy when he was, patient golf is essential for the balance between Thomas and himself.
His golf course won the game by the same 15th pleasure, and this type tells you that you believe that the American group has not yet come out.
"Truly you will have to dig deeper and worry about your game," says Spirit.
One of these players is now left.
18 shafts to mark them.
The only player with more grades than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are these Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, asked in the dyder Cup.
Europe's odd but a match that makes it very kind and determined.
The "Moliwood" is the only fathers who will not start the begey on Saturday afternoon, but avoid bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
This race, in both cases, comes from this noisy crowd who conclude that they are the winners on Sunday, and there will no longer be famous athletes who will be eager to win Europe as the sun kills This Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
The two mines are not exactly alike
The well - known talk in Europe has not changed, yet it has not.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, the upper bloodbulls in the morning, when Alex Noren was arrested.
Bogey and the front doubles leave a long gap in Spain and Swede will not reach them.
On Sundays, no one will help you get out of your mine.
Fourbals and ourursomes enjoy watching closely because of cooperation between fathers, counsel given, firm counsel, and quick - witted tactics.
Europe has been well established as a team and led to the end but the dustsomes have shown that the USA still has the power to continue, by choice, in the United States.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the last day, the Ruder Cup.
Europe will be on the best on the last day of the Ruder Cup after going out the fourbals and folders on Saturday on 10-6 leading in the United States.
duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Moninari won twice as hard as attracting Tiger Woods with four points from the Golf National.
On the European side Thomas Bjorn, is willing to dip the cup that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the failure of America on the second follalls, and a 31 series.
The U.S. has set up a difficult and lost fo'c'sle, to win two games, but it will not just make a match.
Jim Furryk, on the other hand, needs nine points on the 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to find out for himself in the order of the same Molinari, he called her "Molliwood" after a good weekend not being the fourth of their four lessons in the Rud Cup history.
In contrast with Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourbals, they then took on the Bryson Dechhambeau in 5&4.
Woods, has entered the two Saturday games, expressed great determination, but now she has lost 19 of 29 fields and a row of folders.
Justin Rose, sitting in the morning fourbals, returned to a ta Henrik Stenson on the fo'c's in 2.1 to divide Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – third classes around the world.
And they are determined to return to power in any way they can get it, only to look at the cruelty, the uncleanness.
The Jordan Spieth and Justini are three times more likely to defeat the Americans by three points on Saturday.
They gained 2 &1 by breaking the Jon Rahm and the Spanish Ian Powerter in foullls and later the Poulter and Rory McIlroy at 4&3 in the fo'ves while crossing two open holes.
In the case of Ruder Cup only two times a team from four points to single games, on the other hand, trying only to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, the Sunday attack seems to be overcoming them.
North Korea says that it ‘ will not be armed on the outside it doesn't trust it.
A North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that it continues to magnify disloyalty in the United States and that it is impossible for the world to release nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body of the General Assembly that North Korea made up the "rearing" last year, such as nuclear deterrence and nuclear testing, nuclear disarmament, and promising to prevent further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "Noma, we don't see an answer from the U.S."
"Unbelieved in the U.S. would have no hope for security in the world, but under this situation there is no way to be self-constituted.
While it is not consistent with North Korea's study of North Korea's rejection of the Washington's "crime" nuclear conclusions while North Korea may be rewarded for taking steps, the statement is that it does not prevent total nuclear extinction as Pyongang did previously.
Ri refers to a statement established by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump first met between the president U.S. and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work on the "renucation of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised the protection of North Korea.
North Korea has been trying to bring an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States ordered Pyongang to release nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists on the "First ending" and raises the pressures of the law to carry out its aim by force, and also reject the "war's proclamation" says R.
"Knowing that the law can humble us what is the dream of people who don't care about us.
The problem, though, is that going on does raise our self - confidence.
Ri has not disclosed plans for reunification between Kim and Trump that U.S. leader has revealed it to the United Nations from the United Nations.
The minister presented at least three seminars between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If half of the case of nuclear extinction was in South Korea and not in the U.S., the nuclear removal of Korean penicillin will not cause this commitment."
Even so, Ri's voice was quite different from that of the previous year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that looks at the U.S. front and the North Korea's rockets that took place behind "Mu. As the evil Judge Trump called Kim "rocketman" for this.
This year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened the "exasperation of North Korea, raised Kim with her courage of not to take up armed action, but there is much more to be done and the law remains until North Korea eliminates the nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump says he has no time for all this, saying "If it takes two, three, or five years."
China and Russia argued as the U.N. Security Council to win the Pyongang with action taken.
Even so, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: Security Council on Thursday: "The forced order of the Security Council must continue with force and will not fail until we see the conclusion, full, and evidence of the nuclear extinction."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in violation of the law since 2006 in stopping nuclear payments and Pyonging system.
Pompeii met Ri with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we have visited again Pyongang the next month to prepare for a second time.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final trip has not been smooth.
He left Pyongyang in July when the progress was made, of North Korea alone by making a public display of the "just as a criminal."
North Korea arranges a meeting with Moon this month to complete the radioactive area and nuclear combination when the United States takes the "one action."
He said that Kim told me of the ‘ similar steps" she wanted to strengthen safety when Trump promised to be in Singapore and created a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard heady students help them get enough sleep
During this year the new Cornor University of Harvard University all lay heavily in order to overcome the habit of taking caffeine ‘ all night long.'
The educational program has found many students in high - school schools that have little to lose when it comes to basics that they can take care of the dog.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert in Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course, the first of this type of U.S.
She was encouraged to start a course after giving a talk on how sleep takes me to read.
At the end of her came a girl to me, saying, 'Why did this be told me now, in my middle age?'
He said that no one had told him of my strange – sleeping sleep, and told Telegram.
Corurse was first released this year, explaining to students the importance of sleep habits that help the park and exercise, while promoting the daily well - being of its readers.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and former director of the university's educational system, said the university has decided to die during the week that many students do not sleep at all.
The length of the study includes a series of steps being taken.
The first part is the picture of the school room, where students choose the coraffe, caffe, the caffe, the trainers, and the books on the effects of caffeine and the light of exercise help in sleep, and how sleep.
On the other hand, participants are told that avoiding longer sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, stroke, and cancer.
A compass map, with useful signs, will then encourage those who share in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
'We know that he will not change the behaviour of the disciples' immediately.
We believe they have a right to know — just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke, ’ adds Professor Czeisler.
The custom of boasting in the ‘ community until ’ is a practice, saying, which adds that modern technology and excessive pressure to students reduces sleep levels which are a growing problem.
To ensure sufficient, sufficient sleep, it must be the student's ‘ secret weapon ’ to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means to avoid obesity, since lack of sleep puts the mind in the form of hunger, making them hungry.
Raymond Shuti, a 19 - year - old student in California who is a student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design a study, having studied at one of his classes a year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the study opened his eyes and urged him to study the study and attend the entire seminar.
The next step, along with hope, is to ask the high - class students to learn the same way before they join the school that can compete well.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider catching the alarm when they are going to sleep, however, that they will wake up, and understand the evil effect of ‘ blue light produced by the electric screens and LED light, which can cause them to escape from orbit, leading to the angle of the angle.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranges: Menga article lowers Gerard’s men
Ringers were organized and left when arrested by Dolly Menga who attacked Steven Gerard's unhurt and dropped it to the ground and failed 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox has even intended to record their first victory since they won February 41 on St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team responsible for the second defeat of Gerard on 18 games as the vice president who left his side of the Ladrokes Premiershipsts.
Menga attacked you for seven minutes before the haf-time and the Ringers' players persevered without any resistance to the fighting.
While Ringers now descended to the sixth, Livingstone climbs to the third quarter and behind Hebernian apart.
And there may be a problem to come in Ringers after a line of Calum Spence was excavated with the first aid after an accident caused by something thrown away.
Gerard has made eight changes in the Ayr's past to the Betfried Cup of Funals.
Holt, on the other hand, took the same Book 11 out of Hearts the previous week and could rejoice in the way your well - worn clothes kept the opponents from the air in all directions.
Ringers may have held the ball in high esteem, but Livingstone has done much with his gained ball.
They would have failed within two minutes when Menga’s sleeping sent Scott Pittman to the article of Allan McGregor but the umpire lost a lot of opportunity to cross a ball.
Kehingen Jacobs's Free kick obtained Craig Halkettoi-sipper but his partner Alan Lithglow has dug it far from behind.
Ringers managed to control but was more trusting than to believe in their game in the last third category of the game.
Alfred Morelos felt that he should have obtained a pencil from us while he was wrestling with Steve Lawles but with a secretary named Steven Thomson had dismissed the Colombian request.
Ringers can insert two points with the first half facing the pole but an older Ibrox sticker Liam Kelly is not concerned about Lasssana Coububaly's headhead and the reduced attack of Ovie Ejaria.
When Lisa opened the opening in the 34th minute there may have been no sport, no one would deny that they were fit for their work.
The Ringers again failed to resist the pull of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher taunted Scott Robinson, who had us coolly sent Menga to finish it easily.
Gerardube and movements after a break during changing Coubally on Ryan Kent, and this change almost accelerated when the champion jumped to Morelos but Kelly, who is impressed, runs from his line to block.
But Livingstone goes on to describe the spectators by playing their game, and Lithgow and Halket tosing ball in the long backs.
The Holt's side could open the gap to lead in the final stages, but McGregor stopped Jacobbs before Lithgow hit the corner.
General Ringers Glenn Middleton finds the tract long ago while fighting with Jacobs but Thomas is also looking aside.
Almanac: Geiger Counter receivable
And now our page of the " Sunday Morning" Almanac: Hope 30, 1882, and UBAA... the day when the next physics was born in Germany by Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger has developed a method of identifying and measuring the radioactivity, which led to the development of the commercials that eventually came to be built for the Geiger Counter.
The nucleus of science since then, the Geiger Counterer that became the core of the popstone, such as in the 1950 “Bells of Coronado, ” to which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Husband: "What is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, is used to obtain radar material for minerals, such as uranium.
While you are inserting open cells, you may be able to hear the atoms released by the radioactivity.
Evans: "We, it's going out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before 63 years.
But this original name bears his name forever.
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ identify ’ wrong cells
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ identify ’ wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the immune system to ‘ identify ’ wrong cells as a treatment program
The procedure involves taking the immune system cells from the patient, replaced by the cell
'Not see' normal protein in most cancers and then reactivated
The goal of color is to indicate the promising results to patients with cancerous types.
A woman treated with the goal of learning the immune system to detect the wrong cells had seen the cervix vanishing at the end of 18 months.
This procedure involves taking protective cells from the patient, converted into a laboratory to "see" normal protein in a large number of cancers called heR2, and reactivated cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "protocols the growth of cancers," including breast, uterus, lung and other cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same way to take protective cells from patients is to teach them" how you understand cancer cells that have worked well in treating some form of leukemia.
West once had the idea of establishing Trump, wearing the MAGA helmet, after his appearance with a cup of beer.
It’s not going well
Once West was hailed by a radio to Saturday Light Live after singing praises to the American President Donald Trump and said that he would join the election by 2020.
After singing his third night song, called the Ghost Town when wearing a cap of Mke America Great, he began to sound through Democrats and confirmed the establishing of Trump.
"How often do I talk to white people and then say, "How can you love Trump, you are prejudiced?"
If I had been concerned about prejudice I would have left America long ago, he said.
SNL started the program with Matt Damon's chapter when a Hollywood official ridiculed the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Special Committee on cases of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
In spite of the publicity, the West sound series was put in chat rooms by the poet Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to ridicule West by writing it.
Also, West complained to onlookers that it was hard on her back to the platform that I put it on my head.
"They hit me on the back of the platform.
They said, ‘ Don't have that helmet there.'
They beat me!
They also said that I was in a mine area," says, according to the Branch Committee of Washington.
The West went on and said: "Do you want to see the location of the plots?" saying "Can you wear his superman cap, because it means that you won't tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try love.
Not until long ago they had been seen twice by the viewer and the shy SNL team, while Variety reported, one telling the printers: "The radio was silent."
The West was fitted with the pledge of the singer Ariana Grande over time, his old boyfriend, Rapper Mark Miller has died a few days ago.
The West text is many about the singing of the song I Love item, presized as a Perrier Bottle.
West is named for the head of the former TUPSA, Candace Turner who fitted the twetter, said: "There is a strangely strong air: WE ARE AWNING TO A EXPLORER AND ANGER.."
But the director of a chat program Karen Hunter wrote to the twetter that the West "twetters the person who’s sitting and that's good."
"But I chose not to hire anyone (by buying his music or clothing or establishing his "art"), which I believe is present and full of dangerous ideas in society.
You are free.
So we are," he adds.
Before the exhibition, rapper feared to have changed his name, saying that he will now be called "by the old name Kane West."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follow in the steps of Diddy, also known as the Pushdy, Puffy, and Piddy.
Spper, Snup Dogg’s partner was once called Snop Lion and with him really a red - blooded singer Prince, changed his name with the sign and named Prince.

Kit Hartton knows more about the location of his sword piercing by Jon Snow in the history of the violent series of HBO Game of Threees.

' What did we teach the men when they grew up, according to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that through role models, he can be a little more likely to influence him to develop improper masculinity
You continue: ‘ What nature has been taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, makes young boys confident of the case of masculinity?
I think that’s the big problem at this time - we’re changing that?
For there is an obvious thing that is wrong with young men.
In conversation you have also agreed that you will not make prequels or sequels at the Game of Thorns when the game is going to end at the end of summer, saying you have finished with horses' arenas.
Since November Kit will play on Sam Shepard’s True West, a story of the filmmaker and his brother, who breaks.

China announces a 14% increase in the number of residents living with the plague and increases the number of complaints.
Over 820,000 people were affected, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.

Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to bring about earth’s survival in deadly plagues.
Maxine Waters deny that one job has escaped the knowledge of the GOP neators', explosions of the ‘ dangerous false ’ and also the 'rejectors'.
The U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has published the claim that one of his employees has included the data of three constors in the U.S. legislation page in Wikipedia.
The Democrats of Los Angeles explain that these charges are spread by the superpowers "betra-righting" and the Web sites.

The recorded information includes home and U.S. Sens addresses. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, both in Utah.
The information appears on the Internet on Thursday, installed by a stranger to Capitol Hill while the Senate governor is listened to the sexual denouncing of the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh.
The explosion appears after Kavanaugh was submitted to three manator questions.
Old Web sites such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedSTate reported that the IP address points out that the Waters office is related to it and that it is the source of the data of Waters, reports Hill.
"These uncertainties are false and false," continues Waters.
"The integrity of my employees – the ownership, the individual’s number, and the safety of the victim as a result of false charges of fraud and – did not involve the breaking of the account.
These base charges are absolutely false and not true."
Waters statement soon became critical to the Internet, including the former secretary of the White House Express Ari Fleischer.
"To deny rather than give up," writes Fleischer.
"This means that he has no gentleness to accept the Controgate.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not give up.
They should not give up.
They should not accuse the accused’s motives.
They must be quiet and at peace.
Fleischer, who compares Waters' answer to the criticism of Democrat Justice Kavanaugh, who was criticized by the critics who were too tired at the time of trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a member of the Republic who is going to enter Waters’s shoes in a middle selection of time, put him in his mind at Twitt.
"Great if true," he writes to Titus.
In his statement, Waters told his office to inform the ‘ competent officials and the judiciary of these frauds.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," she continues, "and they will be held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts anywhere or all my employees."
Vision of Johnny English Strikes Again - lowers the Spy poof of Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to consider Brexit's importance in any British film, and it does not look like the promotion of the Johnny English game that began in 2003 with Johnny English and Johnny English and its 2011 restoration of the Johnny English Reborn.
Eating hot potatoes as we said in the article that we may have a new opportunity to sell outside?
At any rate, the open - eyed face of Johnny English’s second - to - the - second promotion - that name is a big joke designed for the non - English - speaking movie theater.
He is indeed a keen observer who outnumbers his unusual illusions to the glittering flashs of Clouauau, Mr Bean's tatter and his strength from the Chariots of Fire Theme in the 2012 Olympics.
It is also from a secret traveler and Atkinson, who passes through the latest commercials into the Barclacard TV, who has left the turmoil at his wake.
There are other times and two of this current visit to J.
I like Johnny English to get on the helicopter with an old military suit and small swords hanging on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift is an admiral, but humor seems to be too low and too appealing, especially in the production of "deep" films such as 007 and the Mission Impossable itself now providing humor as a substance.
The humor is more than children, and to me Johnny English’s journey is neither too smooth nor too smooth and rigid in Atkinson’s silent film with Bean’s sounds and personality.
The story in the back is now that Great Britain is in a large company.
The cyber-Hacker entered the secret task of British explorers, presenting the data of British-jets in the field, which is concerned with a job - a small task to Kevin Eldon.
The last minute of the full-time prime in which you are carrying is hot, facing a failure in the political community: Emma Thompson is trying to imitate Teresa-May but there is no reason for the text to offer.
His spies inform him that all the spies were to be sent back, that they must follow the man who was still in the field.
This means that Johnny English itself, now like a shoolmaster in an expensive, but does provide some explicit lessons about the character of a checker: these jokes, as English offers the obscenities in Rock-type cardemy.
Englishud in Whiteall to be given urgent orders and to be joined by his partner Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, associated with submarine commander, a pleasant place to play by Vicki Pepperine.
Batman and Robin are therefore actively involved in the Queen's Secret Ministry back, meeting Olga Kurylenko's being autil system of Ephelia Bulletin.
Then, the prime minister is fast on the practice of millions who say he can solve computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, which Jake Lacy played.
English and Bough began a strange journey: hidden as a mat, they started a fire in a restaurant in France; they started a problem selling them with the Volta luxury boat; and English that took the misunderstanding while learning to use the Virtual Real Reality headset to adjust the Volt house.
All efforts are made to improve the last chapter or to have a friendship and force, rather than the children’s TV about everything.
He has always stood by them.
And like other films of Johnny English I couldn’t control it: Britain’s film field was not able to give Rowan Atkinson seven good room?
Labour denies that they proposed to work for Britons for four days but to be paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn team of Laborer thinks a strange scheme to see Britons working four victims – but paid for five.
The team reports that they want company managers to pass on the profits made by Articial Intelligence (AI) to the employees by granting them more day.
Work crews seem to have a good three - day weekend — but pay the same amount.
The theory, say the sources, can fit the economic aim of the group as well as the program to convert the nation into the labor force.
The four - day transition is authorized by the Trade Union Congress as a way to take the opportunity to change the economy.
The elderly field Labor Party tells The Sunday Times: ‘ Medical tests are expected to be done before the end of the year.
‘ It won't happen in the night but four days in the church but working four days is a reflection of the economic system of the reindeeration to reap workers and the whole concept of the field.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to recommend the plan, and the Green Party’s commitment to four working days during the 2017 gene operation of its track mark.
The idea had not yet been established by the entire Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A four-day job is not an organization’s cure and is not considered by the group at all.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has used the last Labour church conference to express his view of capitalism in the economy.
Mnz McDonnell said he was willing to set his eyes on and the force was back to ‘ the unknown guides ’ and ‘ the winners ’ of the plant firms.
The modedow channelor also explains that dosholders in water companies may not get the whole party as the Labour government does ‘ pull ’ in the wrong ways.
He also ensures that the crew will be replaced in the company board and in the Inclusive Overship Funds to give 10 percent per cent of purvate-serial films to the personnel, who will be leaked for a year a profit limited to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy observed "60 Minutes" that the FBI research about Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The FBI investigation by judge Brett Kavanaugh reduced the election of the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the findings of the detectives can change the way accelerators in Republiccan influence followers.
In a Sunday discussion, the "60 Minutes" chairman Scott Pelley asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if she could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more relaxed than his South Carolina friends.
"I tell, of course," says Kennedy.
"When I went aside to the side, I also spoke with the Judge Kavanaugh.
I called her after doing this, and those questions went out, and I said, 'Have you done this?'
He is stubborn, he is stubborn and uncomplaining.
Graham’s jaw, though, seems to have been cut.
"My mind is determined by Brett Kavanaugh and will take a firm condemnation," he said.
"Dt. Ford, I know what has happened, but I know this: Brett immediately object," adds Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not all readers are sure of this.
It has been 36 years.
I see nothing changing.
What did the Global Citizen Festival, and Has It Taken a Superwoman to Reduce Poverty?
In this Saturday New York will handle the Global Citizen Festival, a annual event with a list of active players and those with the same intention; to eradicate poverty from the earth.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be with human locusts coming into the huge stadium of Central Park not only to please Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but to sleep with the real intention of eliminate poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project, an international organization that strives to eliminate poverty by increasing its fighting population.
To get a ticket for a party (except that you want to pay for VIP ticket tickets), tourers had to do something to do on something "work" such as volunteering, sending mail to the director of the world, calling or doing something deeper to help you concentrate on getting out of poverty.
How successful has the Global Citizen 12 years remaining to its goal?
Is the idea of profiting people with free will the right way to try people to do something, or is something else called "clictivism" – people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on a computer screen or sending a ticket?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has highlighted the "actions" of their more than 19 million adherents, the treatment of different purposes.
It says that these actions have helped to reduce the world’s global slums to the peace of care and goals that come over $37 billion that will affect 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By 2018, a group has collected 390 suggestions and notices since their actions, about $10 million spent or tried to collect.
A team estimates that the income has a direct influence on some 649 million people worldwide.
Other commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.S. co-consumers and founders of the "Helping Children Properly," promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eradicate hunger in the world after getting the 4,700 eels in the Global Cities.
"By the establishment of the UK government, donors, national governments, and the Global Citizens like you, we can try to make a history of malnutrition because of a lack of public improvement," the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman led the crowd to a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that there have been more than 5,000 years to call the U.K. for better nutrition for mothers and children, the government has declared the project's support, the Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children in adequate nutrition.
In reply to some of their FAQs on their website asking "What do you think we can do to eliminate severe poverty?"
The Global citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as public rights and anti-partheid protests before us, we will win, because we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekkd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, some of the others who contributed to this New York event, which was celebrated by Deborra-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The US may well use the ‘ blocking ’ to prevent the transfer of Russia’s Interetary Energy - Interetary Entigator
Washington "if necessary" can use ships to prevent Russian 5, including the Middle East, the Internal Secretry Ryan All revealed it, by the Washington Examiner.
All of them have said that Russian and Syria discussions, when working with the government's official signatures – is a method of testing other new nergy markets.
"I believe in the reason why the Middle East wants to find an intergy as in Eastern Europe, and in the middle of its European history, reports.
And, in harmony with the employee, there are ways to repair it.
"The United States is able, by means of our army, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, shut down, to ensure that their powers do not go to market," he says.
Zince has been talking to the participants at a conference sponsored by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself a "power-power voice" in the US.
He also compared the Washington efforts to cope with Russia and Iran, saying that the results are the same.
" Choosing to trade with Iran and Russia, to some extent, is a means of obtaining and obtaining oil," he said, when he spoke of Russia saying that it is a ‘ steed horse" and has a economy dependent on oil tankers.
These statements appear as the Trump office strives to promote the export of their natural gas into Europe, replacing Russia, a more expensive method for European consumers.
As a result, officials of Trump’s office, including the US president Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to emerge from the Nord Stream 2 project of the Northern Stream "unm", according to Trump, which has made Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 - $11 billion tubes, which are designed to double the present total volume of the water pipes to a depth of up to 60 feet [1010 m], are really an economic project.
The Kremlin issue against the Washington project consistently is due to economic reasons and is an example of the unjust competition.
"I believe we have the same idea that power can not be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose whom to buy," says Russian Powerful Minister Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with the US Rick Perry Secretary in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused Germany to withdraw, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
A leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to resign from the EU’s mighty scheme and accords between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third world interferes with our supplying power," says Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent conference between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

18 states, D.C. supports the work of a new safety project
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support a new legal effort to have a new U.S. goal that prohibits protection from people fleeing from criminal or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and district sent a statement to witnesses on Friday in Washington to support a person needing protection against this goal, reports NBC News.
The full name of the attorney at Grace v. Assos which the American Civil Liberty Union has inserted in August against the state's goal has not yet been revealed.
She said that her partners and her sons were violent gang members," tormented her, but U.S. officials would not accept her request for protection on July 20.
She has been settled in Texas.
State advocates of Grace defined El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of people with U.S. welfare applications, as countries facing major problems with crime and domestic violence.
The U.S. new U.S. policy of protection turns the 2014 Board of Imigrant Appeals that allowed non-slipers to escape domestic violence to find protection.
The Aturney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in its statement on Friday a new goal is "not to pay attention to the law of the state, and of the world."
"The law says that all appeals for protection must be judged on the facts of each case and of the application, and making a decision like this is a violation of that law," says the witness called by the court.
The lawyers also pointed out that the goal that prevents settlers from entering the U.S. economy is destroying the U.S. economy, claiming that they may be businessmen and ‘ create jobs.
The Attrney General Jeff Sesions advised arrive judges to no longer to protect people from domestic violence and criminal violence in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or terror because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a certain group or political opinion," says Sesions in his declaration on June 11.
Protection was not intended to eliminate all problems -- and even all the major problems that people are facing every day around the world.
Much effort is made in Palun as the number of deaths is repeated in efforts to locate survivors
For the survivors, the condition is deep.
"It's really serious," says 35-year-old Rsa Kusa Kusuma, comforting her son at the center of those who have survived in the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings dead bodies.
We have no clean water.
The villagers seem to be returning to their ruined homes, looking for their goods in abundance, trying to find anything they could find.
Hundreds of people are also injured in hospitals, damaged by an quake of 7.5 magnitude, were filled with death.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, were sitting outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of an ongoing quake.
Tears well up in his eyes as he recalls the scene in the fifth - floor hotel where his wife and daughter were living.

I had been depressed on the broken walls, I think," she told the Associated Press, adding that her family was still in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and it was quiet.
I don't know what has happened to her and to my child.
I hope they are alive.
A U.S. ambassador accuses China 'on false advertising'.
A week later the official Chinese newspaper has a four - page U.S. commercial advertising of both U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing by using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday told of the goods paid for China Daily at Des Moines Register - Iowa newspaper after racking China for the issue of a choice in Nov. 6 in the U.S.
The Trump charge that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election created what U.S. officials said to Routers was a new class in Washington’s campaign of oppression in China.
While foreign governments are usually involved in commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are now caught in a war of increasing trade that creates a steady flow of income when sending goods to each other.
The funds required by China at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to rob the exports to places like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, say researchers from China and the U.S.
Terry Branchad, a U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who sent most of the agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged the American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Branstad on the Sunday issue Des Moines Register, "We are twice as likely to torture by making false ads in our free newspaper."
"In the province that has been distributed, the Chinese government has made it available in the American popular culture of free speech and newspaper by posting a freed advertisement to Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the contrary, at the street market here in Beijing, there are few different views you will find and you will not see the true reaction of the varied views that the Chinese may have about the consequences of the Chinese economic problem, if it is thought that the media are viewing the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He has added that "one of China's leading newspapers has escaped the opportunity to print" his story, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans Kill Battered Women Before the Medieval Choice because of Kavanaugh’s Failure, Warning Exactors
Since most Republicans are waiting for and protecting the possibility of being brought to the High Court by Brett Kavanaugh to several charges of abuse, the analysts have warned that the wood will return with the mugger, especially for the mother, during the middle court term.
High lungs in this regard, and many Republicans are already expressing their desire to move ahead with the choice.
Those things will no longer be overlooked," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill in a Saturday article.
Reeher has doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last efforts to make an investigation will suffice to make angry votes down the lungs.
" Women will never forget what happened yesterday - will not be forgotten in November and November," says Karen Jean-Pierre, a red - hot counselor and international spokesman for the growing Moveon group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted, “Come November! ” as they rioted in the Senate auditorium as the Republicans controlled the Juciary Committee, choosing to continue and select Kavanaugh despite the evidence delivered by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Deocrats and incentives will end," says Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, telling the media.
"People say it’s already hot; it's true.
But it may still be much higher, especially among the voters of women in the cities and young voters, aged 18-9, that although they don't like the president, they rarely vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony with details of his charges against the risk of being brought to the Supreme Court, the analysts say that the wood could return with the accolades if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has been the damage to God," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the previous week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or a final vote or that Kavanaugh is put on the platform, about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they dealt with him," says Guy Cecil, director of the Proritics USA, a group helping people to choose Democrats, telling the media.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on what to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and are inclined to break up Kavanaugh.
New figures from You Gov show that 41 percent of the people certainly or to some extent believe the Ford evidence, while 35 percent claim to be true or to some extent Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38 percent thought that Kavanaugh was definitely or to some extent lying on the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressed by Fllake, the FBI now examines the charges brought by Ford and at least one defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford declared before the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had abused her alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the defendant in the High Court presented his private parts to him while they were in the party during your study period at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Editor Editing New Network Conflicting Network
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, starts a program that will conflict with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
A new technology project, the Inrupt, is a company built at the open source of the Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their database will be kept and the information people are allowed to reach.
In a unique conversation with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the goal of Inrupt is "to conquer the world."
"We must do it now," so does this task.
"It's history."
This applet uses Solid technology to allow people to create a " doscal online data" or POD.
It can also include lists of people, to whom you should do the same, a calendar, a music library, and other tools that are available to you.
It is like a Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify all are found in one brush and at the same time.
What is significant about the POD store is that it depends on a user to find out which type of data is available.
The company calls it "a net which gives you power."
The concept of Inrupt, in accordance with the CEO of the company, is for the company to bring in parsus, physoms, and skills necessary to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Brucece, a security platform purchased by IBM, volunteer workers with contract applications, and many volunteer licenses.
From this report, international technology designers may begin their applications using the tools available to the Inruptle.
Berners-Lee has said that she and her group speak with "Fafuok and Google as to whether it should or should be brought about a complete change in which their entire business will change completely.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In another column in the Media printed Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "will provide the power of trade and operating system which will help to protect integrity and a new moth building built on Solid.."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Webconsortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has taken the lead in the debate on neutrality.
Even when an innup is published, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide WebConsortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm looking forward to the start of this future web age," adds Berners- Leee.
Bernard Vann: Commended by a pastor who has received a Victoria Cross for WW1
The only minister of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during World War I has been praised in his city after 100 years.
Lt Col Cardinal Bernard Vann won a prize in September 29, 1918 on the attack in Belledise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not realize that he had won the largest prize in the British army.
A memorial is opened with his two grandchildren at a time in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, has been a ‘ good sign ’ for a stone to be opened in a hundred years right since his grandfather won the prize.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his force across the Canal de Saint-Qentin's "on a heap of artillery and guns."
Later she rushed to the shooting area and led ahead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, who is 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions are ‘ something I don't know I wouldn't be able to do but something to respect him."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put flowers after the turn, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "the nation has the great right to participate in the clock" and said that "the real priority may be shown by the support which many people will give."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they received Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch Ballator 206 and be forbidden to watch a party.
The San Jose ceremony consisted of 13 games, including six on the principal card and was shown all night on UK at Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Mousussi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, the UK viewers were left surprised when the station changed to Pepa Pig.
Some had been unwilling to wait all night until sunrise, especially waiting for the contest.
One Twutterer defined this transition to children's animation as "unexpected laughter."
"It's a government order that by 6 a.m. the contest was inappropriate and that it had to be changed to the order of the children," says Dave Schwartz, president of the Bellator of the trade and communications, when asked about this change.
"A "Apopig the pig," yes."
The president of the Bellator company Scott Coker said they would take a close look at their cheeses in order to include the UK spectators in the future.
"I think that if I think about playing it again, I think we might try to play it," says Cooker.
‘ But it is the sixth hour on Sunday there and we can’t fix the matter until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But we do.
I tell you, during the change, there is a lot of e - mail and all of it is bad.
Trying to fix it, we thought it was a technological problem.
But not, it has been a matter of government.
I promise never again.
We will keep up - to - date with no more than six contests — just as we are used to do and try to please our followers and have gone to extremes.
It was an undesirable situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt ‘ outcasted ’ because of his sex
Olympic athlete Tom Dayley says that he has grown up isolated because of his sex - but that gives him the incentive to succeed.
The 24-year-old player said that he didn't realize it until he went to high school to say "Not everyone loves me."
Speaking of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs first published by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about the rights of homosexuals in order to give others the "hope."
He also said that if a parent made him not to be concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular broadcast for the current session, Kirsten Young, has completed months of inactivity because of her illness.
Coming up as a person rejected in Laverne's first program, Daley said that she felt that it was "relented" by everyone as she grew up because it was“ not acceptable for boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, a feeling of being different, have been a real feeling that has given me strength and strength to cope."
She wanted to prove that she too was a ‘ man, ’ he said, so that she would not let everyone be discouraged when it was finally revealed to be a homosexual.
This winner, who twice received the Olympic prize, became a member of the top LGAT project and used his position at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to persuade other countries not to view homosexuality as a crime against homosexuality.
He said that he has spoken because he feels privileged to be able to live a simple life without problems and wants to give the ‘ hope ’ to others.
This warrior who won three international championships said that he was dating the US movie producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "Before's arrival."
Daley married and was given the Oscar prize, which he left for the past 20 years, but the age difference has never been a problem.
"The more you experience in life at such a young age" - Go to her first Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - says it is hard to find someone of his age who has had similar experiences.
The two adopted a child through June, a son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said, "his opinion" has changed.
"If you would ask me a year ago, it's related to the 'I want to win a gold ring'," he said.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My gold bracelet of the Olympic gold is Robbie.
Her son has the same name as that of his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
She said that her father did not accept her dying and that one of the last things she had asked if they had tickets to London 2012 - as she wanted to be.
"I couldn't say you could not be present in those games'," he said.
"I took her by hand when she had last breath and until she had her last breath and died there I realized that she was a person like us," she said.
The following year Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and received a bronze medal.
"I suddenly realized that this was what I had been looking for all my life — swimming in front of my people in the Olympic Games, he said," he said.
It also gave him the choice of his favorite song - Heather Small — which has been a recurring psychological event during the preparation of the Olympics and still exerts pressure on him.

Mickelson has been seated on a bed on the readder Cup on Saturday
Philip Mickelson of America will make a record of Sunday when he plays his 47rd Cup game, but he will have to raise the circus to avoid embarrassing history.
Mickelson, who will be playing on the same event in two 12 years, is seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furryk on the faceballs and on Saturday.
Rather than being the leader, as he often takes the lead in the United States, this fourth winner splits out a second day and worked on his game in hopes of finding out what is contributing to his downfall.
Since he is not a good soccer player even when he has time to play the game, this 48 - year - old player is not fit for the Le Golf National game, where the main game is often a problem when you play long - distance ball.
And if the place for the game is not so a problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the nineth game a week, will meet the British Open player Francesco and know how to hit right, who was playing with the red Tommy Fleetwood to win four of their games in the week.
If these Americans, who lose four points in 12 games, start the game well, Mickelson's game can be a last resort.
Furryk has expressed hope for his friends, and nothing else has been said.
"You fully understand what role he has today, and you put on my back with my arm and said he would be ready for tomorrow," said Furryk.
"You are very confident of yourself.
You are a popular actor, having accomplished much in the past and in this report.
I hardly thought of him playing two games.
I had hoped for more, but that is what happened and that is what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone."
Mickelson will rewrite the history of Nick Faldo on the number of games he has played with the Great Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game on the Ruder Cup that has never been compared to what you’ve achieved as a player.
Mickelson has won 18 times, was eaten 20 times and played an equal number, although Furryk says that his presence has improved the group.
"It's good to be with her, she likes to laugh, like making fun of people, and you’re a good person in a gang room," she explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed being with him, and, in this report, it would be good to see you.
He does much more than play.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that taking the lead in many points is meaningless
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that taking the lead in many points when moving on the last day of the waves to the Ruder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
Dane played for the first time in 1997 in Valderrama, when the captain group of Sever Ballestero took five points over the Americans but was finally at the top of one point, winning at 141.
"You always remind yourself that we were leading in many points in Valderrama; we led many points in Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderrama, where we won, but in a few points," says Bjorn, who is in the picture, after viewing the 2018 Kilasi at 5-3 both Friday and May 6 in order to lead in Le Golf National.
So the history will show me and everyone in the group that it has not been finished.
Do your best next day.
Go there and do everything in the right way.
It is not until you have reached the conclusions that you have reached.
We have a goal in mind, and we are keeping this in mind.
I’ve said this before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know that there's more than one of the world's largest sports team."
Thrilled with the way his players play in a difficult place, Bjorn has added: "I’ll never have to reach this conclusion.
The next game is different.
The next day, each player will decide how to play the game will be, and this is a different matter.
It is good to go out and play with someone when things are going well, but if you play alone, there is where you are fully tested as a golf players.
That is the message you have to pass to the players, that you do all you can to do tomorrow.
Now, he leaves his partner behind and has to go and do all he can."
In contrast with Bjorn, his rival Jim Furryk will be seeing his players perform better apart than what has happened, except the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, three of the four points.
Furryk himself knows both eating and winning on the last day at the last minute, since he once became a part of a winning team in Brookline before his meal when Europe ‘ swallowed up surprises in Medinah."
"I remember very well," he says in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the Soviet captain, urged his players when the last day will be played.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it would be good to start with a top gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
The more the pressure and enthusiasm you get, the greater the pressure you put on in the middle.
We organized our players in accordance with that and set our players in a way we thought would enable us to practice magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead the fight and return from the games and face Rory McIlroy in the best sport, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Powerter and others of Europe in the upper section.
"I went with the group standing this way because I thought it would be ready for the entire game," said Bjorn for the selected players.
A German warship again narrowed down the finish line
A new version of the German tradition Navy called Frigate was to begin operating in 2014 to replace the old Col War-rara ships, but it will not exist until at least next year because of the system's system and the cost of stowball, reports the local news.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz," head of the new ship Baden-Wuerttemberg-scrigate, now reduced to the first part of 2019, says the Die Zeit newspaper quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the ceremony concerned the future of a determined project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, which had been isolated by Navy as early as 2007, will take the place of the Bremen-Class.
Understandably, ships will have strong guns, various types of explosives, and hidden technology, such as the absence of space, infrared and sound.
Other important installations include long periods of care - not being able to use new ships for two years at a port.
However, a continuing slip means that the important development of the warships - will give Germany power - it will be out of the way when it starts working, says Die Zeit.
The F125 dead ship appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohmbnase Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Navy had sent back the ship where it was built after being brought in.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship's restoration, but the German press has said that there is much more to be concerned about the "soft and Hardwar" which makes the warship useless when sent into the army.
Software problems were especially important since Baden-Wuerttemberg-class would be used by a crew of 120 — a part of the older Bremen ship crew.
It also arose that the ship is over the essential weight that reduces her performance and reduces her chances that Navy will be able to insert things that will improve it in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have double the size of the same ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from Hardwar’s problems, all this project - including for training a team of sailors has become a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
New ships' problems are especially important as there have been recent warnings that the German Naval power was declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Per Bartels, a German official of a parliament committee, confessed to Navy that it correctly "cares the exit and entry of ships which can be used."
The officer said that problems have lasted a hundred years, since old ships were no longer working but no ships in place.
You are disappointed that no Baden-Werttemberg-class ships have been able to join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the hidden life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands area intended to reveal how bats use the environment for food hunting.
It is hoped that the discoveries will give us a better understanding of the life patterns of these rare flying creatures and help to direct future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow popular singing pasters and Daubenton bats with long black ears in Invete Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in specific areas to check the activity of bats throughout this season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will do small research using hand - held checkers.
A rational analysis of all records will show the frequency of bats ’ cries and what certain animals do.
The map of the area and the report will be published for a detailed picture of the area’s lifestyle.
Rob Dewar, NTS game counselor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of importance in bats and how these animals use them.
This information will help to see the benefits of environmental management such as meadow Creation and the best way to preserve areas with bats and other related animals.
Scotland and all the UK bats have been rare throughout the past century.
They are threatened with construction and development that affect the environment and the loss of it.
Electric and electrical outlets can create danger, and so can flies and pesticides, as well as attack by domestic cats.
The bats are not necessarily blind.
However, as they hunt at night, their ears are more active than their eyes when they hunt an animal.
They use a sophisticated sensory system to locate animals and flying creatures.
The NTS, which handles more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 66,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the country, consider bats to be important.
He has ten trained professionals, who make regular checks, check the environment, and how to protect them.
The organization has even organized the first Scots reserve of the Treave bats in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scotland bats live.
David Thompson of the area says that this is an ideal place to live in.
"Here in Threave is a very good place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and other good places.
But there is much about bats we can do, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more what he needs in order to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before working in a building because it may be possible to destroy their own habitat of about 400 or younger bats, virtually all that live in the area.
bats are protected and forbidden by law to kill, torture, or disturb their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish chief of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to come to help.
He said, "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species do not yet know what makes them live."
Ronaldo refuses charges of harassment as lawyers plan to pay a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of the charges that he had made against him as "false stories," saying that people want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers arranged to fine up the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has published these charges.
This Portuguese performer and Juventus is accused of sexual abuse by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2002.
He reportedly paid $375,000 for the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on the video Instagram Live with 142 million of his followers after the interviews were reported, Ronaldo, aged 33, finished these reports by saying "It's a false story."
"No, no, no , no.
What they say today is false news," says a hero who has been crowned with Ballon d'or five times on the camera.
"They tried to make a name for themselves by using a name.
It is normal.
They wanted to be popular by calling my name, but it was part of the work.
I am happy and everything is going well for me," adds the player, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are ready to compensate for the Der Spiegel for these charges, calling them "an unconventional report of claims affecting personal life," says Reuters.
The judge Christian Schchertz said that the player will want to be restored for the "rearing of his dignity on the average number of charges against him, which is probably the most serious concern of the recent human rights loss."
This reported case is reported to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino Las Vegas room.
After meeting at the nightcub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room, where he is said to have been raped, in accordance with the papers installed by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told him that he was a "man ready" "99%" mistaken for "one%" error.
The authorities say that Ronaldo agreed to have sex relations between them, but they had agreed to do so.
Maorga also admitted to the police and took photographs of those who had been injured in the hospital, but later she admitted that the matter was covered outside the court because she feels ‘ afraid to retaliate" and worried about ‘ public shame.'
The 34-year-old woman says that she now wants to change the agreement as she continues to be hurt by what has been said.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from the Manchester United at the time of the survey, and this year he changed to the large Italian group Juve to Ş100 million agreement.
Brexit: UK'll always regret the loss of car manufacturers
UK "will always be sorry" if she will lose her position as world leader in establishing cars after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He has also added that Toyota UK has told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a contract it will temporarily stop production in its plant at Burkaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer has said that the result of slowing down when it comes to failure with Brexit can result in job loss.
Burkaston - The Auris and Avenes of Toyota produced about 150,000 cars last year and 90% were shipped to other countries in the European Union.
"I think that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March the product will stand in our industry," says Marvin Cooke, administrator of the Toyota in Burkaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have threatened to leave the EU without a contract on how foreign trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Today industry at Oxford after a month of Brexit.
The principal concern is related to what car designers call danger if the Brexit agreements are not met.
The production of Toyota is carried out in "the need of the time", parts of cars arrive every 37 minutes from the surgeons both in the UK and in the EU by audio vehicles.
If UK leaves the EU without a contract in 29 March, there may be disturbances at the limits of which the industry claims to lead to drinking and the end of parts of car construction.
It is impossible for Toyota to catch more cars a day in their business in Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may have to be stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Chequers' Chequers of Theresa May for future working with EU "is carefully adjusted to avoid that test at the border."
"We need to get a contract. We want to get a better agreement that will allow us to allow us just as we will not only win now but also take advantage of this opportunity," informing the BBC Radio program.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other industrys is that we need absolutely to be able to carry on what is now successful surgery."
The Toyota could not say how long the product will be established, but in time, it warns that increased expenses will reduce industry efficiency and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvillaris, who has worked in Burkaston for 24 years and is a link to the United States project, says his members are worried: "In what I have seen when these jobs are gone again.
A government spokesman says: "We have established a clear and reliable plan of our future relationship with the EU."
The community of Trump and Rosenstein may be late again, says the White House
The open - air meeting of Donald Trump and general representative Rod Rosenstein may be "resetd with another check" as the war of high court and the establishment of Brett Kavanaugh continues, says White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises a special media activity by Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's disorder of choice, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible troubles of justice from the president.
Whether Trump will expel a general representative, thereby endangering Mueller's freedom, it has provided Washington news that could not be discussed for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein has discussed the pipe in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president's being expelled in the 25th tie.
Rosenstein declined the report.
But last Monday she went to the White House, although there are reports that she was about to quit.
Instead, meeting Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, is announced to be Thursday.
Trump said that it is "unthinkable" not to attack Rosenstein but that the meeting is too late to be avoided against the trial of the Senate judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of bullying, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both have been witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one - week investigation of FBI charges against Kavanaugh, further lowering the full Senate law.
The author of Trump news, Sarah Sanders, has come from Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosesstein, he said: "The date of the event, it may be on this account, I think that it will be replaced by the other check as there are other things that continue with the high court.
But we will see and want to keep the media aware of what is happening.
Some news reporters may disagree with this: Sanders have never had a White House conference since September 10.
The system administrator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of these assemblies is not because the media "they like to talk," although he said, "I will not deny the fact that they speak."
He then points out that there will be a number of connections between Trump and the media.
"The president made more screens of questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, adding without any proof: "We regarded those numbers."
There will still be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media are able to ask direct questions, that's better than talking to me.
We try to do that many times and have seen us do much more in the last few weeks and will replace the media meeting if you are able to speak with the president of the United States."
Trump usually listens to questions when coming out of the White House or when sharing in public chat rooms or public chat rooms and visitors.
He rarely picks up questions in private.
New York in this report probably showed why, uninterested and sometimes carelessly speaking in front of the media.
Health Secretary of Health Writing to EU employees in NHS in Scotland regarding the fear of Brexit
The secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to show appreciation and worldly wishes to stay in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MCS sent a letter 6 months before the UK had dropped from the EU.
The Scotland Government is already committed to pay the required expense of EU citizens ’ requests that work in behalf of the public.
In his book, Msz Freeman wrote: "In summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have moved on, looking to the decisions expected in this age.
But the UK Government has also been preparing its plans to be broken.
I know that this may not be a pleasant time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work that all members of the staff, no matter where they live.
Our colleagues from the EU, and elsewhere, bring in a precious million and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, to the benefit of the patients and the communities in which they work.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."

Rod Reed has told the media that injury takes place just before the vacation.
"You came by the platform and fell to the ground," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical personnel gave Abercrombie health on the bench before putting him in strechecher’s back to examine him.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harrison adds that there is “no details about the type/size of the injury at the present time ” and Tennessee State tries to determine when the injury occurred.

Buyers from other countries will be paid more than their share when buying a UK house
Buyers from other countries will be paid more than their share when they buy a UK house so that this money can be used to help the homeless under the new Tory’s programs
This will make Corbyn’s success in finding young people to vote
For those who do not pay the UK tax, the increase of the system will be required.
Financial members expect to earn about £20 million a year to help the homeless
Buyers from other countries will be paid for a high - quality window if they buy a UK - this house that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be considered an effort to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in trying to attract young people to vote for more cheap housing and to be viewed by people who are paid a lot of money.
The raising of the room will apply to people and businesses that do not pay the UK tax, and this additional amount will contribute to the government's efforts to eliminate homeless people.
This amount - add to the current quality of the room, including the high readings placed two years ago in second houses and sold in about 3 percent.
Financialists expect this to give them about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's rebuilt homes are purchased by non-UK citizens, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to manage housing.
The majority of the wealthy in this area — especially the capital — have become ‘ towns cry empty ’ because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend most of their time away from the country.
A new goal came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of reducing room fees to help more youths find the first homes.
You are concerned with the construction business by keeping up the building costs by taking up the building site and not using it, and urging Nkkz May to close the quotas to the purchase houses in order to fix the ‘ disgrace of houses ’ of Britain.
Mr Coryn has published a detailed series of proposed changes in homes, including the management of rent and the removal of the house "incomparably".
He also wants to give the hinters greater strength to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: ‘ Last year I said I’m going to be devoted to restoring Britain’s dream — that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing the sale of homes.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it would not be easy for non-UK persons, as well as for foreign companies, to buy homes rather than British hard workers.
For so many people the dream of having a house has become almost impossible, and the lack of respect for the streets doesn't last."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest desire is to be a Scottish trainer'
The Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that he has a "great desire" to be a Scottish trainer one day.
Ross, aged 42, desires the challenge of helping the North-Eest group, now third in the League One, is left by the top three.
You have moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Merren to return to Scottsh Premiership the previous distress.
"I wanted to play my country while I was playing.
I got a B copy and thus ended," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I have grown up watching Scotland many times in Hammpden when my father was young, and it has been something I have always thought about.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as the trainer of a small group."
Primitive instructors in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allahyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, an Alloa Atlantic instructor, says that he did not hold back from joining the main instructors in this large group, since he has refused requests from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"What success for me now will be determined if 'I can restore this group to the Premirer League?'
Because of the structure and structure of the group, no doubt they should enter the Premirer League, he said.
"It's not easy for me to get back, but I'll probably consider myself successful where I can turn the group again."
Ross has been a teacher for only three years, after a short time as an assistant to the trainer in Dambarton and 15 months as a discipline worker in Herats.
He then helped Alloa escape from the sword, and turned St Merren who was almost consumed by the knife into Championship champions for the next town.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepolol, Falkirk, St Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
"The things suddenly changed completely," you remember, by training Alloa.
"I was fully convinced that training work is for me, more than being a player.
It sounds unreasonable because I could play well, enjoy a good life, and have fun.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to dealing with the stresses and pressures of the work, but I love the training.
I have long wanted to be trained and now do it, and I feel that I am now doing something I want to do all my life as an adult."

The appropriate moment for the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, says the review
During the summer, Britain’s fast - moving, yet fast - moving, taps were heavy enough to load food restaurants.
Doll and rubber groups have been raised by consumers by 2.7 percent by July - but in restaurants have dropped by 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of the silines constituency CGA, who has received these statistics, says: "The continued success and long involvement of England is expected in World Cup means that July has followed the same course as the last month of June, where the tubes have risen by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants to cry down.
The decline of 1.8 percent in sales in restaurants in June has been particularly severe in July.
Drinking outlets and barbs are more commercial than restaurants.
Lanterns are also heavily laden with food in the sun, although it has not been as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to get out of it will get a drink.
In the tubes and bars selling alcohol has increased by 6.6 percent during the month, the food dropped by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, a social analyst and hosting RSM, says: "These results continue what we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major events or sports will always be powerful reasons when it comes to selling in the market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to drag harder, although sales are reduced by 4.8 percent each year will be painful in spite of ongoing costs.
The long hot summer has come to the most bad of the food markets, and in time it will be seen that the low temperatures we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in the sales in restaurants and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a reduction in the number of bills.

One out of five children has secret accounts for their parents ’ connections
One of five - - - year - olds has private accounts in the chat rooms they have hidden from their parents and teachers, creates a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school - school students showed an increase in the pages of the "Insta false" pages.
The news media bring concern about the spread of sexually transmitted diseases
20 percent of people say that they have a "correct" account that shows children
One of the five - - year - olds opens chat rooms that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school - high school students showed rapid growth in the accounts "false in Insta" - referring to the Internet Xinstagram images network.
The news media bring to the fore the threat of sexual harassment.
Some 20 percent of those who claim to use a clean "true" account show their parents, while they have other secrets.
One mother who somehow saw her 13- year- old daughter's secret e-mail found a youth who asked others to ‘ rape her."
This study, of Digial Awares UK and Headmasters" and Headmistress (HMC) in private schools, has received 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 with two profiles, half of which admit that they have private accounts.
The director of HMC says: "It disturbs so many young people who are tempted to build accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers will not find them."
Eliidh Doyle will be the "word of the players" on the Scottish Attaltics board
Eliidh Doyle has been elected by the Scottish Attaltics as director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a popular Scottish player, and chairman Ian Beattie describes this act as a good opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from his wide million sporting events a decade ago.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all the players in the world, and we are sure that the Scottish sports will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I’m determined to be the voice of the players and hope to give more and help in directing sports in Scotland."
This American player, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics among his four Olympic rings and is now a regular BBC, finds himself unable to walk after stroke (TIA).
He wrote to Twitt: "Last month I suffered a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
The doctors said that in time, I would be shown whether I would recover or to what extent I was going to get better.
Eventually, I recovered sufficiently, I learned to walk, and today I was able to exercise!
Thank you for messages of encouragement!"
A mother - and - cow - feed campaign creates a break in the Internet.
The breast pumping company created a break on the Internet with a commercial message that compares the breast - feeding mothers to the beef cattle.
In order to mark the installation of the so - called "the first soundless breast pump in the world," Elvie’s client has produced a graturated video video presentation to show the new tap that he offers to nursing mothers.
Four mothers dance a song in a herd containing names, "Yes, I swallow myself, but you don't see the tail" and say, "If you didn't see this, my breasts are not.
The compass says, "Take him out, remove him, bring him out, feed him, cast him out, take him out, throw him out, and feed my friends."
However, this advertisement, printed on the Facebook page of the company, has created a controversy over the Internet.
The video with 77,000 who have seen it and hundreds of concretes has received different views from viewers, while many say that it looks down on the "weight" of the milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
As for us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to give forth milk, unless their babies are taken a few days after birth," writes another.
Elvie’s breast pump enters and is hidden inside the breast block (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It’s a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But then why don't you use to advertise with a breast pump that mothers are not able to keep their children?
Another said: "This advertising isn't suitable."
Some protected the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she got a song "laughing."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I were nursing it.
The pumping made me feel like a bull.
The advertisement is impressive, but I heard what it meant.
This product will really be useful," wrote another.
One has added: "This advertisement laughs and refers to mothers who pump (normally in the workplace or in private rooms) and feel like the "cows."
This is not a advertising that glorifies or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video a group of women showed that they had been dancing with hidden pipes under their bras.
The aim of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast - feed pumps say that they feel they are cattle.
But Elvie Pummp, without sound, has no strings or tubes and wears it hidden under the breastbrush, gives women freedom to move, take hold of their children, and pull them out of the pump.
Ana Barin, who is an ECD partner in the Mother, has noted: "Elvie Pummp is a product that will have a great impact and therefore qualified for its presentation in a clear manner.
By likening nursing women to cattle, we wanted to pump out the breasts and all its challenges in public, while showing in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of freeing the new pump that will bring it.
This was not the first time Elvie's pump was questioned.
In the middle of the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from the designer Carta Jabowski using this product.
Hundreds of immigrants move peacefully to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children taken out of exile has increased even though it has not changed the monthly number of those passing the border, in part because the tough police fitted by Trump’s office made it difficult to provide support for children.
Often, many sponsors have become passports, and they have been afraid to risk their own stay in this area by identifying themselves as a parent.
The risk has been serious in June, when the authorities announce that supporters and other adult members of the home will have to send a set of fingers, and that a tire will be given to the local authorities.
Last week, Mattthew Albence, chief executive of the Immmiral and Customs Enforcement, admitted before the Congress that this chain has bound many people who are registered to support children without parents.
The firm later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested were not guilty of crime.
"Almost 80% of non-conformists or family members are illegal in this treatment, and a large number are criminals.
So we keep looking for those people, ” says Mr. Albence.
In an effort to corrupt children quickly, the authorities have established new laws that will require some of them to appear in court during the month under arrest, not after 60 days, which were the former law, in accordance with the sheter workers.
Most will appear on the video network, not literally, to ask for legal rights on the arrival of the arrival judge.
Those considered unsuitable will soon be carried off.
If children stay in custody for long periods, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or to attempt to escape, in accordance with the sheter and the reports released from the system in the past months.
The lawyers say that the anxiety grows in a larger center, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s difficulty may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They also add that moving children to a tent without giving them time to prepare emotionally for themselves or to say good - bye to their friends can create many of the problems they already have.
Syria tells the US, France, and Turkey ‘ attacking ’ forces to quickly withdraw
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem has spoken to the Syrians to return home, even if the war in their country is now its eighth year.
Mouelem, also the chief minister's vice president, said that foreign troops were illegally in Syria, that they would put an end to terrorism, and that they would be dealt with correctly.
"He must leave immediately without subject," tell the audience.
Moulem asserts that ‘ the fighting against terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this holy battle and to cleanse the whole part of Syria" from terrorist groups and "anyone from abroad."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who concentrate on training and leading forces in Kurdish and Arabian Arabia against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war - torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moulem says that conditions allow them to return, and he blames "Some western countries" for making the refugees never return.
He said, "We have spoken to the international public and social organization to make sure that the refugees are returning."
"They are conducting politics on a matter that should be addressed only to the social welfare of the community."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help her Syria again until a political agreement has been made between Assad and those who oppose the end of the war.
UN delegates said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a border on the last great antiheretic fortress of the Idub has an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian and Turkish treaty has prevented major Russian - sponsored Syrian invasions in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulem stressed that the agreement was "appointed a clear time" and hopes that the soldiers will attack the Gistra Front soldiers and the Nustra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaedada, "will be wiped out."
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that you will soon arrange for the first meeting of a new committee that includes government and opposing members to form a legal charter after the war of Syria and plan the course of choice.
Moulem has imposed restrictions on the Syrian government to the committee, saying that the governor's work should be limited by "ensuring the articles of the new constitution," and warned against violating.
Why will Trump have a second choice?
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second choice in 2020 unless, as there are many tearsless viewers who may wish to be so, can be unfaithful and do the wrong that can replace him as president.
There is no doubt that "It will be the most decisive conclusion in the history of the president!"
Thus far, there are no signs of overcoming the subject.
Since 2014, the CNN viewing people have grown to 1.5 million and their view of MSNBCs has tripled to 1.6 million.
The Forx News usually has 2.4 million spectators, ranging from 1.7 million to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Show" has a high rate of 3.5 million viewers in hot night news.
"People are curious because it's not something we understand," said Nel Baer, director of the ABC drama program program called "Designated Survival," regarding the secretary of the Cabinet who became president after the attack of Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a red-ontributer in the field of writing and comics called "Just the Fulny Parts: And a Young Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Bodys," has another idea.
You remember riding a text in Boston before the 2016 selection.
The driver told him that he would hire Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because you make me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
It is fascinating to hear and watch.
Of course, unlike anything on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Waite, whether the immigrant families are getting along and the world economy.
Very few people do.
It is, therefore, more than if you find yourself sitting for more than six hours and watching the technical commission contradicting Bob Woodward’s use of a "deep background" in his book "Fear," a Paul Manafort’s coat worth $15,000 (" proud black garment, ” says Washington Post) and Stormy Daniels's graphic description of Mr. Trump. Trump.
I, for my part, would never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"One of his activities that makes it seem like a routine of human life is to give something every night," says Brent Montgomery, the Wheelhouse Interstate and the founder of "New Stars," talking about the change of people in Trump’s order and daily conversations (minning with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] outside his home in the northern coast of Kauai, but he was in the corner of the MNSNBC and recorded CNN.
It was unlikely that he would leave it before it, as the Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate, and the future of the High Court was uncertain.
"I remember doing all these wild programs in the past and people say, "This is the beginning of Western culture," says Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

The majority of the funds are installed in the Middle Ages of the House competition
Not surprisingly, 17 to 17 percent of the funds are received, thanks to the restructuring of the corngress, which have come out with two officers in the same seat competition.
This newly developed Pittsburg region put him in a competition Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is now running against another mound, Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the old Pennsylvania region of 12 Pennsylvania, which runs full of 17 new ones.
Maps were retyped after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old provinces violated the law by stealing votes to the Republicans.
The contest in this 17th new issue has removed the financial competition between members of the larger group, the Democratic Camping Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campal Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March that was observed by many people of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position had been occupied by Republican for over a decade, President Donald Trump won the valley by 20 seconds.
Politicians have given Democrats a measure of opportunity.
U.S. They considered punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, and Free
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had long noted Beijing, with little supplication from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and was at a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization.
The authorities of the State Department decided to call the U.S. officials of the iplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the ‘ current decision against Taiwan," Heather Neuert, who speaks for the door, says so at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador, with $140 million in helping America in 2017, and in controlling narcics, development and economic support.
A fixed fee, which includes financial cuts and sets limits on appellates, may be painful for the country of Central America as a result of increasing unemployment and murder.
As their conferences progress, officials from North America and Central America withdrew a high conference focused on protecting and economic development in order to follow the same gathering last year that was considered a step forward of efforts to prevent foreigners from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, leading officials made it clear that they wanted a conference to continue, effectively eliminating any idea of paying El Salvador.
President Mike Pence's office now has to arrange to speak to the council, now scheduled to be in the middle of October, as a sign brought to the summit, says the officials.
And the three representatives of the United States peacefully returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House of Mr. Bolton refused to note the details of the debate described by three American officers, including two delegates, who agreed to discuss the inner intentions of the state of secrecy.
Their accounts are verified by an external external client that is close to the rulers and spoke of the state of secrecy.
A Lesson From History
The following incident may be the report of a special counselor by Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's objection, and now there is much more evidence to the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign had been linked with Russia in its efforts to attack our choice.
If the Congress change, Mr. Trump will find himself facing cases in this body, as he prepares to appear before the voters, and perhaps finally before the court.
This has many limits, and it does not mean that Mr. Trump’s fall will definitely happen to his fellows in Europe.
There are decisions that all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic will affect the length of the exchange.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stop the coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed out on the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such events, and persistent striving for the will of the majority becomes powerful, or unsuccessful, for years.
Americans now face many of these.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosesstein had been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested writing privately to the president and mentioned his failure to do his work.
Mr. Rosenstein says the article of The Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the new requested inquiry of F.B.I. of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust — or if it is put in the High Court in spite of charges of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle era of the Congress to charge against Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the desire of the majority will not be satisfied for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once ruled my domain.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, after 60 years, sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on a sistica table.
With that as an inheritance, how is it possible that I have no hope for our future?"

Graham Dorrans hope as the game approaches with Rapid Vienna
Ringers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians, after a similar play in Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them at a good chance to pass through the Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevents stomach athlete Graham Dorrans from playing again in the pain until the game is equal to 2-2 to Villarreal but you believe that Ringers can use those effects to look forward to big things.
"It's good to find this point because Villarreal is a good playing team," says this 31 - year - old player.
"We went out in the drama believing that we would return with something and get the point.
We may have only one score at the end of the game, but, besides, the game is just as good as it is.
They played better with the first one, and with the second playing better.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope that we will get three points but will be a hard game because they have played well in the past but because our followers will be encouraging us, I’m sure we will play and get good results.
The past year has been difficult, during all that has happened with my injuries and changes in the group itself but it seems that things will get better now.
The group is wholesome and happy, and the training we receive is also rewarding.
We hope that we will work now, past the past tragedy and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because they fear the money they earn
Despite having had a clear view of their need for care, few people actually spoke to their families about it.
Almost half of the people in a global survey say that they talked to their mates about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but don't take the initiative to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance industry.
Let this be started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for that moment if you do not have time to talk to your children about your wishes.
Why not discuss with your family how you will receive the needed assistance and how to make ends meet, as those decisions may affect how much money a person has to offer?
Name your financial counselor: Your adviser can also help you to get on with your expenses.
Your long - term financial decisions may include a long - term plan of insurance, a life insurance policy that pays to cover these expenses or to become a health insurance policy — as long as you still have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Find a health - care project to appoint a trusted confidant and to make sure that doctors cooperate with your wishes if you are unable to speak.
Consider, too, the rule of attrony in your money.
You will choose someone whom you trust to make decisions for your money and make sure that your expenses are paid when you can no longer do anything.
Don’t forget details: Imagine your elderly parent who is in an emergency situation and is rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and health?
Put the information in order to make the needed effort.
"Not only are funds to be considered, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What trees?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a program available. "

Government prosecutors sought an unusual death sentence on the NYC accused of terrorism
The U.S. government prosecutors in New York sought the death sentence of the Safullo Saipov, New York City’s terrorist blame for killing eight people; an unusual court case that has never been repealed since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used the Home Depot to attack the West Side Higway bicycle route in Lower Manhattan, hit and killed people on foot and bikes in that way by October.
In order to make him a capital punishment, the prosecutors will have to show that the Saipov has deliberately killed eight people and has deliberately caused them physical harm, in accordance with the notice of the death sentence, published by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts carry the weight of the death sentence, in line with the court’s decision.
A few weeks later, the appeal court handed down 22 cases involving eight murder charges, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and automobile destruction.
The attack required "organization and good consideration," said the prosecutors, explaining how Saipov has done it as "wicked, cruel and horrible."
"Sayfullo Habulaevic Saipov has wounded, killed families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Arriel Erlij, Hernan Ferrruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dagnucco," says a court announcement.
Five victims were Argentine guests.
It has been ten years since the New York Southern District ended up handling the death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, is charged with killing two drug personnel but finally spent a lifetime in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence on the New York court was in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married people who were executed after being convicted were charged with the Soviet Union information during the Col War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown that he has no heart in the days and months that follow the attack, according to court statements.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov has told the authorities that the cause of his attack was to watch ISS videos on his telephone, in accordance with the words of the trial.
He also asked for a sign of ISIS in his hospital room, the police said.
He said he had no charge on the sides of which he was 22.
David Patton, public defense representative of Saipov, says "they are as disappointed as expected" for a court decision.
"We think the decision to seek a death sentence rather than accept a request to be sent to prison without a possible release will only ease the shock of these cases to all involved," says Patton.
The Saipov rescue team had asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
The Dory Manager says that NIGIFRAG should lead talks with Brexit
The Nigel Framege vowed 'organism' today during protests in the Tory Council.
A former Ukip leader says that politicians had to be ‘ tortured by Eurosceptics - since one of the public minister of Theresa May said he should be the head of the talks and the EU.
An office member Peter Bone has told the rioters in Birmingham that the UK may have been out now if Mr Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Nkkz May faces in gathering members of his divided group is marked by the older members of Tory who join a different protest against Brexit in the city.
The General is unable to keep his Chequers system of silence going well despite attacks by members of the Brexit, Remainers, and the EU.
Some members insist that they will continue trying to make a Brussels contract in the face of a conflict — and force the Eurosceptics and Labours to choose between his ‘ puzzle'.
Mr Bone has told the Leve Means Levave riot at Solihull that you want to ‘ finish with Cheques'.
He said that Mr Frame should be made a pillar and given work to contact Brussels.
'If it had been the one in charge,' he would have left now, saying.
This master of the Southlinqaugh has added: 'I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to finish with Chequers.'
Describing his disagreement with the EU, he says: ‘ We have not fought the wars of the world to become slaves.
We want to make our own laws for ourselves in my country.'
Mr Bone has published proposals that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed the mind and want to remain at all is not true.'
Andrea Jennings of Tory who supports Brexit was also on the riot, telling the surveyers: 'What I mean is: Sir, listen to the people.
'People don't want Chequers, the opposing group will not vote for them, our group doesn't want our people who are walking the streets and get us elected from the beginning.
Please forget Cheques and begin to listen.
In a straightforward sermon to Nkkz May, he said: 'The governor continues to carry out their duties when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the politician in the uprising that they must be ‘ pressed on their way ’ if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 draft.
‘ This is now a matter of loyalty between us - men and our political class, ’ he said.
'They are trying to be dishonest to Brexit, and we are here today to tell them, 'We will not let you do that'.'
In a strong order he told the crowd, 'I want you to make them a class of politicians, who are now in danger of breaking Brexit, feel oppressed.
‘ We are using the world force that has given us victory over Brexit and will not give up and become a independent, independent country, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers rioted in Birmingham before having a two - hour call in the city.
The principal prelates carried the Tories Against Brexit following the establishment of a group in the report.
A Labour member Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives of the safety problems they had with a group applet at the time the conference was opened.
'These people who tell us that they can put the IT and all the technology of Canada and others, the trouble - free border, free trade outside the borders of Ireland', adding.
‘ It’s a total destruction.
No item called Brexit is good, adding.
Warren's "Watching" Programs to enter president's selection
The U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says "to consider the intervention of the president's election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat spoke about its future in a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, always critical of President Donald Trump, joins the choice to be reregistered in November against GoP Rep. of the country Geoff Diehl, who served as assistant of Trump’s chairman in the 2016 Massachusetts project.
She was at greater risk that she could compete with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Hokuta was his 36th meeting using the city hall since Trump became president.
The one attending asked if you are planning to enter the selection.
Warren replied that it is time for the "women to go to Washington to correct our corrupt government, and that includes the woman who is to become president."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to gaining a planet’s best quality after following the party’s rules that led him to conquer Sebastian Vettel
It was only evident that Vallter Bottas succeeded beyond Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes party's guidelines will play a major role in the contest.
From the beginning, Bottas started well and likely argued with Hamilton as he protected his position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack a man of his group.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be stopped by the group's tail, which should have been the final decision.
Mercedes entered a pit after the cycle and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of the race that made the Ferrari driver be forced to leave the inside safely after two years of protection from the third eye.
Max Versappen started in the back line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21 birthday.
He then takes the lead in much of the race as he has continued with his wheels so that he can concentrate on finishing quickly and pass by Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth.
She finally comes to pits in the 44 cycle but has not been able to increase her speed in the remaining eight turns since Rainkonen is the fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valteri did a good work every weekend and was kinder than I did.
The group has done a commendable job to have 1,2," says Hamilton.
His Strain Is Rich
President Donald Trump has joked with the Senior Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting as he insisted that he had not shown a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the High Court of High Court of Brett Kavanaugh on cases of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of the testimony given by the Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but rather stated that what had happened to Senate has shown that people were ‘ unreasonable and unkind and dishonest.'
"One thing could happen with a good thing going on in the last few days of Senate, if you see anger, when you see people who are angry and unkind and unreasonable," says."
" When you look at the broken news and say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinsstein, have you told someone?
You remember her answer... Someone sent you the statement "Oh, Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have sent no one."
Well, wait one minute.
We have sent him... No, we have sent no one," says, referring to a solarator.
Feinstein was sent a detailed book on the Kavanaugh charge by Ford back in July, and it appeared early in September - but Feinstein denied that the document had come out of his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't send anyone," Feinstein tells the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it secret and have kept it as secret as you asked."
But his objection was not well understood by the president, who observed during the Saturday evening gathering: "This is what I will say, his physical movement is to the rich.
He may not have done it, but the movement of his body is a rich man.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court, accused of three women against abuse, the president said that Democrats used charges in their own interests.
"He is willing to fight for control of anything he can do.
He sees a lack of kindness, indifference, concern about who is at risk, who should go through to rule and control," reports the Mediaite, as the president's remarks.

In a game of several years earlier, Sullivan gave hope to a group that had been playing at home at 13: 10 before Matt Marquardt sent a ball to Cownie when he hit the counter at 15:16.
Dwyer has made sure that the Giants take the lead when they go on vacation when they hit his second team that day toward the end of the first grade.
The team that was playing at home is back in power, and Bouchard once again struck a fine line of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have met to help Nieelsen hit the Dundee champion for the first time in the game toward the end of the second blow and made sure that they won the game by playing the fifth at the end of the game.
The Giants, who have now been killed in their games for the past five years, played at home with Milton Keynes on their next Friday.

"Our hearts are pained to hear of this," he has added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll can reach thousands, as health services to the disaster say that it is not easy to enter the cities of Donggala, Sig, and Boitong.
"We believe that the number of dead is still increasing as many corpses are still under rubble while many were unable to reach them," says French commentator Sutopo Proo Nugroho.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] of waves destroyed Pallu that will have many people's funeral on Sunday.

Are you ready?" Save the CNN.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people died.

The airline that controls a wreck in the Pacific ragoon in Micronesia now says that there is one missing person, after all 47 passengers and crew on board are safely discharged from the landing plane.
Air Niugini has said that since Saturday afternoon, she will not be able to tell about a male passenger.
Airline says that she has worked with local officials, hospitals, and inspectors to try to find the man.
Airline did not respond immediately when asked to reveal details about this passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats have helped other passengers and crew after flying into the water while attempting to sail on the Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said 7 people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
Airline states that 6 passengers remain in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in good condition.
What caused the plane crash and how it happened is not clear.

American passenger Bill Jayes said that the cloud was flying in the water at a low speed.
"That's really good," says Jayne.
Jaynes says that he and the others were able to sail in water that kept their waist on to the emergency exits.
He said that the flight attendants were anxious and talking, and that he was partially injured on his head.
U.S. Navy says that sailors working nearby promote the wharf also when rescue is launched by using a passenger boat to reach the shore before the plane sinks to a depth of 100 feet [100 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 11 people have died in a disaster of PNG-reputed airlines over the past 20 years but none include Air Niugini.
Analyst cites the night of a woman who has been burned alive
The prosecutor charged on Saturday a man's case against a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for many hours as an expert witness in the field of critical lysis.
He explained to the judge's jury how he used the phone records to find the places that 29- year - old Judge Quinton Tellis and 19-year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett has found details about the location of several telephone lines that indicated that Tellis had Chambers on the afternoon of his death, contradicting what he said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in Chambers during the time he said he had a friend; then Michael Sanford, the police went to talk with Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was true when he said he was on the Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "poundering because his truck was in Nashville."
One of the exceptions is that Tellis said he had known Chambers two weeks before he died.
Phone records indicate that they were dating for one week.
Rowlett says that at some point before the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the Sendler emails, telephones, and communications information.
"He brought him out of his life," says Hale.
The complaint is arranged to start speaking on the Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be made with the jury that day.
High Breed: What is conscius hip?
This hip group wants to challenge such negative views by filling their songs with encouraging words.
High Breed, from Bristol, says the hip hop is no longer what it was at first by having political messages and talking about social problems.
It wants it to return to the system and make a long name for its conscious hop.
Singers such as The Futures and Commons have later seen an increase in UK in groups such as Alaka and Lowkey.
Another black man?
Child guard in NY accuses parents of sending her away with a message that shows ‘ prejudice. ’
A child guard in New York accuses a man and his wife by putting him out with prejudiced words after receiving a message from the mother of the child who came in by the mistake of saying "She was another black man."
The parents deny that they are prejudiced, claiming that the charges are made for the ‘ profit' purpose.
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, you who have two children, expressed concern when he found out that he was going to watch his little child, Gisille Maurice, a black man when he arrived on his first day to work in 2016.
" NOOOOOOOOM," writes Nkkz Plasco-Flaxman in writing to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Msz, Maurice, two times.
After seeing her manager, the "not free" Plasco-Flaxman has dismissed Mksz. Maurice, who has been watching her children who have been walking, is African-American, has done an unpleasant job and has been waiting for a Filipino, according to New York’s Past.
Msz. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then moved home in Uber.
Now, Maurice blames parents for the unfair expulsion of her parents, and she needs the payment of $350 for her six months, as well as the live-in gig, without a bribe.
"I wanted to show, see, that which was not done," telling Post on Friday, adding, "I know you're prejudiced."
The parents answered that they were prejudiced, saying that to drive Maurice away was a good thing they had done, fearing that they would not trust her after she had mistreated her.
"My wife sent you something that you didn't mean to say.
He is free from bias or favoritism.
We are not prejudiced," says husband Joel Plasco, telling Post.
"But can you leave your children and the person with whom you have been rude, even mistaken?
Your newfound child?
In fact.."
Comparing this accusation with the "refuture of money," Plasco says his wife had been having a child for two months, and was in a very difficult situation."
"Will you attack such a person?
That's not a good thing, "Investment canker."
As the trial progresses, the open - minded court is quick to accuse the parents on a social network, not encouraging what they have done.
The publisher of Paddington was afraid that students would not like this speech file, revealed the newspaper
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was popular, said in a book: "It’s hard to put yourself in a person’s shoes for the first time before it was printed.
It is a pleasure to know now what we know about Padding's success.
He says that his father, who has worked in BBC as a photographer before being moved to write a book about a small toy bear, would not be discouraged if his work was not popular, adding 60th anniser's printing of his books to be "pain and fun" after his death last year.
As to Paddington, which he described as "the most important family value of our family," he added to his father who was not proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and was not proud, telling them."
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had done something: you are proud of it even if it didn't work for you.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Even if he was invented and thought about him, he always commended Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to phone her
When her daughter was sent to the Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to mean that it is too bad, that he doesn't expect to survive," says Mrs. Ednan-Lapehouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad saying that he would die two minutes since now, and I had to say good - bye to him.
And I said good - bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, and don't be quiet."
I will be with you in the near future.
I will be with you.
The medications prescribed for her heart condition slowly deteriorated and her body died.
She had died some time before, and this was no longer working.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be truly self - controlled.
Eventually Mrs. Edna-Lapehouse, who now mourns her dead daughter, took an airplane with other passengers clearly because of the desperate situation she was facing.
"No one knew," he told them.
"I looked down, and tears fell all the time.
It is hard to explain, but this is the time when I felt sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved her.
A woman picks up cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in death worked together to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been carrying cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use for help.
The son of Nksz Davis was in his early teens when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," says Mrs. Davis.
Nksz Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a cook who had a promise for the future and when he greeted everyone.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said that when you smile, all is good."
Nevertheless, she quit her job before she died, since she was very depressed.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the first to find him after committing suicide.
Mksz Davis said, "I always worry that something will happen about the same thing."
Nksz Davis started making cards, "to let people know that they can talk to them, even if they are friends.
Don't shut down your feelings and talk.'
Nksz Humphreys, a friend of Nksz Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15- year- old manager, just after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he felt low or depressed or said something," he relates.
"A few days before Christmas we noted a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was on the ground in one way or another when the children opened their presents he didn't look at them or do anything."
He said that his death was extremely difficult for them, but they had to cope with it: "A large door of opportunity is opened to the family.
It causes great pain.
But we must all continue to fight.
If it is difficult to cope with the loss, you can call the Samaritan free of charge in the 116,123 (UK and Ireland), e-mail yo@saritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website.
The future of Brett Kavanaugh was not guaranteed as the FBI initiates a search
"I thought, if we could actually find something similar to what she was looking for - a quick search, a hundred-may bring a low match," says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that she was afraid that the committee would be "divided" as many do not.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican sponsors want the FBI do research?
The reason for their procrastination is related to time.
The middle term will reach five weeks, November 6 - U.S. date, as expected, the failure of the Republicans, and then will be weakened in their efforts to find the person who wants to be selected from the highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling on Senators, encouraging them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who was working at White House for Mr Bush and there he met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr Bush.
What happens when the FBI has published its message?
There will be a Senate selection, consisting of 51 Republics and 49 Democratics.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain about 50 votes from Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president's vice president, to divide the equality and put him in the Supreme Court.
North Korean heretics were ‘ shrinking ’ under Kim
The number of rebels from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, says a South Korean law specialist.
Park Byweong-seug, quoting the details of the South Coalition department, says that last year there were 1,127 rebels - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that border regulations are enforced between North Korea and China and the high cost of underground import workers has a great impact.
Pyongngang observed nothing in the community.
A large number of rebels from the North eventually gain the rights of citizens in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 33,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled toward China, which has a long link with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarialized Zone (DMZ) with protection between two Koreas.
China considers these rebels to be nonconformists, not refugees and often sends them back to their countries with forced labor.
The relationship between the North and the South currently at war in some sense has improved dramatically over the past months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of these two countries met in Pyongang and discussed the development of nuclear arms.
This occurred after the historic June convention between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several methods of nuclear disarmament in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed the US authorities for taking action since then.
"Unless the US is confident, there will be no hope for the security of our country and under those circumstances, we will never stop our weapons alone first," says Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelousi calls Brett Kavanaugh "under the emotions," saying that he is unfit for service at the Supreme Court
The commander of the Small House Group, Nancy Pelousi, calls the choice of the High Court to be selected by Brett Kavanaugh as a "defiled of emotions" and said that his emotions do not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelousi says these words in a Saturday discussion in Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if a woman ever acted in this way, then it would be said to be ‘ controlled by feelings,' said Pelosi with her answer to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senaciaciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied that she had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at an early age.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh spoke and expressed emotions, among other things, as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also published the Democrats to the committee, calling the charges against them "Man-widely distorted information to be executed" arranged in an angry fashion that Hillary Clinton was defeated in the 2016 election.
Pelousi believes that Kavanaugh's evidence shows that you will fail in the High Court, since it shows that you are against the Democrats.
"I think he doesn't fit in with those words and how he speaks about the Clinton and Democrats," says.
Pelosi refused when asked if he would try to accuse Kavanaugh if put, and that Democrats received many seats from the House of Representatives.
"Behold, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, it means that he is not qualified not only in the Supreme Court, but also in court to be present," says Pelousi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. C.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat he is concerned that Kavanaugh may judge against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Away, as he is thought to be the judge who is responsible for it.
When questioned, Kavanaugh gave no answers to the questions of whether he could answer some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional person to go to court and be expected to say, 'until it is right,' says Pelousi.
Women And Need to Exercise Their Power.
Proper criticism, months, and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to cast you off without tears.
"We cry when we're upset," Msz. Stein told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an offender, who said that she cried when she was upset, but found a suggestion that when she was upset and cried, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You may think I’m upset because I cry."
I’m angry.'
Then he proceeded.
And I think that's good.
Tears often flow as a result of human suffering.
One of my memories in the first job, the office that was full of men, when I found myself crying for anger that I could not describe, was picked up in the clattery on my neck to which I was always afraid to be pulled off the stairs.
"Make sure they don't see you cry at all times," she told me that.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you are upset and will be happy because they have found it."
Patricia Schroeder, was a Democratic constresswoman from Colorado, and worked with Gary Hart in his favor.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught committing adultery in a vessel called Monkey Business and was released from election, Msz. Schroeder, in a fit of rage, saw to it that he would not fulfill his desire to enter the election as president.
"It wasn't a well- thought decision," she said to me when she was laughing 30 years later.
"Before there are seven others in the race, and a joke is waiting for another one.
One is called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, she had no money to compete, so she promised she would not enter the race until she had $2 million.
It was a war I could not win.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $11,000 million from men could give him $250.
"Do they think I get a fine?" she asked.
When he announced that he would not engage in an organized campaign, he was overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude for the people who had supported him, the frustration of the circus that made it difficult for him to gather funds and seek vote for votes instead of looking for members, and anger over discrimination against women who had been caught up in them.
"You would think I was crazy," recalls Mrs. Schroeder and how the media responded to him.
"You can think that Klenex will be a pop point.
I remember thinking, ‘ What will they do to my grave? ’
"Did you cry "?"
How a war between US and China can be profitable in Beijing
Salvos that open trade between the US and China were close to hearing, and as the war is far from the end, the exchange between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the US, gave the first warning early this year by selling goods sent to China, including electric, steel, and aluminium.
The largest event took place in this record by new $200 million - worth libraries, by filling up half of all US items from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, recently placed between 5 and 10 percent of the American cost of $60 million.
China has asked for an average US, and the second - largest economy in the world is less likely to fall soon.
To make Washington shrink off means to close the corner with its demands, but bowing down to the US can be a great embarrassment to Xi Jinping, president of China.
Nevertheless, researchers say that if Beijing can act wisely, the pressure of the war to trade with the US can reap China for a long time by reducing the interaction between both parties.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that can cause economic problems in both countries is more dangerous than those people have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a senior researcher in Asia in the Center for New American Security, a mental area.
Syria is ‘ ready for the return of the refugees, ’ says the Foreign Minister
Syria says he is ready to return to the refugees and seek help to rebuild a war - torn country for seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al-Moulem says that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation in this world is calm and safe because of the progress made against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore victims ’ lives to normal areas.
All circumstances now allow for the willing return of refugees to a land where they had to flee because of terrorism and the oppressive economic systems that plagued their daily lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syriac people have fled this area since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other 6 million people still living in this area need material help.
Al-Moulem said that the kingdom of Syria could enjoy the help of rebuilding a war - torn land.
But he insisted that they would not accept legal aid or help from lands associated with the revolution.
Europe won a victory over the Ruder Cup in Paris
The European team won a victory in 2018 the Ruder Cup by defeating the USA team with 16.5 - 10.5 points on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now been fed six times in Europe and has never won the Ruder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has again received this prize as the Danish captain gang Thomas Bjorn reached 14 points it had needed to conquer the United States.
The US advisor Phil Mickelson, who had been heavily loaded for almost all this contest, put his to-do-shot in the water on par-3 hole of 16, his game was won by Francesco Moninari.
The Italian golf player Moninari has played well on all his shows, being 1 in 4 to 5-0 since the current match date began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth is released at 5&4 by the lowest player in a European group, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top player, Dustin Johnson, was divided into two and 1 by English Ian Powerter, who may have been playing in his last Ever Cup.
The first of the eight Rudder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia won more than any other event in Europe on 25.5 points.
"I rarely cry, but today I can't hold back.
This was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me, and he can't trust me.
I am very happy, happy to have a cup again.
We work for the team., and I am happy I have been able to help," says Grcia after winning a European victory.
She transfers a job to her cousin John Ram who has broken the US's guillote Tiger Woods in 2&1 to a single performer on Sunday.
"I am really proud, by breaking Tiger Woods, and growing up watching him," says 23- year old Rahm.
Woods has won all four of his four games in France and now has a 13-2-3 record on the Ruder Cup record.
Unique figures are one of the most famous players in history, which has overcome 14 major matches that fall on the second time for Jack Nicklaus alone.
The USA team has carried hardly a whole weekend to get nailies other than Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played high - level golf throughout the race.
US captain Jim Furryk has spoken after his group's uncomfortable game, "I’m proud of our players, have worked.
There was a time in the morning when we had to suppress Europe.
We didn’t.
Thomas has worked.
He is a fine captain.
All 12 players are very good at playing.
We're going to fix it, and I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be a captain.
You should advise your captain.
We're broken off."
