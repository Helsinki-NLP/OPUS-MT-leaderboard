Parliament counselors are concerned with the matter of ‘ looking foolish'
There is confusion among Parliament counselors who feel that their head should change as MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has come as a result of a change in the name of the convention as the Welsh Parliament.
Counseling counsel on how to deal with social and political issues may be put to the test by law.
A member of the Boour Parliament said that his organization was concerned that it would be "sounded like Twp and Pp."
For readers on the outside of Wales: The Welsh tup means the basics and pwp means a mouse.
A member of the Plaid Parliament said that the whole group was "not happy" and created other options.
One of the Welsh Conservative said that his group was a ‘ open mind ’ with the change of the name, but they realized that it was a short statement from MWP to Muppet.
In this case Welsh w is mentioned as well as the spelling in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Department, which is currently forming the constitution, said: "The final resolution in choosing what members of the House of Commons are to be considered by those members."
The Treaty of Welsh of 2017 authorized the Constitution to change the name of the Welsh Parliament.
In the month of June, the Commission produced the results of human research in which it found that people agree with the idea of changing the building’s name into a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the House of Commons, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Mempers or WMPs, but the MWP theory received much support in discussions with the public.
Amms seem to make other choices, but the struggle to achieve unity can be a real problem for Leader Elin Jones, who is expected to pass an unconstitution on during a number of weeks.
The law of the amendment also includes adjustments in the legal system, including regulations in removing Law counselors and the structure of the committee.
Parliament's counselors will receive the final vote on the question of what the building will be called after the legal discussion.
The Macedonians have gone to vote in order to change the world’s name
People will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country as "The Republic of North Macedonia."
The famous race was set up to cope with a long - standing struggle against neighboring Greece, in its area of Macedonia.
Athenas has insisted that the name of their northern neighbors obscures the significance of the region and repeatedly refused to participate in a request to enter the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the idea of a change of name, said that he would not vote.
However, those who want the name to be changed, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are said to have changed the name as a price to pay passage into the EU and NATO
St. Martin’s Silenced by Harlem Churches
"According to history, the adults I spoke to have said there were drinking and church places everywhere," said Father Adams.
"Now, there's no such thing."
He also said that the absence of alcohol would make sense.
"People are having different social contacts today," he said.
"Bedbies are not places where people go frequently."
As far as congregations are concerned, they are concerned that the sale of goods will not be as high as the leaders expect, "and soon they will return to where they started."
He also said that churches could be replaced by tall buildings filled with communities that would not be able to support the rest of the sanctuary.
"Many of the people who will buy the rooms built by the Europeans," said "and why is it speeding up the day these congregations will be closed together because most of the people who move there will be members of these churches."
All these churches were founded by the Western Church before the arrival of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and after ten years by St. Martin.
The first Western Methodist congregation was out of the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of black people who worshiped nearby had seized the building.
St. Martin's was adopted by the black congregation under the supervision of Lev. John Howard Johnson, who led a wave of merchants at 125th Street, the main shopping route to Harlem, who refuse to hire or promote black people.
The fire that had erupted in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when Mr. Johnson’s followers prepared the building, they set up a number of bells.
Father David Johnson's son Johnson is next to St. Martin's, proudly called the set bells of the poor.
The scholar who filled the flowers in July called one of them: "The cultural treasure" and also the "undecidable archaeological instrument."
Scholar Tiffany Nga of the University of Michigan, also notes that these are the world’s first bells to be played by black musician Dionyo A. Lind, who moved to the castle at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merweather said St. Martin'ss was not replaced.
What has happened to St. Martin's in recent months has been a challenge for architects and mechanics, some of them brought on by lay church leaders, others by Episcopal disaster.
The regular parish council, made up of private leaders - wrote letters in July of July, is concerned that the synod "needs regular church members to pay the money spent", although the church members did not always participate in the work of the architects who were sent to work on the project.
Some church members have always complained about the lack of practice.
Shark injured a 13 - year - old swimming child in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday who was performing swimming in Calliphona on the first day of swimming, said the authorities.
The attack occurred before 7: 00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was performing swimming with his friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy cry out for help and then went up with the party to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that at first they think I’m always picking on the chickens, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'I’m shot!
I’m upset!'
Through her face, "Hammel said he realized this as soon as he came to where the boy was.
"I called everyone to get out of the water: 'M' has a shark!' Hammel added.
The boy was taken by plane to the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was registered on the side of the intensive care unit.
The kind of shark that hurt him was unknown.
Lary Gilles said at a press conference that sharki was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed that it was not of harmful nations.
Gilles added that the victim had been seriously injured on land.
The authorities closed their reach on the coast from Pontus Beach in Casabald to Swami Xinitas for 48 hours to investigate and develop local security systems.
Miles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many seem less dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to set up a beauty market in the UK market
Sainbury's competition with other merchants such as the Bots, the Superrug, and the Debenhams, who have stores with beautiful sections and shelves that have other professionals to help.
As a section of the UK beauty market for $28bn, which continues to increase the time when the market for clothes and household items is moving backward, a beautiful department store has been tested in 11 stores throughout the country and goes to other stores in the morning.
The idea of entering a beauty business came about because the markets are looking for the use of cables that are used on TV, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's note can double the size of jewelry that has been donated to 3,000, including in such types as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Sales from L'Orel, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also find many places with symptoms similar to those found in shops like Bots.
This market also produces a Shope to sell cosmetics so that many things will be in harmony with people who do not eat the meat that young buyers so desperately need.
In addition, Fraser Shop’s perfume vendor will try to sell in two stores of Sainbury's, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, the last week and the second opened at Holy Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Buying on the Internet and adapting to buying small meals each day in nearby stores means that the market must do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief of Sainbury's, says that the market will seem to have sections that have many branches trying to fight the Aldi shop that reduces prices and Lidl provides more and more than food.
Sainsbury's establishment of Argos's markets has been placing the Argos market in hundreds of stores and has also established a number of residences since it bought two branches over the past two years, which say it has increased the sale of stores and has made the market more profitable.
The recent store’s experiments to remodel its beauty and medicine - market operations have failed.
Sainsbury's attempts to cooperate with Bots in the first years of the 2000, the firms had ended after a misunderstanding that they could divide money from the drug stores in its main market.
The new method came after Sainsbury sold his 281 drugstore at Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for a cost of $125, three years ago.
Lloyd was also said that he should share in this work, adding to the many types of skin treatment, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business executives in Sainbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and sounds of our beautiful gates to decorate the shopping area.
We have also used large amounts of money from well - trained friends who will be present to provide the printing press.
Our kind of merchandise has been designed to conform to any need and to the beauty and comfortable environment to mean that we are now an interesting environment that is opposed to the old method of buying."
Peter Jones was're angry because of Holly Willoughby’s loss of $111 million in cash.
An expert at Dragons Den Peter Jones was left to be angry 'because of the release of TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby on a £11 million of his high - quality business to care for his new relations with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to manage the Truly business to sell home clothes and other items.
These two businesses were likened to the Gwyneyth Palmrow, a Goop business.
A 37 - year - old producer of This Morning, went to the Instagram to announce that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby had left Peter Jones of the Droan Den's skill in anger for leaving the marketing union has a good advantage at the last time - to care for his new relations with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones "was upset when this TV talented girl admitted at a tough Tuesday meeting at her business center at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new union - has a cost of £1.5 million - has a charge that she did not have time to run a Truly business selling clothes and other items.
This business was likened to the Gwyney Paltrow of Goop and was encouraged to get a profit of £11 million Willoughby’s wealth.
When Willoughby, 37 years of age, went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to his vacation house.
The source said: "Truly was the most important of Holly’s priorities.
This was his long - term future that would have made him useful for several decades to come.
His argument left virtually everyone involved when he was surprised.
No one can believe what was going on on on Tuesday, just ahead of time.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that the departure of the founder of This Morning, one of Britain's most trusted artists, can cost the multibillion - dollar business because of the high cost of sales, such as kitchens and kitchens, as well as the early possibility of starting a business.
And it can refer to the end of the lifelong friendship.
Willoughby’s mother of three children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been the missionary partner of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp started Truly in 2016 and Jones, at the age of 52, climbed like a chair in March.
The family has one holiday, and Jones now owns a 40 - percent - percent TV company in Baldwin.
Willoughby is the vice president of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV visitor on the program I'm A Celebrity.
The source is near Jones that last night "We can't say anything about his business."
The reason was 'So we fell in love'
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the media for making comments that might be considered "no leader" and that he was sure of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump go so far?
Trump spoke in the words of his comics.
"I gave nothing."
She also said that Kim wanted to be present for the second assembly after her first convention in Singapore in June which Trump said was the major nuclear field in North Korea.
But arguments about nuclear disarmament have been stopped.
More than three months after the June convention in Singapore, the president of North Korea Ring Ho told world leaders in the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has seen me ‘ acts of likes" from the U.S. from what North Korea did at the beginning in arms.
Rather, he said, the U.S. still administers forced discipline.
Trump had high hopes of what he said at the convention.
"We're doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have a very good relationship.
They also said that their efforts to maintain good relations with Kim had resulted in much more success than in experimenting with traditional karate weapons, causing them to be released from prison and to return to the U.S. Army.
And he had smoothed out his strange way of speaking about friendship with Kim.
"I'm easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter the stadium, we have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd that was closing in front of him.
The Tsunami and the Incontinence of Indonesia Ruining the Island, as well as the mass slaughter that took place
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they are not needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok’s population had been affected by their environment, no world disaster had been reported, needed for worldwide aid.
"Many times, unfortunately, it seems that she is not asking for help from other countries, and I'm a little harder," said Sister Sumbung.
While the Save the Children move to Palu, it is not clear whether these foreign workers will be allowed to work.
Mr. Sutopo, who addresses disasters, say that Indonesian authorities are trying to see if the situation in Palulu has been allowed to provide help.
In spite of many earthquakes occurring in Indonesia, the country is not fully prepared for natural aggression.
Although tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are unusual in some beaches.
The shortage of sire to warn people of a tsunami in Palulu, although the warning had already been sounded, must have contributed to the loss of life.
In times of silence, traveling between most of Indonesia’s islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make travel extremely difficult.
The hospital boat that was abandoned in Lombok to heal victims is heading to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the time of the new disaster.
President Joko Widdo encouraged organizing construction projects in Indonesia as an important part of the election campaign, and he has donated large sums of money for roads and railways
A financial crisis, however, has affected the government of A Joko and that needs to be reintroduate the next year.
Joko too is experiencing the same difficulties because of the religious unrest in Indonesia, where many Muslims have adopted the same religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have left their homes while Christian and Muslim terrorists fight in the streets, using knives, arrows and arrows, and other useless weapons.

Cromwell’s picture in Parliament is the last reminder hit by a ‘ attempt to change history'
The ban will be a fair one because of the terrible destruction of Taban as well as the moral and religious practices of many England by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society defined Father Crick's feelings as "foolishness" and also as“ trying to change history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the elimination of images to prevent the discovery of the artifacts of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster’s Royal Palace.
The image of civil wars in England is neither controlled nor controlled by the Cromwell.
Perhaps this wrong Cromwell would be offered as a sacrifice because of what Thomas ’ grandfather did a century ago.
The beautiful Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th - century thinking as well as a part of the history of one who is still believed to be loved.
A Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as a civil rights activist against pressure from outsiders, in his case of a king.
Whether I can show the whole story in full detail, this long - standing argument is ongoing.
The fact is that the conflicts of the 17th century have changed the development of our country, and Cromwell is a well - known man who is losing part of the territory.
What he has done as the Lord of Protection is also necessary to celebrate and remember."
A Chinese farmer was bitten and killed by pigs
One farmer was bitten and killed by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, known by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a broken vein, filled with blood near the market in Lippanshui in Guizhou, South China Morning Post, said Sunday.
A hog farmer is planning to shoot a vaccine in a pigs home on May 30, 2005, in Xinging in Qinghai, China.
He said that he had traveled with his cousin from the area near Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found the door of a nearby pigs ’ house open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
Legal research confirmed that 550 pounds of rice killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," in the thorax, named "Wu," said, as described by Guinginging Evening News.
The security pictures portrayed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
An hour later, his body came back to normal.
The lion that killed the victim was not Yuan’s or her cousin.
The store manager told Every News that the dog was closed was protected against anyone, while the police had gathered evidence at the site.
The Yuans and the local authorities are said to have a discussion on how to pay for his death.
Although not all of it is common, reports of destructive pigs exist.
In 2016, the pigs injured the mother and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-possal pig shot a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened the dog.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a man in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive but the blood quality can be as a ‘ cause. ’
"It's fun.
Like children, they are eager to know... they don't want to harm you.
You should show them proper respect, "So she did.
The remains of Rosa’s typhoon will bring heavy rainfall to the south of the US
As foretold, the wind Rosa weakens as she travels along the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa brings up flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, the First Storm Force, beginning at 5 o’clock on Sunday, and was 385 miles [385 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low - winding area is being begun in the Pacific Sea and moving east toward the West Coast in the U.S.A. as Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday while a storm is beginning to blow up the north east of the U.S.
Rosa will bring ten more rain to another location in Mexico Monday.
Later, the cold heat that is close to the cold winds can bring much rain to the south in the following days.
In the area, 1 to 4 rain forests can cause flooding, the carrying of garbage and rising land in the desert.
The deep snow causes the rainfall to reach 2 to 3 acres per hour, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
Rain from 2 to 4 is expected to fall to the south of the west, especially in most of Arizona.
Flooding may be caused by things getting worse because of the rain falling in the tropical environment.
Walking in the wilderness can be dangerous because of the tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn small rivers into major rivers with torrential waters and torrential rains resulting from storms and dust.
The approaching cyclone will bring heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Southern California.
More than half the rain falls, which can cause less garbage and narrow roads
This becomes the first rain in this region during their rainy season.
The torrential rains of the region begin to fall on Arizona at the end of Sunday and on the beginning of Monday, just before Monday and Tuesday.
A torrential downpour swells the Four Corns on Tuesday and ends on Wednesday.
October can be hot - weathered throughout the U.S. region, where the Arctic has become colder, but the tropical climate will still be warmer.
This sometimes results in hot weather over short distances.
There is a good example of hot spots in different parts of the US Sunday.
There are about 20 degrees of hotness between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the hot summers are also trying to increase.
Most areas of the Central and the East of the US are expected to see from October and the spread of 80 degrees from the South Valley to other parts of the Far East.
New York City can reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C], which may be about 30 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C] more frequently in its city.
Our forecast of a long period points to the greater possibility of global warming in the East of the U.S. within half of October.
More than 20 million persons saw the debate in Brett Kavanaugh’s case
More than 20 million people have seen six sets of television Brett Kavanaugh who has been appointed to the Supreme Court to testify his fourth testimony by Christine Blasey Ford who accuses him of the sexual abuse that has occurred during the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, the political struggle continues, and the media are immediately disrupting a full - time session of Friday’s final session: an article prepared by Sen Arizona Flake for a one - week trial.
Ford told the Senate Committee that he is a 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had caught him and tried to take his clothes from the high school.
Kavanaugh, in an open - air testimony, said that he had a 100 - percent assurance that this had not happened.
It seems that 20.4 million people like Niesen predicted Friday had seen this happening.
The company was counting the number of television stations at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other figures were not available immediately on the other computers that featured the program, including PCS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often has trouble identifying the number of users in the offices.
To understand this correctly, the growth of the audience was comparable to that of the ones playing ball or graduation programs.
Fox News Channel, whose TV reporter agreed with the Kavanaughed election, exceeded the total number of the 5,69 million viewers and viewers throughout the day, said Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3,26 million spectators.
CBS consisted of 3.1 million, NBC had 2.4 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CN had 2.2 million, said Niesen.
The excitement of the end of the story continued to mount.
Flake was particularly important during Friday events.
After the central Republican office announced that she would vote Kavanaugh, she was photographed by CNN and CBS Friday morning cameras being exposed by opposers at the time she wanted to take a carriage to the assembly of the Justice Committee.
She had been standing and looked down for a few minutes, embarrassedly at the CNN film producer.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he’s right to the world?
She was told, "You have power, and most women are powerless."
Flake said that it gave notice and said that before the baggage was closed, he would have much to give a talk at a committee.
The Internet and television were immediately addressing the matter in the following hours, while the Governing Body had to vote in order to accept the decision of the entire Senate to vote
Flake said that this would be done if she had better understood what the FBI had published in an investigation of these chosen ones the following week, which few Democrats were encouraged.
Flake agreed slightly with her partner, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After interviewing Coons with several satellites, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had power, for it was evident that the Republican would not have any votes to accept Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has the FBI maneuvers to investigate cases involving Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister of May denounced opposers as ‘ political players ’ and the case of Brexit
The British Prime Minister Theresa May had condemned the antipathy from the European Union to the future of Britain and to interfere with the secular needs of the world in communication with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party convention in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In conversation near the front page of the newspaper, his former clergyman Boris Johnson continued to disagree with his plan known as the UK Future at Brexit, saying that the idea that Britain and the EU would receive money for each other's money was a " in vain."

The Department appreciates the retreating team of Louisiana State Police, a State police station, the South University police and local citizens to assist in the investigation for the arrest.
The director of LSU Joe Alleva praised the law officials for working ‘ diligently and following justice.'
Sims was 20 years old.
A six --6 - year - old athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
They found an average of 5.6 points and had the privilege of restricted 2.6 games in the late field.
On Friday morning, LSU a Will Wade's basketball teacher said that the group was "gried" and "difficulous" by the death of Wayne.
"This is what you always complain about," said Wade.
A volcanic eruption in Mexico City
The eruption from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost part of Mexico’s capital.
The World Security Council warned Mexico not to come near the volcano on Saturday, when the volcano once again exploded in the valley, and for 183 hours it was air - conditioned by ash.
This agency was concerned with the complaining and trembling of the area.
Photos on movies portray a small ashtray that rises in the cars windows in Mexico City as Xichimilco.
Astronomers have seen an increase in the eruption of a volcano at 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the largest city since a 7.1 - magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The eruption known as "Don Goyo" has been in progress since 1994.
Police struggle against the Catalan sects before the anniversary of the liberation of the election
Six people were arrested at Barcelona on Saturday in the midst of an argument between anti - riot police and their rights, and when thousands of people joined in the argument for celebrating the day of the liberation of the Catalonian vote.
A group of anti-said anti-summers were thrown into the eggs and cast into the mud, causing black and dusty clouds in the streets that are often inhabited by visitors.
Violence was also started in the afternoon when the police used their crutches to stop the war.
For several hours the independent groups singing "Oswawawa, no forgiveness" had met with those who were in the union shouting, "Keep alive in Spain."
Fourteen people had received medical treatment from the minor injuries they were injured in the disaster, local journalists did so.
Safety threats still exist in the area of self - determination after one year from the decision of October 1 that was considered unacceptable by Madrid but was enjoyed by the Catalonian independent group.
The voters were more determined to be independent, even those who are opposed to isolation are less likely to go to vote.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote in the zone and create conflicts.
Independent groups set up camps and stayed overnight to discourage opposers from rioting in assisting the country’s police.
The exhibition was delayed but was forced to take place otherwise.
Some 68 - year - old Narcis Termes, an electrician with his wife, said that he no longer believed that Catalonia would be free.
"Last year we had a very good time.
I have seen my parents cry with joy in being able to vote, but we have turned back again," he said.
Although they have succeeded if they have had a little success in the election of the last December parties, Catalan groups have been fighting to begin the work this year with their well - known officers in solitary confinement or in prison waiting to be convicted for a trial due to allowing the election and declaring their freedoms.
Joan Puig, 42 - year - old mechanics who had recorded the exhibition with the police on their telephone, said the conflict was with politicians on all sides.
"They are becoming more dangerous," he said.
On Saturday, Orriol Junquiras, one of nine Catalon leaders who were in prison before the trial since the end of the last year, announced that they would share in the collection of members of the Parliament in Europe the following year.
"Being a voter in Europe is one of the best ways to strengthen the work against democracy and to oppress others what we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The men who were arrested knocked on a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested repeatedly in a Londonderry building.
At 19: 30 a.m., the scene was the Ballynard Crescent on Thursday C.E.
Det Inspector Bob Blemings said the damage was done at the doors of the building.
An ant can also be thrown into a car at a certain time.
Menga’s conquest won the Ringers team 1-0 spies against Livingstone.
The first mission of Dolly Menga made Livingstone’s team a success.
Livingston’s encouraging team surprised the Rings team and led Steven Gerard to a second defeat on 18 games as master of the Bibrox club.
Dolly Menga's success made the Gary Holt's team similar to the Irish team in the second section.
Gerard’s team continues to win at the Premirer League during this period, and next Sunday they will meet with the largest Hearts team, followed by eight football fields.
Before the event, Rangers will play with Rapid Vienna in Europe the fourth.
Livingston, at present, is adding the game that has won to six games, and the director of the soccer Holt has not won since she replaced Keny Miler in the past month.
Livingston’s team wastes opportunity to resist visitors
The Holt team must have been in advance before the end of the war, with their development of a soccer team in Rings.
Scott Robinson got the chance but could not hold it in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow had just tried his way to meet Craig Halket’s head ball near the gate.
The athletes were content to let the Ringers ’ team play in front of them, knowing that they could harm the visitors with films.
This is how a crucial victory was made.
The Ringer’s team made a mistake and set up a refrigerator and the Livingstone team had a chance, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave each other a ball and found Menga, who touched the ball in the middle of the box and gained the prize.
At the same time, Ringers ’ team was the main base of the team’s soccer team, but they found that members of the team were not easy to get in and the yoke was easy for Liam Kelly.
This remained the second stage, even though Alfredo Morelos had shown a male to keep Kely’s ball in check.
Scott Pittman’s soccer was tied in with the weight of a steel band’s Ringer Allan McGregor’s team’s team’s team’s band band’s foot and Lithgow failed to win the prize on Livingstone’s team tie.
Bibings regularly fit into the Livingston box and have been removed continually, while the two peno requests were rejected after the errors of Halkett who replaced Glen Middleton, and another error concerning catching a ball.
It's strange from the Livingstone team - assimilation by another observer.
Alaska Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A good sport is the wonderful result of the Livingstone movement.
For me, they are more efficient than we might have expected.
He did not change his performance and his players from time to time won the best of all teams, but the reverence must go to the Holts in the way they have helped the team since they arrived.
He had a number of talented athletes!
The captain of Halkett played an important role in the game, encouraging his well - designed tiers, while Menga kept the Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Ringers team was not encouraged, however.
He had lost his good judgment at times when Gerard was guided by his personal fine qualities.
Their final games were not merely an opportunity to try to catch up with the door - to - door party and to be a surprise to Ringers ’ lady, which is at the center of the controversy’s history.
Erdogan is widely accepted in Cologne
There was a smile and a smile on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which is intended to repair the relationship between the NATO members.
They argued about human rights, the right of journalists, and the entry of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to establish a new department.
The city is home to the Turks.
The police mentioned security reasons when they stopped a group of 25,000 to gather in front of the district, but many of the followers came close to see their president.
Hundreds of Ardogan - many of their Kurdi - Kurdigers also made their voices clear, condemning Erdogan’s views as well as the German official view of him in the country.
The presentation of these two sections highlights the division of people's opinions in regard to a visitor that some of the German Turks view as a hero and an enemy of cruel domination over others.

Long Latin Prison: Six officers injured in a riot
Six officers have been injured by a riot in a high - security prison, the Office of the Prison.
The violence started at the HMP Long Latin in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST Sunday, and it continues.
Experts of the "Tornado" have been brought up to deal with this disorder, which includes eight prisoners and is held in one section.
The officers had been given medical treatment after being partially injured in the face.
“ Well - trained prison personnel have been sent to confront the HMP Long Actin.

HMP Long Latin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison warden had received medical treatment after being arrested by a prisoner.
And in October last year the violence officials were called into prison to deal with a serious disturbance while their employees were subjected to violent beatings.
The Rosa Storm Threat threatened to destroy Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by Flood (Deadlands Can Benefit)
It may not be possible that a storm will strike Arizona, but that is what must be done the first week of the morning when the rest of Rosa's storm force will pass through the Western Desert, giving the threat of flooding.
The world Weather management has already issued a positive look at the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in southeastern Arizona and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross the Phoenix II, and I am also approaching Monday on rain.
The director of the Phoenix World Weather had written in aet "With only ten hurricanes that still have no storm or cold winds during Phoenix’s 200 - degree turn since 1950 ”!
Katrina (1967) was a violent storm that took over 40 miles [40 km] beyond the AZ border.
The more recent photos of the International Storm Administration show an average rainfall of 2 to 4 acres [2 to 4 ha], and the rain that will fall in different places has six marks on Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Some parts of the Western Desert, including the center of Rockies and Great Basin, may be 1 to 2, with the chance of falling water in places up to 4 degrees Fahrenheit [4 ° C].
For those who are not in the danger of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the area suffers from drought.
Even when flooding is a major problem, some rain may be beneficial, since Southwest rains are encountered by drought.
According to the U.S. Dought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s area is experiencing severe drought, the second largest section, the "weather.com.
For one thing, Hurricane Rosa’s storm will trigger a fall in the Baja California area of Mexico.

The Trump said that the Kavanaugh's encounter with, abuse, anger of the Democratic Party
"Navanaugh's Democratic Party's voter's vote against atrocities," Trump did so at the convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The Trump said that the Kavanaugh was faced with the cruelty, anger, and wrath of the Democratic Party during the course of his choice.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Fourth Congress, who strongly and harshly rejected the charges made by Christine Blasey Ford that they had raped him a few years ago as a youth.
Ford too testified to his claim.
On Saturday the president said that "Americans have seen the skill and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to ensure Justice Kavanaugh and a vote to establish one of the most valid legal procedures of our time, a judge with the best reputation for human welfare," told his team of followers in West Virginia.
The president mentioned the election of Kavanaugh where he spoke of the need for a good departure for those who follow the Republican Party on moderate elections.
It is five weeks before one of the most important choices in our time will take place.
I don't run, but I'm running very fast," he said.
"This is why I am everywhere to fight for the right choice."

Hundreds have been killed by an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, with increasing numbers
A total of 384 passengers were killed, many of them being swept ashore, when a massive earthquake and tsunami occurred on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, and on Saturday, the authorities say.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, where a 40 - foot - long [6 m] wave had broken off the coast in the evening and vomited many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 strong earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat began the day, people were still doing their work on the mainland and did not leave immediately, and they were affected," Sutopo Poko Nugroho, minister of the BBC Disaster Redia conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami has not come alone, draws cars, drills, houses, and transporting everything out," Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami had passed the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survive, they said.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 locations in Pallu.
Space photo produced by the disaster organization has shown many homes and shops after damage, broken bridges and damaged by the water-mills.
Earthquakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
Several earthquakes occurred in one area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assetsment and Communication of Technology (BPT) also claimed that the energy generated by the big earthquake Friday was about 200 nuclear bombs that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the ends of a long, narrow harbor, and this has added to the spread of the tsunami, it did.
Nugroo described the destruction as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels fell.
The bodies of the victims were found to be buried under the rubble of a collapsed building, they said, adding that 540 persons were injured and 29 are unknown.
Nugroro said that the wounded could be located along the coast of a 300 km (190 m) north of Palu, a region called Dontulaa, which is close to the quake.
The means of communicating were "particularly covered and had little to do with the environment" from the Dontula, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 residents there," said the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers go to areas affected.
"This is already a problem, but it can develop," it said.
On Saturday the council was severely criticized for not knowing that a tsunami had occurred in Palulu, even though authorities said that the tides had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an uncertain video distributed on social media the father can be heard on the roof of the house shouting a warning to the people on the road that the tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later the wall of water fell onto the beach, carrying houses and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video at that time.
The quake and the tsunami had turned power out to be the most destructive force in the history of communication, making it difficult for governments to coordinate saving operations.
Soldiers have begun sending shipments of cargo and supplies from Jakarta and other cities, government officials, but survivors still need food and other necessities.
The city’s gates had been opened to promote private activity and to close up until Oct.
President Jok Oddo must go to the rescue center on Sunday.
The death toll of Tsunami in Indonesia has increased to over 800.
It’s terrible.
While the World Vision workers from Dontula have made their way to the city of Palu, where workers are living in sacks with wooden frames that have been set up in their office’s courtyard, they have reached the lost areas on their way, says Mr. Doseba.
She told me she had seen many damaged homes, she said.
It’s too expensive.
Even the relief teams began planning to provide help, some complained that foreign volunteers with more expertise were being forbidden to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, donations, and foreign workers start moving only when disaster has been declared national.
This has not been the case here.
"It's still a district disaster," said Aulia Arriani, Prophet of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"If the government says, "It is the disaster of the world," we may ask for help from other countries, but no such information has now been provided."
The second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and a tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the lost ones hoped that their loved ones would return as never before in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was picked up from the toilet.
On Sunday, the rescue team rescued a mother who had been buried in a garbage dump for two days while her mother’s body was near her.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian soccer coach, had trained two of the missing athletes in the Asian games, which were completed in Indonesia for the first time this month.
Among those imprisoned at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel were her students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a major game in parachute, I have my own anxiety," he said.
Gendon also relates how, a few hours after the message to the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the parachutes, he tried to send the Whass App messages to the Palup players, who share in the celebration on the beach.
Its messages, though, produced only one white signal, instead of two blue symbols.
I think it means that the messages have not yet arrived," he said.
Thieves $26,750 while trucking cash into a Newport and attracters at Newport
According to reports of the Newport Police Department, Friday morning thieves steal $26,750 during the time that the car will exchange cash into a lunchroom and attracters in Newport.
The drivers leave the cash registers in the entertainment room and plan to give up some money, Det. Dennis McCarty wrote in his report.

Kane West: The singer has changed his name to Himself
Kannye West is changing the name Ye.
In addition to the changes on Twutter Saturday, he wrote: "One is known as the Kane West."
West, 41 - year - old He had been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth seal, which was published in June.
This change occurs before the weekend on the Light Live, where he is expected to produce his newfound seed called Yandi.
He replaced the musician Ariana Grande on a show that resolved "because of a misunderstanding," said the shower.
In addition to being the epitome of his work, West said that the word has a religious meaning to him.

Therefore I am with you and with us, that we may die.
It came from Kanye, that is, to Him alone, only the reflection of our goods, our faults, our confusion, all of them.
It shows us who we are."

PEOPLE of Mexico swear that they do not use a military force against the common people
The leader appointed by the Mexican leader Anders Manuel Lopez Observatory has vowed that he will not use an army to fight the civilians as the nation approached 50 years of the day that many students were killed.
Lopez Obrador promised Sunday at Tlatolco Plaza that he would never use the army to oppress the Mexicans.
Soldiers shot students in the courtroom on October 2, 1968, and killed about 300 while the liberationist schools were firmly established in Latin America.
Lopez Oparador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving money each month to students and opening many private private universities.
He also said that unemployment and the lack of education are drawing young people into a gang.
U.S. government will raise the price of automated machines
While China is developing in the field of automation, the American must raise the cost of research in the field, say a businessman and a promoter of the use of such machines as Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Many U.S. government branches have announced the use of these machines, while the world has no effective program of AI.
In the meantime, China has established this policy last year: and it is expected that by 2030 it will be on Number 1 in the matter of using it.
"Composal raising may be a good start, since all countries are far behind the U.S., and we need to find jobs that are more advanced in this phenomenon," said Lee.
These supplements may double the opportunity to have success with AI in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in a discussion of this week.
Lee, according to the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, executive director of the Sinonotion Ventures company that has put a lot of money into the research of human machines in China, Face +.
In the 1980 ’ s he was at the University of Carnegie Mellon and developed a machine that was able to conquer Othelo’s actor and later became the leader of the Microsoft and director of the Google branch in China.
Lee was grateful at the start of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and wanted to know when the contest would take place again to help the scholars who follow it.
Researchers in the U.S. country often have to work hard to win government prizes, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes educated people; but it’s companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other firms have been applying university experts to work in parts of AI in recent years.
Lee said that a change in immigration policy would also help to strengthen the U.S.
"I think that people who have PhD levels in the training of the machine should be given a certificate to allow them to become American citizens.
China had established its program for development in the Machines in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China is a source of income for various schools, as does the government and other research agencies in the United States, but the education of China is not, reports Lee.
Early this year the Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve colleagues in companies and education, and White House has announced the establishment of the Secret Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA has announced $2 billion crops in a form called AI Net.
As for NSF, it still costs more than $100 million a year in an AI survey.
When the National Security Commission puts $100 million on the part of the annual human - making machines.
Macedonians have adopted a national name for the name of the country
They decided on a Sunday vote to hear if it was necessary to change the name of the country, the "R Republic of North Macedonia" which would cause the conflicts between the world and Greece that have also banned it as a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the district of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbors has thus challenged the registration of Macedonia as a member of the NATO and the EU.
In June the governments agreed to change the name of Macedonia, but cultural promoters have refused to consider the change of the name to be an insult to the culture and history of the Macedonians.
The president of the country Gjorge Ivanov says that he does not vote on the front seats and that the majority of people's votes have given the threat that the votes may be less than half the population of the country to be approved.
The question of the opinion of the council was: "Do you want to be members of the NATO and EU in accordance with our relationship with the Greek world?"
Supporters of this name, such as the Minister of the Republic of Zoran Zaev, have suggested that it is a difficult thing to do but that it should be allowed to become a member of the EU and NATO, in order to leave the former Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote for the future of our country, the future of the Macedonians to live freely as members of the European Union, because this means that all people will live without fear," said Olivera Georgjevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not in accord with the law, many legal advisers agree that they have agreed with the outcome of a decision in order to determine what is truly worthwhile.
The change of the name would require two thirds of all legal advisers.
The election committee in the country said that there were no difficulties when arriving at 1st afternoon.
However, the voters were 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the votes of the 2016 legislatures elected to vote.
"I came to vote for my children, we and the European," said Gjose Tanevski of 62 years in the country's capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, Zorica and his son, Dushko, vote in Macedonia for the country’s name to open the way for Nato and European Union to enter Strumica, Macedonia 30, 2018
In a parliamentary building in the city of Skopje, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavararkov sets up a small tower and builds chairs in front of the tents that are set up and which will pass away.
"We want to be members of NATO and EU, but we want to join these organizations with good reason, not by force, said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor, but we have respect.
If he doesn't want us to be members like Macedonia, we can enroll in other organizations such as Russia and China as the Euro-Asia.
The prime minister Zaev said that being a NATO will increase trade in Macedonia, which is also the number of people who have less work.
"I believe that many will be prejudiced because over 80 percent of our citizens like EU and NATO," said Zaev atota.
He said that the vote "ye" is "may be fixed for our future."
Kauninu which was broadcast on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research indicated that some 30 to 43 percent of the population will participate in less than - a - reasonable number of return visits.
One TV producer indicated that 57 percent of the people to whom he spoke would throw up this God - ordained lottery.
Some 70 percent of those polled said they would vote in accordance with the country’s name.
The best results include 50 percent, including one vote.
The rejection of this position was the first failure of a European government commission following the leadership of May last year.
Ornana: The Manchester City athlete, Sergio Aguero has passed the curtains behind Brighton’s team to release the prize
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed the curtains behind the Brghton team where Manchester City won 2 of the 0 Saturdays at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The Aguero had acted as easy as possible when she was burned in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean team first received a football right in the middle of the stadium.
He ran with the ball and with three rings on his back, and then I got a chance.
Aguero later met with four of Brghton’s players.
He then struck one tiers behind the back and ran faster than the others and entered into a bag box at the Brighton team.
He then handed the ball to Sterling, who was on the left.
An English athlete beat the ball once and gave it back to Aguero, whose right leg struggled to cross the Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gondola.
"Aguero is suffering from pain at her feet," Pop Guarddiola, director of the Machester City team.
"We said she was playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the opportunity to get a prize at the time.
But it was Sterling who made it a success in the cup - taking contest.
His weapon arrived at 29 minutes.
Aguero received a ball in Brighton's team.
Then she gave Leroy Sane a beautiful ball game at the left of the stadium.
Sane played the soccer several times and then handed the ball over to Serling to guide the ball in a barrel.
Sterling simply pushed the ball into a chain just before it fell to the border.
The Manchester City team plays with the Hoffenheim team in the European Campions League in a team panel at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Sinheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants the baby games and Rockies
When the Nationals team was released in the desert line, there was no need to replay other games.
However, the athlete Scherzer wants him to play Sunday with the Colorado Rockies team, except for a program to have the results of the game’s role in the Rockies, leading up to the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies team won 5-2 games at night with the Nationals team on Friday night, but they are still eager to win their first cup.
"Even there is nothing to be found on these shows, but we will go into the theater to know that the local people in Denver and the team will give us the largest game I can play in the year.
So why don't I want to play such games?
The Nationals did not announce the start of Sunday, but they are apparently thinking of the Scherzer to play the game in the first place.
Scherzer, who will have had 34 games at a time, has made plans to play a Thursday baseball game and has had enough rest on Sundays.
The Washngton player has 18-7 players in the 2.53 ERA and has played 300 footballs and 220 football fields in the two sections of this game.
Trump conventions in West Virginia
The president mentioned the election of Kavanaugh where he spoke of the need for a good departure for those who follow the Republican Party on moderate elections.
Everything we have done is under threat in November.
It is five weeks before one of the most important choices in our time will take place.
This is one of the largest, big -- I am not running but very fast for why I am everywhere in the fight for the right choice," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see a formidable, dangerous group of Democrats, you see happening here.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means are needed, seeing the difficulties, fears, and difficulties they face.
He doesn't care about who has hurt him, who must cross over to gain strength and correction, only with power and correction, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrat, said the Democrat, has the goal of "rejecting and banning."
"Then you saw this four days ago," he said, referring to the Democrats as "resent but cruel and fearful but not true."
He also named the leader of the Senate Committee, Dianne Feinstein in the Democrat, which was received with derogatory terms from the audience.
Do you recall the answer?
Did you produce it?
Ah, no.
No, I wait for that one - and was a very difficult body language - the heavy body language I have ever seen."
The camp is no longer a large congregation.
He does not let anyone know what he is thinking
When the promoters of the Momentum party in my party decided to criticize me, it was not surprising.
Besides, I am the last of the PBBor to be told that we are not welcome for all of this because of our communication.
An official of Joan Ryan’s court was also treated as an exception to religion.
To me, the examiner has condemned me for not associating with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the need for reliable financial policies, for security, in Europe, matters that Jeremy did not agree with the leaders of the past.
The knowledge of the Nottingham East Labor Friday convention was "We would like the meetings to be an emotional and beneficial to others.
For eight years like the AP of the Labor Party, the GC Friday night assemblies had been the same.
Sadly today, it's not where many meetings were held and the promise of taking political action in a "good, calm" way has already become apparent and if this is already done.
It seems also that differing views are not allowed within the Labor and Operation movement is seen as a test on which it is a formable to the part of an authority officership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as did my supposed political associates, who began to expect me to change and live in places where I did not agree with the security of the country or the security of the EU.
Every time I speak freely and it doesn't matter what I say, I follow the social media persecution that he wants me to be not selected, to criticize the local politics, to tell me not to be a member of the Labor party.
And it’s not just my experiences.
True, I know that I have a better privilege than some of my peers as points that have been presented to me are political.
I am impressed by the skills and devotion of those around me who are violent or prejudiced every day.
One of the most disturbing features of our political era is how cruel news of violence can be seen as normal.
Late Saturday Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labor Party should follow a policy of caring for others.
The truth is that we are no longer a much larger congregation and with any ‘ lack of confidence ’ or the legal adjustments of the party.
I have had a lot of technology during the past two years when I am encouraged to drop my head, keep my speech under control, and become a "good person."
But that was not the reason for my involvement in politics.
Since the surrendering of the Labor Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, when I was annoyed by the fact that I had quit my entire class in a fallen school, I have tried to encourage good works of the government to whom they needed most — such as a house servant or a civil officer.
I have never resolved my political goals, including those that I previously chose.
No one in Nottingham East could be distracted by my ideas and stories that I did not agree with this new leadership.
For all of them, I would say that when this world enters Brexit that will harm families, businesses and government activities, I do not understand my purpose to waste time and energy to be faithful to the leader of the Barour party.
But the message I have is not from Nottingham Momentum, and from the area I believe, whether it is the Campours or not: I am proud to serve you and promise you that no threat to the choice or the political system can prevent me from doing what I believe is needed by all of you.
Chris Leslie and MP of Nottingham East.
Aymar 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr’s permanent device rose to the top
The final two stars have changed the outcome of the film, but no wonder that Ayr has to win the lynnets Ligi.
Ayr is on the top, and only the group has never won in ten history.
At the end, it was a perfect match for the marionettes, and it was a good reason for the players not taking advantage of the many opportunities to do so to the teacher, Peter Murchie.
"We’ve had a difficult history but have never been defeated, so I should be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie a Melrose said: "To the Ayr team, they used their opportunities better than ours."
The 14 - minute offer that Grant Anderson obtained was used by Fazier Cli, who led the Ayr team, but the yellow card from Roy Hughes of Scotland, led by Jason Baggot.
Duri added the Ayr team’s wings through a pennote and destroyed the first section before the Ayr team was directed by 17 to 5.
However, Melrose’s team started a second phase, and the privileges that Patrick Anderson achieved were exploited by Baggot, who then beat the twins into 5.
Later, the stage was set for Ruardedh Knott, who was loaded on a cloth, the new Ayr’s art added the prizes through the Stafford McDall.
A team member of the Ayr team, Blair Macpherson, also received a yellow and discharge document, and he also took advantage of the increase in their sizes and attempted to throw the crown to Bruce Colvine, in front of the Ayor team.
The gang at the entrance also held back, and when Struan Hutchinson received his yellow ensign at Cli without a ball, on a penote line, MacPerson was shot in the Ayor team.
As a result of the success of the new team, Mr. Kyle Rowe played in the box so that Gregory Henry could win his team.

Our band: Bolivia hoping that the Court will open up the way to the Pacific
Sailors watch over the military headquarters of La Paz.
Governments raise the blue flag.
The maritime camps from the Sea of Titicaca to the Amazon have the words: "The sea is ours free.
It is our responsibility.
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coast that has disappeared in the 20th century is still well - known as the desire to walk again in the Pacific Ocean.
That prospect may have been greater for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the world court on 1 October 1, after a five - year debate.
" Bolivia has power, a cooperative and peaceful spirit, and has great hope and confidence in its results," says Roberto Calzadilla, prime minister of Bolivia.
Many of Bolivia’s people will see the ICJ decision at the major exhibitions throughout the country, believing that the Hague court will contribute to what is said to Bolivia’s long - term conversation over the years — with the idea of establishing a sea voyage for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the well - known president of Bolivia, is in the throes of a difficult new year’s election and a host of expectations for Mondays.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised toward the end of August.
However, some experts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia's choice and that little will change if it is done.
The UN from the Netherlands has no power to hand over the land of Chile, and it has been said that they do not realize the consequences of discussions.
That the ICJ will come only six months after the final case was heard shows that the case was "not difficult," said Paz Zárate, a civil specialist in Chile.
Besides promoting Bolivia’s goal, the past four years may have restored the country.
"Conventure is taken by the Bolivian authorities here," said Zárate.
Morales ’ cruel speech has spoiled the rest of Chile’s goods, he said.
Bolivia and Chile continue to converse, but how difficult it will be for them to do so later!
The two countries have been in no position to serve as overseers since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, dismissed the idea that these decisions had taken an amazing turn of action.
The writing will bring Bolivia "the best opportunity to have a new relationship with Chile" as well as the opportunity to "resolve 139 years of misunderstanding and to have a meaningful relationship," she said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales - is one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America was using maritime affairs as a political means.
" Bolivia will not leave her freedom to go to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"This decision is an opportunity to deal with the past."
North Korea says that it will not destroy nuclear weapons unless it trusts the U.S.
Foreign Minister North Korea Ring Ho said that their country would not destroy their nuclear weapons for the first time if they could not believe Washington.
It speaks of this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfill their vow to the Singaporean board of directors.
His words come after the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii seems to have been close to the start of a three - month nuclear hearing at the Singapore conference by Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
It is said that it is a ‘ dream ’ that continuing economic punishments and the U.S. refusal to declare that the war in Korea would result in the fall of North.
Washington does not want to make that proclamation before Pyonging.
Both President Donald Trump and United States wanted a second meeting.
But there is general doubt that Pyonging can be determined to give up weapons that the country views as the only safe way to protect.
Pompeii is preparing to go to Pyongyang in the morning for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal a number of recent hats on the way to High Street near you
If you want to have different hats or close to the sun, do not look anywhere else.
Valentino and Thom Browne revealed several large SS19 hats on the street that fascinated and surprised those who had certain fashions in Paris Fashion Week.
Unthinkable hats were sent to Instagram during the past summer, and these manufacturers have brought their beautiful creatures into the streets.
Valentino’s plain plain hat was a large, elegantly decorated with a feather that filled the heads of the characters.
The larger ones include such things as razors, a special hat, and yet did not make your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed the most surprising form of masks and also during the celebration of Halloween.
Many colorful masks had been torn in lips and more like Hannibal Lectter than the hauture.
One creature is like an instrument of water filled with tubes and glass, while another looks like a calculus.
And if you keep talking about these fashions, you have a chance.
The fashion management predicts that large binoculars can go to the main streets near you.
The large hats are clearly visible along with La Bombay, a two - leged grass hat that has been visible to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A religious sign behind an irrational hat that spread over the social media sent a large creature to a beach market made of about a large grass - sized beach.
The blue bag, a palm tree, and a white leather cap, was an attractive sight on Jacques’s La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous style writer Luke Artimitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope to see the big hats and bags of the sea reach the upper road in the early summer - as a designer may be more sensitive to the need for large products.'
John Edward: The ability to speak different languages is needed for all peoples of the world
The so - called independent schools in Scotland have a well - established academic record, and these have gone on in 2018 and other good results — all encouraged in sports, art, music, and so forth.
With some 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), endeavor to provide better care for their children and parents.
Such institutions work hard to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career, and their place of residence as citizens around the world.
As a field of education that can make up and set up a formal school education, we see modern languages continuing as the most desirable subjects in the schools.
Nelson Mandela observed: "When you speak with my father in his native language, the language, at his head is easy to understand.
If you talk to her in her language that touches her heart."
This serves as a stark reminder that we cannot rely on the English language if we want to develop a close relationship with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's tests, we can see that languages are being learned by many people and are highly successful in private schools.
About 68 percent of the students who had learned foreign languages did well and reaped outstanding results from the class A.
Most of these, gathered in 74 SCIS schools, indicated that 72 percent of the students were able to achieve high grades of the Mandarin class, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French, and 63 percent of Spanish students have also obtained the results A.
This seems to indicate that Scotland’s private schools are contributing to the study of foreign languages as the necessary skills for children and young people will no doubt want in the future.
Languages now, as a subject of choice, are being dealt with in the form of STEM (science, technology, and mathematics) in private and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons that their employers had struggled to find workers, 17 percent said they were missing people with language skills.
Language - speaking skills, therefore, are vital to prepare youths for future responsibilities.
Since many jobs are open to them with the ability to speak languages, these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of what employment a person chooses, if he learns the second language, he will have a higher chance of attaining such a long life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other lands gives a person many different languages and cultures a higher standard of living.
According to the UK report of You Gov’s 4,000 adult population in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak foreign languages in order to communicate well, and in French only 2 percent, 15 percent.
That is why spending money on a language - education program is now necessary for today’s children.
Having several languages, especially those of developing lands, will provide children with an excellent opportunity to find jobs.
In Scotland each school has its own language.
Several schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages that seem to be important to the UK in preparation for the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
No matter what your child is interested, there will always be a number of languages you can choose in private schools to teach experts in these fields.
National Schools in Scottish are devoted to developing learning methods that can prepare children and give them skills that may be needed for success, even for any future possibilities.
It will not be divided now, in the global business, that languages continue to be important in the future of the world, so this must be seen in education.
Of course, modern languages must be considered as ‘ international communications techniques. ’
Social schools continue to offer short - term, high - quality and well - quality education to the children of Scotland.
Ilkat bien in freedom.

The first appearance of LeBron at Lakes Sunday team in San Diego
Waiting is near the end of the raves waiting to see LeBron James starting to play at Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers ’ teacher Luke Walton announces that James will play them on the first Sunday games in opposition to Denver Nuggetts in San Diego.
But how much time was involved?
"There are more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakes Web site.
Lakers Mike Trudel wrote that James may be able to play for a few minutes.
Following an early week’s exercise program, James was asked what he would like to do about the six games for the Lakers team.
"I don't want a game to be ready at this time," he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia Virginia, You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump has opened the night’s heartwarming meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is one of the five options for Trump for morning’s Sunday morning, including standing meetings as in the area of Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the election of a man appointed to be a judge in Supreme Court has been terminated, Trump wants to summon the people to the middle of his reign when his party of the Republican party is threatened with the loss of power in the federal court at November elections.
What is the occasion, and how might you use the Internet?
The Trump meeting is held at 7: 00 p.m., Saturday evening, September 29, 2018.
You can also visit our website, jw.org, and the Web site offers suggestions for improving the quality of your work.
Trump should address the decision of the Brett Kavanaugh who were appointed to be judge at the Supreme Court, which provoked anger because it involves that the Kavanaughs are thought to be arrested when the vote for his conviction is now stopped by the FBI.
The main purpose of these special conventions, however, is to help the Republican group to have a share in providing hospitality in November.
Thus, the objective of the five Trump meetings is "to encourage our followers and others who want the best when the Republican party seeks to protect and increase the number of counselors in the parliament," according to Reuters news reports.
"Compose of counsel is an important factor that has caused the presidents to hold many of these conventions as we go to the time of public meetings," one of the leading organizers to choose the unrequested Trump.
The convention at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling can invite followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be broadcast by Pittsburgh, ” according to the West Virginia Metro newspaper.
The weekend will be the second time of the last month of Trump on the outskirts of Virginia, the city that he won with 40 percent votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a representative of the Republican group in West Virginia and Patrick Morrisey who still remain on the cattle.
"Helping the goats and presidents does not give a good picture to Morrisey," said Simon Hader, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters reports.
Record of Ryder’s 2018 C.E. cup: The USA team has won award in its performance as Sunday games draw to a close
After a three - time drama, Saturday’s four - person drama could have become an act that would suit Ryder’s cup.
Changes in standards of behavior are made to appear to be just as dramatic, but they are basically the same as those in a game.
Who, then, are in a position to do so?
"They led 6 percent, but now there are only 4, so we use this as an opportunity," said Jordan Spieth when they walk slowly.
A team in Europe has a 4 - percent chance of moving on board.
The American team, as Spieth says, finds that they have much to offer, such as the success of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and they all received three percent.
He has been a good man and has been good example.
As he and Thomas remained at the top of the noise was heard how the football was hit into the hole, so that history can compare four to four points.
His throwing the ball into the hole over the 15th, and people shouted the same thing, indicating that he believed that the American team had not fully won.
"One just has to wear the bridge and think about your toys," said Spieth.
This is what all players have here.
Only 18 other members of the team have shown off.
The players who are more championed than Spieth and Thomas in those two days are Frascesco Milinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are still lost in the Ryder cup.
The most popular two European athletes are 4 percent and are sinless.
"Moliwood" was the lone player who did not catch a ball near the valley on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last 9 channels.
This, as well as their own encouragement and encouragement to the press, shows that they are the most difficult players to win on Sunday, and no other players in Europe can win the winning team than Fleetwood or Molinari after the sun set in Le Gof National.
They may have differing channels, so to speak.
It is still easy to say that a European team has taken a cup, so far.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated Sergio Garcia, who was a team with Alex Noren at four football games in the morning.
Their team was led by the Spanish and Seeden, who refused to return.
But on Sunday there is no limit to his success.
Four football games and four players are so happy to see a close - up view as a result of the two - team discussion, the instruction provided, the guidance not to be given, and the way the game can change.
A team in Europe is currently running a team and is on their way to a final show, but the four show showed that the American team has the highest potential, particularly those in the United States.
The European team leads 10-6 percent on the last day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will have the privilege of playing the final game in the Ryder cup after winning the American team on four Saturdays with 10-6 seconds.
Two inspired men, Tommy Fletwood and Francesco Molinari, led a sports team that suffered much at the hands of Tiger Woods, their successes at the Le Golf National stadium resulted in up to four prizes.
A European team trained by Thomas Bjorn, who had refused to take a cup two years ago from Hazeline, placed the American team on a four - morning soccer team in a range of 31 games.
The American team of soccer competed with the other two players in winning two games, but this did not prevent win.
Jim Furryk’s class requires 8 percent of each 12 - week game to win a cup.
Fleetwood is the first European athlete to win four constituents in the game and through their good late Saturdays, he and Molinari, who like their favorites, say "Milliwood" and two players two more than four players in the first four games in Ryder's history.
Having successfully won Woods and Patrick Reed in the four soccer games, he also won the first complete victory for the American soccer team.
Woods, who tried to get off on two Saturdays, showed a bracing once and again but still won 19 sets of four players and four characters in a series of seven games.
Justin Rose took a four - wheel - drive stand, then a two - man team with Henrik Stenson on a four - man show, and won two - and - a - half - minute Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -o, who were the first in the world.
On a cold winter day just south of Paris, the European team did not cross the street.
The three - time winner of the winning team, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas, led the American team on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 percent over the Jon-Rahm and Ian Powerter of the Spanish team in four football competitions and also the Poulter and the Royal Mcllroy 4 and 3 in the four games even won their first two games.
In the history of Ryder’s cup alone, only two times the remainder of a team and four percent of the team in a single game have won, even though the Furryk team that protects the cup has to compare its strength with that of the other team to pick up the cup.
After a second team completes a day’s activities, a full - scale Sunday can seem more challenging.
North Korea has said that there is no reason for her to give up her weapons without any confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign government official told the United Nations that continued quarantine would increase their distrust of the American government and that there was no reason for his country to stop using nuclear weapons alone during that period.
Ri Yong Ho spoke to the UN Annual Assembly that North Korea had done things like "construction" during the past year, such as stopping their nuclear weapons and explosives, destroying the nuclear plant and promising that they would not resuscitating their nuclear weapons.
"But we haven't seen the United States do the same things again," he said.
"Unbelieved in the United States we will not be content with the security of our country and in these things it is unlikely that we will begin to give up nuclear weapons alone."
Even Ri repeats a North Korean complaint about refusing to give up the nuclear weapons of the United States where North Korea was to be praised for its major success in this regard, his words were very effective because the country did not just have to refuse to give up the nuclear use of Pyingng in the past.
I referred to a message written by Kim Jong Un and Trump on the first location of the presidents of the United States and North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try "stop the nuclear weapon in Korea" and the Trump stressed safety in North korea.
North Korea had been seeking the end of the war between North Korea and South Korea, but North Korea had entered the nuclear age.
The United States has been unable to reduce North Korea’s severe punishments.
"America is holding fast "the first time to give up nuclear weapons" and has been adding to North Korea's last few measures to threaten North Korea, and America has been refusing again "proclaiming the end of war," said R.
"The idea that punishments can force us is just a dream of people we don't know well.
But the problem is that it will come up with our discontent.
He had not mentioned Kim and Trump, the second president of the United States, who was present at the United Nations General Assembly at the beginning of this week.
Instead, the officer spoke of the Kim and South Korea president of Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If the matter of disarmament was between us and South Korea and not America, it would not have come to such an extent of misunderstanding."
Even so, Ri's language was different from that of the previous year in a U.N. speech when he told them that to direct the Americas with the weapons of North Korea was easy when the "Wicked President" Trump called Kim "expert" on an empty seat.
This year at the United Nations conference, the Trump, who last year threatened to ‘ totally ruin ’ North Korea, praised the Kims ’ for the first time in the campaign against the use of nuclear weapons, but said that much work had to be done and that North Korea’s penal system was still under way.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have time limit, and said "Whether it takes two years, three or five years to be without work."
China and Russia appealed to the UN Security Committee to recognize North Korea’s policies.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii told the Fourth General Security Committee of the Council: "Courtages from the National Security Committee to North Korea were to continue and are inevitable until we can see that the world has completely stopped its use of weapons."
The committee has been extending North Korea’s national policy since 2006 in an effort to prevent the banking of North Korea for nuclear and other missiles.
Wampeo met Ri at the close of the UN Assembly and offered to travel to North Korea the following month to organize the second Trump with Kim.
Pompeii has moved to Norht Korea three times this year, but the final leg of the trip is not successful.
They left North Korea saying that the discussions worked well, but a few hours later the North Korean country argued against him, saying that he was offering a "profession'.
North Korea has promised to meet the Moon this month to destroy the nuclear plant and the U.S. arsenal if the United States would do the same.
He said that Kim had told them that her ‘ similar' needs are the guarantee of the Singapore Security promised and the ways to establish the relationship with the United States.
Harvard University is a study in which students learn to get sufficient sleep
This new study at Harvard University, which began this year, has made it possible for college students to get sufficient sleep in order to end the study all nightly with an anti - sleeping medication.
One scholar noted that high school students worldwide are self - sufficient.
Charles Czeisler, professor of physiology at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist in Brigham Hospitals and Mother’s has established a study that is considered to be the first in American history.
He encouraged the study program after he finished teaching about the consequences of practicing self - denial.
One girl found me and said: ‘ Why am I told this in my last year?'
She said no one told me the importance of sleep - which surprised me, she told the Telegraph.
This year’s first study teaches students the importance of getting a good night’s sleep, as well as of making sure that there is a good night’s rest.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Head of the Institute of Health, said that the university decided to start a study after learning that most students do not sleep during the week.
This one - hour presentation presents itself with a wide variety of conversations.
In one section there is a picture of a hotel room, where students have a cup of coffee, cards, teachers, and books to tell about the dangers of sleeping and light, and how to be well - fed in sports, and the need for proper sleep.
In another field, students are told that lack of sleep increases the risk of heart disease, depression of cancer.
The school’s informative maps are a warning to the students about their day - to - day activities.
We know that it does not change the behavior of the students there.
But we believe that they have the right to know where you have the right to know about the dangers of smoking, says Professor Czeisler.
The pride 'and study all night long, he said, added that new skills and lack of education add to the students' sleeplessness.
To make sure that you get enough sleep, as well as the best way for students to be a ‘ secret weapon to cope with frustration, fatigue, and anxiety, he must also avoid obesity, for lack of sleep makes the brain hungry more frequently.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California medical students helped Professor Czeisler prepare the study as he learned one of the lessons of this professor in his first year at Harvard University.
He said that the study opened his eyes and urged him to encourage the professors to take the course of each of the university courses.
As a result, he needs all the college students to have the same education.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a time limit for their sleep, as well as a proper time to get up, and learn about the dangers of light coming from a telephone, a microphone, and a light fixture that reduces sleep loss.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranges: The Menga’s hero caused Gerard team to surrender
The Ringers ’ team also gave way to the movement of Dolly Menga’s victory caused Gerard, seemingly imprecise, to fall to 1-0 in front of Livingstone’s team.
The Bibrox team appears to have won the first march since February when it won 41 spies in front of the St Johnstone team, but the class trained by Gary Holt defeated the Gerard team to give Gerard a second turn in 18 games since teaching the ball, resulting in eight units on the top of Hearts.
Menga burned it just seven minutes before the first section, and the support team of Ringers was not seen and was able to recover.
When Ringers ’ team falls on the historical list of six to six minutes, the Livingstone team has risen to the third and is behind the Hebronn.
There may also be other difficulties that have occurred to the Ringers when a helper to the Camlum Spence was helped by a doll from head injuries accompanied by an object thought to have been dropped from the latter side.
Gerard turned eight athletes who defeated Ayr’s team to arrive at Betfred’s cup.
When Holt did not change the role of athletes who competed with the Hearts team last week and must have been happy with the support of his team in Ringers ’ team.
The Ringers ’ team was the main park, but the Livingstone team was responsible for the burning and burning of the soccer team.
In fact, he had to turn it in the first two minutes when Menga gave a fine ball to Scott Pittman to blow on the bar and Allan McGregor, but the contestants fought his ball right side.
He was caught by Keshon Jacobs on a sport he played with Craig Halket, and Alan Lithgow, a tier with Craig Halket.
Ringers ’ team showed up but apparently gave up hope but did not trust, especially when they arrived at the store.
Alfredo Morelos suspects that he must be given a 15 - minute oral copy when he met with Steven Lawles but the performers, Thomson accepted a Colombian athlete.
The Ringer’s team was able to win only two rounds, but the ancient Ringer’s team, Liam Kelly, had no problem with soccer from Lasssana Coubally and Ovie Ejaria.
When a 34 - minute project of Livingstone’s team was achieved against the performance of the games, no one would deny that the tiger had to obtain a catch.
Ringers ’ team also refused to remove the ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not save the ball when Declan Gallagher gave a ball to Scott Robinson who calmly played and gave it to Menga who easily destroyed.
Gerard showed his dissatisfaction with Ringers ’ team when he took out Coubal and introduced Ryan Kent and was able to produce good fruit with urgency when the players gave it to Morelos, but Kelly, who played it out.
But Livingston’s team forced Ringers ’ team to play their favorite soccer team, and Lithgow and Halket put the ball away.
The Holt team could have added his arrows at the end of the game, but McGregor carefully bandaged Jacobs, Lithgow, before hitting the ball at the other end of the game.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, who came out from the outside, cried for another note against Jacobs, but Thomson, the performers, also refused the offer.
Almanac: Geiger Counterman
And now a page from the "Sanday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, the past 136 years, and SUGYA... the day that the future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of identifying and testing the force released in the design of the atom, which eventually made it the Geiger Counter.
If the main tool of science since then, the Geiger County has become a well - known tool, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado, ” how Roy Rogers and Dale Evans seem to be the most unreliable scientists:
Brother: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Counterer’s instrument, which is used for generating electricity, such as uranium.
When you have these devices on your head, you can feel the effects of the impact of atoms.
Evans: "True, this is amazing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the products are still there.
A new vaccine for cancer may help to help protect the immune system 'to detect dangerous cells.
This new vaccine for cancer may help to protect the body’s immune system 'to detect and kill dangerous cells
A vaccine has helped the immune system to identify dangerous cells as one of the means to treat the disease.
This procedure involves releasing the body cells from the patient, converting them into a laboratory
Then they can see the proteins that are found with more cancer and then they can be treated with insulin.
A simple vaccine offers hope for the treatment of various cancers.
One woman helped by this vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect dangerous cells, had seen her prostate cancer going on for 18 months.
This process involves releasing the body cells from the patient, adjusting them into a laboratory so that they can "see ” a common cancer protein called heR2, and reemerge the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show we have a vaccine to help us."
HER2 "compliances with several types of cancers, "including breast, cervical, lung and colon cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
This same method of decomposing cells from patients and ‘ teaching ’ how to handle cancers is also used in treating a type of blood cancer.
When they appeared at SNL, the West launched a Trump, wearing a hat inscribed with the U.S.
It’s Never Too Late
Well, West was criticized in a drama on Saturday Light Live after playing a game that was lauded by the U.S. President and said Donald Trump will win the 2020 votes.
After his third song, Ghost Town that night, in which he wore a hat written on the Democrat, he spoke harshly to the Democrat sect and repeated that he helped Trump.
"How do you like Trumps, and prejudiceds?"
So if I had been concerned about prejudice, I would have left America long ago, he said.
SNL started the exhibition with Matt Damon and then by Hollywood’s actor challenged the testimony of the Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate’s Committee on the subject of Christine Blasey Ford of rape.
Although not reported, West’s comments were sent to a social network by comicist Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock tries to ridicule the West and what he has lost on the Internet.
On the other hand, West complained to the audience that he had suffered a lot because of his hat behind the screen.
"He beat me at the back of the site.
He said, 'Aboard is the hat.'
They made me feel like one of them!
Then it is said that I am in a losing position," according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: "Do you want to see a lost place?" saying "He will wear my hero's hat, because it means that you won't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to improve?
Strive to show love.
His remarks were twice mocked by the audience and the SNL members seem to be embarrassed, Variety wrote this, and one person there says: "The whole suit was still quiet."
West had been replaced by the musician Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West is a little surprised when he sings I Lovean, dressed like the Perrier Bay.
West had been assisted by the chief TUPSA, Candice Turner who wrote on Tweeter: "For one of the most courageouss: ABOVEY BETWEOLOGY OF THE MANAGEMENT.."
But interviewer Karen Hunter sent a message to Twutter that West was "just as it is and very interesting."
"But I did not choose to give any prize (to buy music or clothing or to help her "ability") that I believe they accept and bring dangerous ideas into our area.
They are free.
If we did too, he said again.

A movie actor of Trone Kit Hartton has been annoyed by frightening views about masculinity
Kitt Hartton, known for being a boxing champion, is known as Jon Snow in the HBO drama of Threenes.
But the actress, a 31 - year - old, was against the idea of being a hero, saying that such responsibilities mean that young boys often feel that they have to be mature enough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture newspaper, Kit said he believed that ‘ something is wrong' and asked about ways to deal with dangerous male feelings during the #Me Too period.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, 31 years old and also played a game of the Game of Troys.
‘ On my own, I'm wondering in the meantime — where did we go away to do it?,' he said.
What do we teach men as they grow up, especially in the problem we see here?
Kit believes that a movie critic may be one factor contributing to this behavior, but we are grateful for the fine conduct of some of his male supporters.
He went on to say: ‘ What are humans born, and what are they taught?
What lessons are taught in the movies, and in the areas that make young men feel that they must be men?
How do we know that the answer to one of these important questions is yes?
Because it appears that something is wrong with boys.
During the conversation he also admitted that he would not have played any game of the Game of Thorns when the game ran towards the end of the morning drama, he said, ‘ they have won the battle and the donkey'.
Since November Kit has taken part in the creation of the True West drama, photographed by Sam Shepard and his brother a burglar’s brother.
He said that he felt that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing he had ever found in the Drama of Threenes.
‘ I met my wife on film, so I found my old family and my whole life from here,' he said.
Rose was Ygrette, who had been in love with Jon Snow, in a drama that also won a medal in Emmy race.
They were married in June 2018 at the university of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China is declaring an increase of 14 percent
The world has declared that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
An estimated 820,000 people in the country have the virus, health.
The combined attendance of 40,000 reached the second half of the year 2018 alone.
Many of these people contracted the virus through sexual intercourse that brought about changes.
The HIV virus is initially spread widely in some areas by means of blood transmission.
However, the number of HIV infections has been drastically reduced, said Chinese health workers at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Each year, the number of people infected with HIV increases by 100,000.
Sectation of the Hiv through sexual acts has increased dramatically in the relations of homosexuals and homosexuals.
The laws against homosexual relations in China were repealed in 1997, but the choice of these friends has increased in the country.
In view of the country’s cultural objections, surveys have found that about 70 to 90 percent of men who engage in homosexual relations eventually marry women.
The greater spread of the virus in these relationships is the direct result of unprotected sexual activity.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to treat the HIV virus to anyone in an effort to combat it.
A Maxine Waters denied that the employee was the one who had published a message about the Republican law counsel, and he said that these were "a lie of sacrilege."
American ambassador Maxine Waters objected to reports that workers at his office had published a secret message for the three experts in the Republican section of the counseling Web site.
The Democrat Waters of Los Angeles says that the article is published by the "men and pages" of the Internet intended to damage the reputation of the public.
"This is a blatant lie, a gross lie," Waters said in the message on T Titter.
The release included the addresses and phone numbers of American counselors Sensey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Dutch, Utah.
This message was found on Capitol Hill’s Web site on Thursday page after the arrest of an unknown person at the time of the decision by Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to appear before the Supreme Court.
The message was released when the three counselors asked Kavanaugh.
The websites of the Conservative Group such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedSTate also stated that the IP address that identifies the source of the site was connected with Waters office" and published more information about an Waters worker, commented Hill.
"This empty story is a complete lie," the Waters said.
"Workers at my office who has been named and its secret message and security have been placed on the rhino because of the mystery-method that he did not produce the message.
This worthless news is a complete lie."
Waters have been criticized by a number of people on the Internet, including the former White House Secretary - General Ari Fleischer.
"Rejecting this indicates anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he does not have the potential to be a Law Speaker.
If someone has been lied to one thing, there is no need to be consumed with anger.
Let him not become a blasphemer.
Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seems to have discussed the Waters speech as well as the criticism of the judges of the Kavanaugh and Democrat, who were accused of answering questions out of anger at the fourth trial.
Omar Navarro, a representative of the Republican group who was seeking to excommunicate Waters at the center of the empire, also spoke at T Titter.
"The big issue, if true," he wrote on Twutter.
In his speech, Waters said that his office announced the matter to the ‘ competent authorities ’ and the police.
"Let's make sure that the people who publish these things are known," she continued "and they are judged according to the rules in the late days because they are dangerous and disturbing to everyone in my office."
Covering the Josephine Strickes Again - Atkinson’s unmanned Atkinson’s Lottery
It is now common to touch the value of the British Development in the European documentary in Britain, and it also occurs in the events of Jonny English - English film that began in 2003 with the Jonny English film and returned in 2011 with the back of the Jonny English Reborn film.
Does speaking in a manner that is not rude in this case reflect the negative effects of the world’s big business?
At any rate, Johnny English with large and senseless eyes had a second chance — that he was able to make a full - scale English - speaking film.
He is a typical stranger who pretends to be a police detective, such as Bean, and a British statesman, such as the Charts of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The story comes from Atkinson’s previous commercial film at Barclay’s documentary, which caused a big deal.
The program features a heartwarming new feature of Johnny’s movie release.
I liked Johnny English when he went out in the plane with his old caps and knives hanging on his shoulder.
Atkinson's ability to play is evident, but his sense of humor is not so profound as it is "twicely" because the 007 films and Mission Impossible have a good sense of humor.
His sense of humor seems to have been made of children rather than adults, and to me Johnny’s visits are less artistic and more stable than Atkinson’s silent movies and were like Bean.
The opening of this article shows that Britain is in serious trouble.
Some computer operators entered Britain’s computer screens to keep track of British military personnel in various places, thus interfering with a soldier in another area - a small part of Kevin Eldon's game.
It is the last thing for the most self-willed and struggling prime minister who sees the problems of his political lack of success: Emma Thompson is burning on the part he took on the stage like Teresa May but there is no added in the drama.
His wise counselors tell him that because each employee has been distracted, he should get out of his job.
And this means Johnny English, the principal of a high school, who teaches about the effectiveness of a secret soldier: the popes have good things, while the English teaches different children to play.
English has been suddenly taken to Whitehal for a convention and has met a longtime colleague, Bough, who was also taken by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, married to a naval officer, part of a bravado referred to by Vicki Perperdine.
Thus Batman and Robin, military commanders of the great King, have also taken advantage of the encounter with Olga Kurylenko’s daughter, Ophelia Bulletova.
Today, the prime minister is frustrated by the efforts of a wealthy sponsor who is said to solve the problems of a British computer: Jason Volta, taken by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their work: falsely claiming to be food suppliers, they set fire to the French dining room; this led to the arrival of the Volta train; and English caused confusion when they wanted to use the sound system to see what was inside the Volta house.
All last things are happening in the final section, but the way it is interesting and appealing, shows that it is a video for children in all parts.
A little exciting thing.
As was the case with other up - to - date films of Johnny English, I couldn’t think of it: Would not moviemakers in Britain play the role of Rowan Atikson to study his skill?
The Labor Organization denies that it makes provision for the British to work four days a week and earn only five days ’ wages
The Jeremy Corbyn movement has had a big impression that the British are working four days on the Sabbath but are paid five days.
The company is said to want the companies to share some of the profits they have received from the company for a vacation.
The physician will give workers three days ’ rest but will receive the same pay.
According to the findings, this idea can be ‘ tied up ’ with the political ideas of the party and ideas of a successful secular society.
A four - day shift of work a week was approved by the Labor Department as a way for the benefit of the workers to benefit from the progress of the occult.
An official of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ The renewal of this system is expected to be announced within a year.
‘ It can't be possible for a single day but the working day of four days a week is well suited to the community's policies so that workers can benefit from the economic development and development of new businesses.'
The Labor Party is not the first to confirm this view, while the Green Party promised four days of work on the Sabbath during election of 2017.
However, these are not the sentiments of all members of the Labor Party.
A spokesman for the Labor Group said: 'The four-day Sabbath is not social, and it is not considered by this party.'
Shadow Chancellor of John McDonnell used the opportunity for the Service Party for a week to offer his ideas on how people can benefit from the world’s resources.
McDonnell is determined to reactivate power from the ‘ hopeless reformors ’ and 'profits' of the services.
This leader's intentions also mean that those sharing in the water companies will not return all their money as the Labor government can make up 'requesting some of the money for reasons they feel are wrong.
He also established a plan to register 10 percent of the labor force, resulting in the annual average income of £500.
A Lindsey Graham, by John Kennedy on the "60 Minutes" if a FBI survey on Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI investigation at the alleged trial by Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his election to the Supreme Court by about a week, bringing the question again that if the research is to be done, it must alter any of the tests in the Republic to prevent him from helping him.
During a Sunday - Sunday discussion, journalist Scott Pelley asked the satellites of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could cause them to change their views.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his South Carolina friend.
"To be honest, that's true," said Kennedy.
"When I go to hear the case, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, his words came out, saying, ‘ Did you do this?'
She was courageous, determined, uncompromising.
Graham’s dream, however, seems to have failed.
"My opinion regarding Brett Kavanaugh is consistent and I have to change unless there is a serious case," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what has happened, but I know only this: Brett strongly rejected them, "Graham had suggested, of Christine Blasey Ford.
" And anyone who calls him cannot be sure of this.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything that can change now."
What is the International Festival of Music, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York, the festival will be held each year, and various musicians will sing to the ends of the world.
This year the seven-year festival will be attended by thousands of people who will go to the Central Park park so that they will not only be entertained by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Menes but will be the most widely distributed of the event’s real purpose that will end poverty by the year 2030.
The observance of the International Musicians, which began in 2012 is part of the Global Poverty Project, which is fighting the world’s poverty - stricken population against poverty.
In order to receive a ticket to the party (only if it is to buy a ticket for a respected person), the casual audience may have to do a variety of jobs or activities, send an e-mail to the president of the country, contact the telephone, or any other intelligent device that may help to spread the goal of the poor.
How many years before the Festival of Booths had taken place in order to accomplish their purpose?
Is the opportunity to see musicians free of charge a convenient way to get people to action or to fight over the Internet to see if they are doing something superior by posting on the Internet or sending a message on Titata?
Since 2011, 19 million goals have been achieved by pilots.
They claim that these measures have helped to convince world leaders to establish and organize $37 billion (U.S.) to benefit 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group mentioned 390 adjustments from their experiences — about $10 billion or more.
You see, the money has been able to change the lives of 649 million people on earth.
Among other things, the UK health plan, which works as a "Helping children to grow up to their standard level," promises to help Rwanda with $33 million reverses from childhood abuse, what was done after the organization received 4700 messages from Twitta.
"With the help of the UK government, human interests, governments, and people like you, we can stop attracting" one of the health promoters, Tracey Ullman, told the London orchestra in April 2018.
More than 5,000 talks were given an incentive for the UK government to improve the health of both mother and children, and the government announced a financial relief program that would benefit the mother and her children of five million children.
In answer to the question he received on their e - mail asking, "Who is asking you for the solution to poverty?"
The group replied: "It has been a difficult and time-distant battle, and we will sometimes become weak and will fail.
Yet, like so many liberation movements back then, we are able to achieve our goals because in unity there is power.
Janet Jackson, the Weekknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and some of the musicians who would play in New York City's party, which would be conducted by Deborra-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. nation can use military forces to send off Russia to power - General Zaman
The United States "if appropriate" uses its Alkats to release precious stones and power from Russia to sell international goods, including Asian countries, the government of the US Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner report.
Zinki said that the activities of Russia in Syria, where the country is active, were invited by the official government of that country and were a means of obtaining a precious gem and power.
"I believe that the Russian government has sent its people to Asia to find a market of power such as the European," he said.
In fact, he added that there are ways to cope.
"America has such a potential, using our Sea troops, we can open the gates and, if necessary, keep their power from reaching the market, he said.
Zince says that this is in the position of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself the ‘ mouth of the users ’ in the United States.
He said that Washington’s struggle with Russia was the same as it did with Iran, saying that his goal would be one.
The "Russian and Iran economy method, however, is the same as, raising and changing oil," he said to compare Russia to the "meal."
This has come when the Trump government is in the oil industry in Europe, replacing Russia with the cheapest of its oil.
At this, leaders of Trump’s government, including the president of the country Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream II policy that dealt with Russia, said Trump that this policy had made Germany a ‘ slave ’ of the Russian world.
Russia has been insisting that a $11 - billion - dollar North Stream system, which should increase its productivity to a level of 110 million square feet [110 sq m] in length and at a very near - average economic level, has been estimated to be only a fraction of a million dollars.
The Russian nation has long been claiming that the American system is antiquated with the economy and that hatred for it is an example of oppression in the business world.
"I believe we agree that the trade of power cannot be a threat to others and that power users should have the opportunity to choose to sell the power," said American Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the U.S. Supreme Authority, Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American occupation was not happy, and Germany is fighting against it.
The Federal Trade Center of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has requested that the United States not join the European Union in terms of the power and cooperation of the states of Germany and Russia.
"I am deeply upset when a country gets involved in our power purchase," Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI, said after the joint of the German president Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will consider "Movable" Parts of the President’s Retracts in 2020, The Applied Massachusettsist Explains It
On Saturday the advisor Elizabeth Warren said she would think of a "underinstance" participating in the president's votes after the middle election.
At the convention at Hokula, Massachusetts, Warren was convinced that he would decide to participate.
Warren answered that it was time for my mother to go to Washington to repair our broken state, and this included a high mother, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, you want to "think seriously" the matter of going to the president's election."
Warren had answered regarding President Donald Trump at the convention, saying that he is ‘ taking the area to the wrong side.
"I’m concerned to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren was at the forefront in rebuking Trump and Brett Kavanaugh who were appointed to the Supreme Court.
During the January Friday, Warren said, "We really need an FBI investigation before we take a vote."
The fourth mission, published on Thursday, revealed that most of those in Warren's area do not think it proper to have them to make decisions in 2020.
Ninety - eight percent of the votes in the Massachusetts community are not to participate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent agreed with the issue of participation.
The survey shows that most people agree that the former governor of Daval Patrick must take part, while 38 percent contribute to the possibility and 48 percent oppose.
Some well - known figures of Democracy that were considered to be part of the 2020 ’ s were Prime Minister Joe Biden and Sermont of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make the right choice when he arrived in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Kulin refers to PTSD’s problem with Tack Kunin at Donald Trump
Track Kunin, aged 26, had been in Iraq for one year after writing on Sep.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son had experienced, what he had experienced on his return, I can understand some families who have been affected by PTSD and some of our soldiers' experiences," told the audience at the Donald Trump conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tenin said that his arrest was "a serious matter which no one wants to mention" and concerning their son and other fighters, "they have returned a little change, they are back strong, they are wondering if there is respect for what the soldiers are doing to the soldiers and the staff, as well as for any other member of the army, they have contributed to this country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of being a victim of torture, perverting a domestic - violence report, and possession of a weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a Prophet at the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 communities and D.C.E. are in conflict with a new law concerning the protection of refugees
Eighteen states as well as the District of Columbia are rejecting a new U.S. law that prohibits and helps refugees to escape terrorism and domestic violence.
lawyers from 18 regions and regions on Friday presented a case in the Washington Court to assist a refugee who is in opposition to the law, according to the NBC News report.
The name of the defendant in the Grace v court, which the American Civil Liberty Union announced in the month of the Ogasit against the civil policy, was not revealed.
She also said that her husband was “but a group of violent children, ” she would torture her, but the U.S. officials refused her request to flee home July 20.
They were guarded in Texas.
Grace’s assistant attorneys described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which bring in a number of U.S. shelters, such as countries that experience much of the trouble caused by violent and domestic violence.
The U.S. new U.S. law on the prevention of refugees has reversed the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals, which allows immigrants to run away from domestic violence to seek protection.
The Chief Justice of Columbia's District of Karl Racine said on Friday in their statement, "This disregards the law of decades of states, governments, and of all countries."
"This decree requires all complaints of refugees because of threats to the truth as well as the situation, and such prohibitions violate this law," the lawyers said.
The lawyers also summed up the fact that this law against foreign entry could ruin the U.S. economy, claiming that these visitors could become traders and "be necessary laborers."
In June, Justice Jeff Series ordered judges handling immigration cases that they would no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Insecurity is provided for those who have left their homes because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national, or political causes, the Court has declared the law on June 11.
Providing protection did not mean solving every sort of problem or suffering that afflicts people worldwide every day.
Relief works are being done in Palulu to provide survivors with repeated death tolls
For survivors, things are getting worse.
"It's very difficult," said 35 - year - old Rissa Toma, comforting her son with malaria at the saveover in the devastated state of Pallu.
"Every time an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is not easily available.
People seem to return to their damaged homes, carrying their possessions through flooding, trying to save whatever they can.
Hundreds of injured people and hospitals, ruined by a 7.5 earthquake, were unable to cope.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back with a shoulder, had rested outside the Palulu Hospital, where patients were assisted outside because of other severe earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes when he described the great earthquake that rocked the fifth hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
He beat me in the wall ruins, and I thought to say, "Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was the brother to have a wedding ceremony.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and it was silent.
I don’t know what has happened to her and my son.
I believe they're OK."
The United States has said that China is producing ‘ commercial ’ ads.
A week later, after placing a four - page business report in an American U.S. newspaper that criticized the American trade union between the United States and China, a representative of the United States of China said that China is using an American newspaper to spread false news.
Last Wednesday, U.S. president of the United States, Donald Trump spoke of a special section of the newspaper Des Moines Register - newspaper in Iowa that was reported by the Chinese newspaper after the president of China said that he wanted to interfere with the American counselors of November 6, China.
According to Reuters newspaper, the case against the American election of the U.S. voters was identified with a new American campaign to combat China.
While it is acceptable for some foreign countries to put commercial messages into the press, China and the United States are arguing on business, a conflict that has caused both countries to pay large taxes on their own countries.
The tax imposed by China from the United States was to deal with Iowa’s merchants who are associated with the Trump Republican movement, said experts of China and the United States.
Terry Brustad, a representative of the United States of China and head of the large exporter of agriculture in China, says that China’s activities have affected the workers, farmers, and merchants in the United States.
Writing in the newspaper Des Moines Register, a Brantad said that "China is writing too much of it by producing false commercial messages in our hands.."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using the freedom of speech and freedom of journalists that the American is proud to pay for the commercial media in Des Moines Register," wrote the Branstad newspaper.
"Unfortunately, at a newspaper market here in Beijing, you find few antidiscrimination words and you will not see any of the lights on the Chinese economic problems, since the media are in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," wrote.
Without mentioning its newspaper, they added that ‘ one of the best - known Chinese newspapers has refused to publish its contents.
The Republican Commission appoints Women’s Rights at the Kavanaugh Project, Researchers for Warning
While many leaders of the Republican movement agree with the choice of the Brett Kavanaugh to be a judge in the Supreme Court even of the Kavanaugh is suspected of attempting to rape mothers, experts say that this will cause problems, especially from mothers on coming taxes.
The issue has stirred up much anger, and the Republican group has openly declared it ready for the election of the Kavanaugh.
These things can never be recovered," says Grant Reeher, professor of political studies at Maxwell University in Syracuse, speaking to the newspaper The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher believes that support for a FBI survey carried out by Jeff Flake, a professional counselor in Arizona, could reduce the anger of the armed forces.
"Mother will never forget what happened tomorrow morning or November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, leading counselor of the mother group called Move On on Friday, according to reports in the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, showers sing "November coming!" when they make parades in the obsolators of the Republican board where the leadership committee has decided to continue with the Kavanaugh election despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"Take an interest in the subject of democracy," Stu Rothenberg, political scientist, told the newspaper.
"People say that this interest has been too high; it is true.
But it could have been raised especially among women in rural areas as well as youths 18 to 29 who could vote, who did not like the president, but did not vote."
Although Ford’s testimony to the Kavanaugh’s attempts to be raped before public appearances, experts predicted that the Republican group would be furious if the election of the Kavanaugh people would be even stronger.
"These have shown a lack of accuracy of the GoP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to reports of NBC newspaper.
"It involves not only the final committee or the decision or the decision of the Kavanaugh as judges of the Supreme Court, but also the steps that the Republican party has managed to deal with the case and how she has dealt with the woman," Guy Cecil, U.S. Director of Needs, a group that is responsible for the decision of the Democrats.
On the other hand, Americans seem to have differing opinions on the subject for whom they can trust based on the evidence of the Ford and the Kavanaugh, and most are on the Kavanaugh.
The new YGov turned out that 41 percent of participants on the screen believed the evidence of Ford, and 35 percent said that they believed the testimony of the Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that the Kavanaugh had lied to their testimony, and 30 percent said that Ford had lied in their witnessing.
According to Flake, the FBI is studying the subject of Ford and Deborah Ramirez, reported in the Guardian newspaper.
A Ford taking an oath to the Board of Appeals in a parliament last week said that the drunken Kavanaugh wanted to be raped at the age of 17.
Ramirez said that Kavanaugh was introduced to them when they attended a festival in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The founder of the World Wide Web is trying to create a Web site that will compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, is setting up a Web page that compares the pages of Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The new project, the Inrupt, is a company that wants to continue where the Solid program was completed by Bernner- Lee.
Solid’s page allows users to make personal decisions regarding their personal property and to select the information they want to see.
In a special address to the Fest Company newspaper, the Berners-Lee spoke enthusiastically that the goal of Inrupt is "substantly."
"We have to do it now," he said about the page.
"It is the best news."
The program will use the Society’s software program to allow people to make up their own ‘ Web site ’ or POD.
The program can save, practice, calendar, music, and other services and services.
It is as if Google Drve, Microsoft Outlook, Black, and Spotify were grouped together at the same time.
A special feature of the Internet is that the user has the freedom to choose which individuals will see the message he wants to see.
The company refers to the introduction of the program as "to encourage people by means of the message."
The director of the company, John Bruce, suggested that our concept of the Cypriots is a product of goods, formulas, and techniques that can make Solid available to all.
The company is now Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety device for IBM, other computer operators who have been employed to prepare the program and various volunteers.
Since this week, the world’s computer technicians have been able to organize their own programs by using the equipment found on the Irish website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his colleagues do not communicate with the owners of "Fapobook and Google" on the subject to bring about a complete change that may cause all their notes to be fixed for a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In an article on the Medium page set on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the aim of the Iruptism is to provide commercial power and how the environment affects the environment in order to protect the mystery and benefit of the new program from Solid i."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the use of the Internet when he opened his Web site, World Wide Web site, to the concentration school of Massachusetts.
During the past months, Berners-Lee has been talking about the opposition that requires all on - line to be united.
Even after establishing Upup, Berners-Lee will continue to be its own and master of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I have great hope for this new program," said Berners- Lee.
Bernard Vann: A shepherd who took up the Victoria Cross after the first world war in WW1 received attention
The only pastor of the Church of England who satisfied the thirst of Cross Victoria at the time of World War II was a soldier in her own city even a hundred years ago.
Mr. Col. Bernard Vann discovered the thirst on September 29, 1918, in the acts of the Belshazzar and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a secret soldier, and he was unaware that he had contracted this high fever in the British army.
On Saturday the monument was displayed by her two sons on a map in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "the best" for a stone to be displayed a hundred years after his grandmother found the thirst.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on 29 September, Lt Col Vann led his soldiers across the Saint-Qentin River "on the head and the most shots and machine gun."
He then made rapid progress and was on his own led his soldiers to take up a weapon and kill the soldiers of three groups.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German secret soldier on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were ‘ things I know I can't do but teach us to be humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, grew up with a cocoon, which is led by the Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said he felt ‘ respected that he was a member of the party" and added that "the courage of the erring people is seen by many people doing memories of them when they are gone."
MMA’s followers did not sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, rather exposed to Pepa Pig
Just imagine, you did not sleep all night to watch the giant Bellator 206, and finally it was invisible.
The list from San Jose had 13 arguments, including six on a large card and was exhibited all night at UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moussi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to fight, the UK spectators are surprised when the program was changed into Pep Pig.
Others were not pleased to be awake at night, especially in expectation of the end of the war.
One successor has said in Twutter about the change of the program into children's children as a ‘ joke.'
"By a government order that at six o'clock in the morning these should not be shown so that they should change into a program for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator second chief of assistant and link, after being interviewed on the subject.
"Apparent pigs," yes."
The president of the Bellor Scott Coker company will answer for their program plans to involve UK spectators in the future.
We think about reviewing the program, and I think we might be able to do that," Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock on Sunday morning there, and we can't do this until Sunday our time, Monday time.
But we work hard to make the best of it.
Of course, the minute minute the writing was in existence, and the text was not.
We had to work hard to repair it, and we thought it was something mechanical.
It was not so with the government.
I promise you that this will never happen again.
We will prepare five conflicts instead of six - as we do and have tried to feed our pictures further and have made a mistake in doing so.
It's very difficult."
Interviews on the Desert Island: A Tom Daley 's privacy on the subject of a popular group
The Olympic Olympic athlete had grown up hiding about his favorite team, but this gave him the incentive to do it.
He said that he didn't understand until he got to high school that ‘ everyone isn't like me."
Speaking on the first four conferences on the Desert Island broadcast by Lauren Laverne, he said that he speaks of the rights of members of the opposite sex to give them a ‘ hope. ’
She also said that being a parent would make her focus on her career in sports.
The program’s program, which featured the release of a nursing home for several months, ended with my being absent from the regular program.
Regarding the first program of Laverne’s program, Daley said that as he grows up, he feels that he feels likes" because it was "not acceptable to love boys and girls."
She said: "To this day I feel left out and a feeling of being different from other people and things that have encouraged me and given me the strength to do well in my games."
He wants to show people that he is his ‘ own, ’ he said, that he will not stumble anyone when he comes to know the group that he loves.
This year the winner of the lottery is known to be a champion of the rights of homosexuals and is used to participate in the Commonwealth Act in Australia to request the legal right to enter marriage.
She said she speaks because she feels she has a chance to remain free even if she has confessed that she loves her peers so much that she wants to give "an encouragement" to others.
The actor who won three international films said that the fall in love with the American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "interested me."
Dayley married the filmmakers, who also won the medal in Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was, but he said that the age difference was nothing more.
"If you have a lot of things at this time" – he still participates in the Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer for the next three years -- he said it was difficult to find someone who had met the doors he had encountered.
In June the family became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said that their “view of things" had changed.
"If you ask me a year ago, I think I'll be more than a gold nose." He said.
"But do you know? There are more good things than the Olympic gold medals.
I am of the gold of Olympia and Robbie.
Her son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after learning brain cancer.
Dayley said that her father did not believe that she was going to die, and one of his questions before he died was to see if they had found out that he wanted to be in line for a future match in London in 2012.
"I didn't tell them that you won't be in the future because you will be dead," he said.
"I held them by the way she died and it was when she died that I realized she wasn't eternal," she said.
The following year, Dalia entered the 2012 Olympics and won awards.
"I just knew that this was my dream of swimming in front of the audience at the Olympic Games, and there was nothing more than that," he said.
This also encouraged his first choice of Poud’s song - song song by Heather Small, which encouraged him to prepare for the Olympic Games and still gives him a foothold.
Desert Island Discs are located on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson whose career has dropped was left outside in the Ryder Sunday cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States has been making a history of Sunday when playing his 47 - character set in the Ryder cup, but he must play more than he has played in the middle to prevent it from becoming an uncomfortable.
Mickelson, who plays the 12th ball at the end of the two years, was placed outside and played instead by a top athlete, Jim Furryk in four football games with four players.
Instead of being one of the players on that day, the success of the American five - time champion was just talking to his friends and making preparations to raise his career.
A 48-year-old player who was not the most dangerous during play, is not the best players in the Le Golf National team, where long - distance soccer is a poor sport.
And if the game is not too dangerous, Mickelson will meet Francesco Molinari, a British athlete who played with Tommy Fleetwood, who is the first to play in the game and won four of their games this week.
If American athletes, who stay four percent while they start out on a 12 - to - one game, can swim, so much so that Mickelson’s shows can be useful.
Furryk says that he has confidence in the expert, but he doesn’t say much.
"He understood what to do today, he thanked me and hugged me and told me that he was ready for the next day's play," Furryk said.
"He is independent of himself.
He is an expert on temperature and has done a lot of kayaks in the past, as well as this week.
I don’t expect him to play two games.
I expect them to perform many plays, but that is the way it is supposed to have been.
She wants to play like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickleson shows the Nick Faldo in the form of a series of plays in the Ryder cup.
This will bring his performance to a conclusion that is not the same as how he is playing alone.
Mickelson won 18 times as much as 20 times as 7 times, but Furryk says that its presence encourages his team.
"He’s fun, sabote, fun, and like to visit people, and is a good person to have a team," he explained.
"I think young athletes were happy to play with him this week, which was fun to see.
He gives more than play."
The leader of a European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that their progress could be compromised
Thomas Bjorn knows from past instances that their guidance through the Ruder cup can easily change and become a difficult object to protect it.
A Danish athlete played his first team in Valderrama in 1999, where his leader, Sever Ballestero, led five percent above the American team, only to win at a minimum of 141,6782 to 131.
"I remind myself that we were going very well in Valderrama; we were traveling to Brookline, where we had been defeated, and in Valderrama where we had won, but with few notes," Bjorn, after seeing a good team in 2018 winning 5-3 Friday and in the evening to take the lead in Le Golflf National competition.
So history teaches everyone in the stadium that the games did not end up completely.
We must exert ourselves vigorously.
We must go to the theater and do the best.
The movie never completely disappeared, and we received a lot of notes.
Our aim is to try to win the cup, and this is where we must focus our attention.
I have always said that I am interested in the 12 players in our team, and we know who we are playing the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his athletes played in the tough soccer stadium, Bjorn said: "I can't feel myself alone.
The games are big.
Everyone’s skills will be seen in the future, and this is a challenge.
It is good to play with your toy when things are going well, but to play on yourself, when the players are fully tested.
The message that should be given to the athletes is that they should take the lead in the games themselves.
In this case you leave your player with you, and he shall do his own work."
In contrast with the Bjorn team, Jim Furryk will want his athletes to have a more balanced life than did either Jordan Spieth or Justin Thomas, who won three percent.
Furryk himself has been present on both sides of the change, when he has been a team that won in Brookine before being a team that was defeated when the European team ‘ performed miracles" in Medinah.
"I remember anything," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, a leader in 1999, encouraged his players by the last day of the drama.
"We have 12 games, but we must stand up first, as you have seen in Brookline and Medinah.
If this happens at a central level, the pressure can be very great.
We have organized our games and have played games in an indication that we want to do wonderful things tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to initiate the lead of the friends and will play with Rory Mcllroy in major games, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play with the European team players according to the series.
"I put these players in this way because I believe they will help us to the end," he said when speaking about his choice of players in private games.
The founding of a German warship has also been under way
A new German warship was to be established in 2014 instead of the old ship used for the Cold War but not to work until tomorrow because of the deterioration of the ship's program and the change of trees, the country's newspaper said.
According to reports in the newspaper Die Zeit’s interview with a prophet of the army, the establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz' ship," the new Baden-Wuerttemberg ship has been changed until the first part of 2019.
The ship had to be used by the military in 2014, but the difficulty in bringing it into contact with the establishment of the ship.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that were purchased in 2007 will replace the Bremen ships.
We hear of them with skyrocketing guns, gas bombs, and other missiles, as well as of modern - day flying devices that cannot be detected.
Other essential factors are that the ships may work long before they are prepared to use the ships away from our ports for two years.
However, the delay in the use of these ships that would alter the use of German society in other countries - means that the use of them will be possible to survive, reports Die Zeit.
The F125 mission was notorious last year, when the German navy refused to set up the ship and returned it to the station of Blohm and Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time he had been caught off guard and returned the train to a railway company.
The reasons for returning the ship are not clear, but German newspapers have announced that there were ‘ trouble and necessary programs and goods in the ship' that make the ship useless when used.
The difficulty of the program was such that Baden-Wuerttemberg ships must carry 120 - half of the military passengers on the ancient Bremen ships.
In addition, the ships were known to be heavily armed, with a reduction in efficiency and a resistance to the development of the fleet.
The Rheinland-Pfalz ships weigh some 7,000 tons, meaning that they are twice as heavy as the ships used by the German military in World War II.
Apart from the breakdown of the ship's materials, the total cost of training for these ships, as well as the cost of training ships.
It is estimated that it reached  now as much as £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion, U.S.) — the equivalent of two dollars (U.S.).
The problems affecting the ships are becoming a necessary factor when it is reported that the German navy’s fleet is on the decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Per Bartels, head of a safety committee in the German parliament, admitted that they had been given a "wivering."
The officer said that it had been long since the old ships were out of use but no replacements were provided.
He concluded that in Baden - Wilsttemberg, there was no ship to be used by the Austrians.
National Trust illuminates the lives of ants
A new study carried out in a household in Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the hunting system for food.
It is hoped that what he has discovered will also expose new species and help improve future maintenance activities.
A scientific study conducted by the National Trust for Scotland will examine well - known species of soprano epistrelles as well as those of the blue beetles and Daubenton in Invehewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special photographs will be placed around the area needed to follow the event of the bats throughout the course of the period.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also do research on walking in different locations using hand - research tools.
A test of the sound produced by experts will reveal the volume of bats ’ calls and what they are doing.
Museums may also have a wide range of geographic details and their value.
Rob Dewar, an NTS security adviser, believes that the results will reveal areas that are vital to bats and where they are used in any form.
This will help you to see the value of caring for their land, such as planting a fine plant and caring for the palm and related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically during the past century.
They are under the threat of construction and development that affects how ants gather to relax during the day and lose their habitat.
Wind - and - light systems can also pose threats, such as paper that capture flies and other building materials, as well as by cats.
Ants are not very blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are even more useful than their eyes when they want to catch an animal.
They use a means to identify flies and flying obstacles.
NTS, which oversees 270 ancient buildings, 38 vital gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] throughout the country, consider bats to be important.
It consists of ten well - trained experts, often doing research, examining the places where ants gather for rest during the day and sometimes taking steps to rescue.
The organization has also established one and only bred park in the Scottland of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, the eight species in Scotland.
Director David Thompson said that the site is a good place for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent bog environment," he said.
"We have many old buildings, old trees, and all good places.
But there is much about bats that are not yet known, so the work we work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more of what is needed to survive."
He also spoke of the need to search the bats before repairing the home because it is destroying one of the breeding grounds where the ants can kill the female and 400 children, and this could kill all the bats in the area.
Ants are protected and not allowed to kill, torture, or destroy their environment.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of Scotland’s Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged public support.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our ants, and most of our species do not know how they are.
Ronaldo refuses to take over and defend himself in German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the case has been accused of rape by "false stories," saying that people want to be exalted" by his name.
The lawyer wanted to publish the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published this article.
An American actor in Portugal and Juventus is accused of rape by Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he paid him $37,000 to avoid this incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in the video Instagram Live to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the presentation, 33 - year - old Ronaldo denounced the reports as "false stories."
"No, no, no.
What he says today is a fictional story," the winner of Ballon d'or five times did so through a camera.
"They want to exalt themselves by my name.
Not unusual
They want to be known by my name, but it is the kind of work that they do.
I am a happy but friendly person, "The athlete added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to copy Der Spiegel on the subject, which is said to be "and unconventional reports on secret questions," according to Reuters.
The critic Christian Schchertz said that the player may ask for tears from the extent to which he is affected by the extent of the case, which should be the case of the greatest person's reputation and rights in recent years."
It was said that it took place in the Palms Hotel and Casino rooms in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in the night camp, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the theater, where they had been arrested, according to the papers stored at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga is said to have bowed after what she said and told her that it is "99% good man" who has failed with "1%."
Ronaldo’s documents say that he was convinced that the two had sex, but they did so together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station where the images of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later she agreed to resolve the matter on her own because she saw that she was "in fear of reprisal" and was concerned "to be embarrassed in society."
The 34 - year - old girl says that she wants to change the decision on her own, but she continues to suffer the consequences.
Ronaldo was about to win the Real Madrid team from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer he moved to Jave, a large team in Italy, in an agreement of Ş100 million dollars.
Brexit: UK comes to feel regret at all times and about the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will never regret it at all time" if it loses its role as a world number in developing cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark says.
He also said that it "shows" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain is released from the EU without colliding it can temporarily stop the production of the factory at Burkaston, near Derby.
"We want a unity," said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer said that the delay at the border if there is no agreement on the subject of Brexit can cause damage to the job.
The Burma - provided Ministry of the Auris and Aventanis had produced some 150,000 cars last year when 90 percent of them were sent to other European countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of March, we can see the construction projects in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, senior officer in Toyota, Burkaston.
Some UK car manufacturers spoke of their fears and the matter of leaving the EU without a joint agreement on how to purchase and sell between countries, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will shut down his Mining factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
A major concern for car manufacturers is that the issue of uncertainty about transporting goods to consumers if there is a difference in friction between Brexit.
Toyta makes her cars "such as a request" for her clients, and the fuel for cars comes every 37 minutes from the UK and the EU vendors on vehicles that are made in accordance with the application of customers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a cocoon on March 29, there may be problems on the border that factories say can cause delay and the lack of auto causes.
It would not be possible for Toyita to hold a one - day invention in her own Derbyshire factory, the company has said, so it can be stopped.
The Theresa May of the next relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, said Clark, is put to avoid delays.
"We want to be united. We would like to have a very good partnership that would allow me to talk not only about winning now but to take advantage of it, "He told BBC Radio 4 on Today's program."
The evidence that comes not only from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue in a method that has been very successful in distributing goods to customers."
Toyota could not say how long it would be dried, but in time, it showed that the extra income could reduce the cost of the factory against other factories and eventually damage the work.
Peter Tsouvallris, who has been working in Burkaston for 24 years and has been working as a team in the United States on the factory, says that its members are deeply concerned: "In my early days, the loss of these jobs will never come to an end.
A government prophet said: "We have established an accurate and reliable arrangement for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein convention can be postponed, say White House officials
The high assembly of Donald Trump and second to the attorney Rod Rosenstein can be "waiting for another week" while the battle with selected before the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, said White House.
Rosenstein supervises a special engineer Robert Mueller, researcher of Russian elections, cooperation between Trump and Russia and what President can do to correct justice.
The issue of whether Trump will resign or not the prime judge, and thus the destruction of Mueller’s rights, has been a cause of gossip for months in Washington.
Early in this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had consulted without a drawing to draw a discussion with Trump and the possibility of exterminating the president by means of the 25th decree.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to White House, where reports were reported that he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would not want to remove Rosenstein from his office but that the convention was later postponed to be held simultaneously with the Senate committee of the Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Christine Blasey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the case of Kavanaugh, thus delaying the full vote of the Senate.
The writer of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein convention, he said: “The day of these things can be this week long, I can also see that it takes another week to consider the rest of what is going on in the main court.
But we will see how it ends and I like to have the journalists know the current news."
Some journalists might object: Sanders had never had a journalist in White House since September 10.
A roommate Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the loss of the meetings was not due to the hatred of the "addiction" in the media of "TV", even though he said: "I can't deny the fact that they like to be popular."
He then announced that the direct relationship between Trump and the journalists would increase.
"The President does more parts of questions and answers than any president who has ever lived," he said, adding without any proof: "See those numbers."
The press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "If the journalists have the opportunity to question the president of the United States directly, it is better than to talk with me.
We are trying very hard to do this and have seen us do this a few weeks ago, instead of a meeting with the journalists in which you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump is always able to answer questions after they leave White House or engage in conversation or share it with responsible ones.
The meetings of individual journalists are relatively small.
In New York the president of the United States may now be able to explain why, and at times, he has made some uninterested comments to the media.
A health - care secretary writes to EU workers in HS Scotland because of the fear of Brexit
A health secretary has written to workers in the EU in Scotland’s NHS to describe the country’s gratitude and want to stay in Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MCS sent less than six months to UK to the EU.
The Scottish government has already offered to cover the cost of asking the EU citizens for their services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, the debate between the UN and the EU on the matter of departure continues to continue, and I hope that the election will occur at the end of this rainy season.
But the U.S. government has also encouraged planning for what might happen if there is no unity.
I know it will be a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat now how I appreciate the contributions of each worker, regardless of where he comes from.
My friends from all over the EU countries, and more and more, come to be known as experts in the field of health, as well as to help the sick and the areas in which we serve.
Scotland is your permanent home, and we would like you to be here."
Christion Abercrombie Has Unexpected Surgery
The players behind the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was operated after a head injury on Saturday when his team gave way to 31 of his team and the Vanderbilt Commondores team, Mike Organ, a Tennessee journalist.
Rod Reed told the journalists that the time that the first section was about to end was approaching.
"He came alongside and then fainted," Reed said.
The teachers and doctors put Abercrombie on oxygen in the yard before putting her on a pillow and taking her to the hospital for better lighting.
A director of the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from an operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘ there is no information about her initial injuries" and that the Tennessee State is searching for a time when she was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is playing the first time in a Tennese State team from Illinois.
Before leaving the theater on Saturday, he gathered and dropped the other team five times, resulting in a permanent ride of 18 times.
Foreign customers will be paid higher prices if they buy land at the UK
Foreign customers will have to pay higher prices if they buy property in the UN, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This view challenges Corbyn’s success in attracting young ones to win a favor
Additional taxes will be paid to those who do not pay UK
Economics hope to earn 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
When foreign customers pay a high tax in UK - and extras will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will be advertised today.
This view seems to interfere with the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people to win him by promises to offer cheap housing and to improve those who have earned a lot of money.
Additional taxes will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay UK, and extra funds will contribute to the State’s sleep problems under the walls.
In addition, they include the tax collection currently paid here, including the high sections that were established two years ago in old homes and purchased homes to make up about three percent.
Economically, they expect to earn as much as 120 million dollars a year.
About 13 percent of London’s new building projects are purchased by non - UK citizens, raising trees and making it difficult for first consumers to make up the first part of a house.
Most of the rich areas in the country - especially within large cities have been like ‘ empty villages ’ as a result of the increasing number of foreign consumers living abroad.
This new law comes within a few weeks after the Boris Johnson declared that the tax should be reduced in order to help many young people build the first house.
They have denounced large construction firms for raising home prices to buy land but not use, and they encouraged Mrs. May to leave their assignments in low - cost homes in order to set up the "mainture" of the British.
Corbyn has announced a list of fine plans for new buildings, which includes maintenance of the rent and removal of the "free".
They also want to give the swallows great energy to build a new house.
She said: "Last year I gave my first duty to restore British dreams - to improve life for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a better life here.
However, it may not be true that it is easy for non-UK persons, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens.
For many people, having a house is considered impossible, and sleeping under the bridges is still a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to teach a Scotland team'
Sunder Jack Ross is said to "My main goal is "to become a teacher of a Scottish team at one time.
Born in Scotland, 42 years of age, he is enjoying a refresher job in the North-Eas East, still at the third level in the League One, and three percent from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after leading St Merren back to Scottish Premiership for the rest of the year.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I found a B level and so," Ross told the Sports of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up helping Scotland in Hampden very much with my father when I was a child, and it always reminds me of the past.
The opportunity will come, unless I have done well to correct the clubs.
The first Loss as Sunderland manager was Dick Advocaat, David Moes, Sam Allahyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo di Canio.
An early teacher of the Alloa Athletics says that he was not afraid to follow the well - known names in such a large school, having rejected the claims made by Barsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success here will be confirmed by the answer to the question 'Will I be able to return this club to the Premirer League?'
Because of the design and characteristics found in the library, it appears to be of the Premirer League, he said.
"It's a very difficult task to get there, but I just feel like I'm going to have this club if I can take it back there."
Ross has been in charge for only three years, having served for a long time as an assistant to Dambarton camp and a 15 - month period as a regular staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa not to be brought down from the third grade, and he helped the nearby St Merren team to win the contest.
And Ross is said to feel better now than he did at the time in play with Clyde, Hartlepolol, Falkirk, St Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
It may have been time to make a big choice, "remembering, teaching the Alloa club.
"I really believed that oversight was more appropriate to me than to play.
It feels strange because of my good success, my well - being, my social life, and other interests.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure, but the work of oversight is very good for me.
I always want to watch and now do it, I feel much better than in my old life."

Summer temperatures have benefited Britain's alcohol companies who are suffering but have caused many problems in restaurants.
Alcohol dealers had seen a 2.7% increase in the sales of alcohol in July - but lost 4.8 percent in restaurants, according to figures.
Peter Martin, CGA, business executives, who write these statistics, said: ‘ The sun’s passing away and taking an unexpected assignment in England’s World Cup Games will make July events similar to June, while the sellers of alcohol saw a 2.8 - percent increase, apart from fast - suffering restaurants.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurants in June was passed in July.
Everyone who sells drinks or drinks seems to be doing the same.
The food and drink industries have also suffered during the summer, though they are not as uncomfortable as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink.
Improved alcohol consumption saw an increase of 6.6 percent in the same month, and food vendors dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a hospitable RSM visitor, said: "The following is continuing on what we have seen since late April.
Climate change and social or play activities have a direct effect on the consumer market outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to suffer, and the reduction of 4.8 percent annual purchases is a major problem, especially in the increase in demand.
A long, hot summer may not be a good time for food vendors and the passing of time will show that the colds we encounter in August will provide needed relief.
The increase in the sales of alcohol and consumers, including the recently opened business, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a reduction in the production of new products.
Coffer Peach Tacker is responsible to investigate the UK alcohol and restaurants and to gather and monitor 47 groups, which have a value of $9 billion, and their productions are more reliable.
One out of five children has a secret peace account hidden from their parents
One of the five 11 - year - olds who carry their parents and teachers ’ secret social insurance accounts
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of false statements of the "Insta."
This article added to the fear that pornography was sent
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "great" statement to show their parents
One of five children is 11 - year - olds who are making ice creams that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a number of false statements of the "Insta" Web site on the Internet during the distribution of Instagram pictures.
This article added to the fear that pornography was sent
Twenty percent of the students said that they have white information to identify their parents, but they also have other secrets.
One mother who had met her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret sister observed that the young girl was encouraging others to ‘ rape her. ’
Research, of the Marriage Awares UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistress (HMC) in private schools (HMC), found 40 children in the 11th to 18th century that they had two accounts, and half of them agree to keep secret accounts.
An official of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is shocking that many young people are tempted to make chat rooms online without their parents and teachers.
Eidhh Doyle will be the "word of the runners" on the Scottish Atletics Commission
Eliidh Doyle has been appointed a member of the Scotth Attaltics as the chairman of the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle, a Scotsman who competed in athletic competitions with Ian Beattie, described the choice as a good chance for those who improved the sport to benefit from many of the world’s experiences over the past ten years.
"Eidh has great respect for all the Scotth, the UK, and the world's athletes, and we believe that the athlete athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him to this group," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be like a jog, and I hope I can really help to improve the game in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 - and 400 - foot [200 m] meter and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games among the four Olympic goldes he discovered and is now a well - known BBC specialist, left unable to walk with a drug problem.
He wrote on Twutter: "The past month I had a stroke.
I can’t walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover or not.
It was a difficult job, but I recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am doing fast running!
Thank you for the encouraging message!"
The Internet has brought a wide range of comments from the Internet, compared with women and dairy cattle
The milk - pumping company has dropped a variety of comments on the Internet and a comparison of mothers feeding and beef cattle being forced.
In order to "open" a silent tap, Elvie's company has set up a music video with a granary of the independence that it offers to nursing mothers.
The four real mothers in the milk herd dance the grass with the words "Yes, I was sitting, but you can't see the tail" and "If you didn't realize that these are not the milk of the cow, my own breasts."
The song continued: "Congratulation, greeting, feeding the children, greeting, greeting, and greeting my mother."
However, this ads, which have been broadcast on the Facebook page of the company, have created a supercomputer on the Internet.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of remarks, the film has been viewed differently by viewers, many of whom are said to show the "hoals" of the milk industry.
It is a very bad idea to use dairy cattle to transport the machine.
As we should take in and give birth to produce milk, unless their children are removed within a few days after giving birth, they have been written another.
Elvie’s breastpiece is well suited inside the labyrinth (Elvie / Mother)
Another said: "It’s sad for both mother and child.
But why don't you use the breast milk waved to the care of mothers?"
Someone added: ‘ Such inconsistent advertising."
Some preferred the offer, while one mother admitted that this song was "I’m fun."
"I think it has a good idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast - feeding.
Screaming makes me feel like a cow.
This promotion is not necessary but I am not angry with it.
This is a wise thing, "So wrote another.
Another said: "This is an interesting discharge of mothers (often at work or in the toilet) and feeling like "the milk cows."
This is not a campaign to glorify or judge the milk industry.
At the end of the film, a group of women confesses that all of them had secret clubs.
The idea of these spices is consistent in understanding that many breast - feeding mothers claim to feel like cattle.
Elvie Pummp, however, works in silence, has no noses or tubes and is well fitted in palm clothes, and gives the mother the right to move, to touch their children, even to go elsewhere.
Children Barin’s partner and ECD on Mother also said: "Elvie Pummp is such a new thing that should be introduced with care and enthusiasm.
Comparing the comparison between the mother and the milk cows, we wanted to keep the breast pumping and her problems clear, showing them in an interesting and easy - to - remember way of recalling the freedom that this new camp will bring.
This is not the first time in Elvie’s camp.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two was present at a show showing that Marta Jabowski is using the camp.
Hundreds of immigrants take refuge in the Texan Desert
The number of children moving to another country has increased and even crossed the border over the month has not changed, perhaps because of fears and the underlying issue of the Trump government that has made it difficult to provide children with helpers.
Traditionally, many of the volunteers have moved to another country without registration, and they are afraid of losing their privilege of living in that country when they come looking for a child to help.
The problem was growing in June, while the authorities declared that the applicants and other adults in their families had to give their fingers, that is, share with the authorities in the entry and discharge of the people at the border.
Last Sabbath, Matthew Albence, chief of the Immiral and Customs Infloring, testified before the Congress that the council had arrested many people who had registered to help these children who came alone.
The commission later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no record of criminal activity.
"About 80 percent of the people who support their family or family members are illegal in the country, and most of these are foreigners who have a history of crime.
That is why we continue to search for these people, the Albences.
In order to help the children actively, the authorities have established new laws that require some of them to appear in court during one month of their custody, not after 60 days, as they used to do, according to the staff.
Many will appear on the screen, rather than in the direct way, by offering their request to a world judge.
Those who may seem unworthy of help will be eagerly restored to their homeland.
The longer the children stay in tents, the greater their risk of anxiety or frustration, the greater the risk of violence or escape, depending on the sleep workers and reports that have come out of order in recent months.
The lawyers said that grievances grow in such large areas as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are often ignored because of the size of such areas.
They added that bringing children to a fast - food camp for preparing them for a heart or socializing with one another can be devastating for many who are already suffering.
Syria tells the war force in the country’s US, France, and Turkey to evacuate quickly
Addressing the UN General Assembly as Foreign Minister Walid al - Moulem also invited refugees from Syria to come home, even in the eighth year of the world war.
Moualem, also the second of the Chief Minister, said that these foreign soldiers were illegal, falsely charged against terrorism, and "will be punished equally."
"It should be to leave immediately without any comment," said the conference.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He also said that Damascus would continue this holy war until we had wiped out all the parts of Syria of all the bands of the terrorists and the "unauthorized foreigners."
The United States has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, especially those who train and discipline troops in Kurdish as well as the Arabs against President Bashar al - Assad.
France is home to more than a thousand military personnel in a war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moulem said it was good for them to return, and he had condemned "the other western countries" because the "exploiting of a morbid fear" that made the refugees not want to return.
"We have asked foreign countries and international agencies to help those who want to return," he said.
"They include politics on a matter that should be only for the benefit of the community."
The United States and the European Union say that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until the political alliance between Assad and opposers can stop war.
The UN official says that the recent cooperation between Russia and Turkey to establish a last refuge place with many insurgents has provided an opportunity for further political debate.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey has prevented over three million people from suffering at the hands of the Syrian general and his three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, argued that the treaty "has a final time" and shows hope that soldiers will strike the jihadsts, including the Nusra Front's armed forces against Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed."
A minister of the UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to gather the first meeting of the new government committee as well as anti - Syrian parties to settle the rules of Syria after the war and to establish a method of decision making.
Moualem explained how the Syrian government is involved in this committee, saying that the organization's work should be intended to ‘ re - review the laws of the country, ’ and warn the people who want to interfere with the project.
Why Trunmp Second Success
With those views, A Trump will be elected again in 2020 elections unless, like many spectators, judgment and crime end his leadership before it is too late.
In these it may be as if the "The most amazing end of leadership is more than ever"
From this point on, there are no suggestions for the viewer’s wearyness.
Since 2014, the number of night viewers has grown from 2 to 1.5 million in CNN and from 3 to 1.6 million in NSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million night - watchers, ranging from 1.7 million to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has a wide range of displays and 3.5 million viewers on the main night of the talk.
"This is a problem that people are being brought up because we don't understand it well," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Depigned Survival," which refers to the secretary of president who becomes president after the destruction has devastated Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comicist and writer "JUS the Fulny Parts: And a Few Heart Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another idea
They recall the time when they took a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections took place.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
She said, "Because she makes me laugh," "Mama Scovell told me.
This is a cause for rejoicing.

Large amounts of money are used to support the general election of counselors
Not surprisingly, the 17th section of Pennsylvania sees the widespread use of funds, thanks to the reconstitution of law sections that allowed two people to compete on the same seat.
The recent development of a map of the Pittsburgh region allows the Conor Lamb who represents the Democrat party to buy a violet that won his seat in another district in a recent special election.
Lamb competes with a member of the Republican group, Keith Rothfus, now shutting out the 12th - year - old state of Pennsylvania, which is in close contact with a new section of 17.
Maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed down a decision in January that the former sections were changed in favor of the Republican party.
The competition in this new section of the 17th has created a huge expenditure on the project between the Democratic Campaign DRM Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campal Committee (NRCC).
The name of the Lamb has become a popular name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the widely held election of the 18th section of Pennsylvania.
This assignment has been a section of the Republican Party for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the province by 20 percent.
Political experts have given Democrats a relatively small measure of success.
U.S.
The Dominican Republic and Panama had already been working with Beijing, with no major ban from Washington.
The Trump had lovingly held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his fellows had removed the Trump.
The U.S. government officials decided to summon American officials who were working in El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama because of the ‘ recent introductions no longer known in Taiwan," Herather Nauert, secretary of the department, said in his opening words of this month.
But it is generally thought to be given to El Salvador, which has received an estimated $140 million (U.S.) donations from the United States in 2017, including drug management, development, and financial help.
The punishments, which involve cutting down on property and not paying taxes, would be severe in Central America, where many people were unemployed and full of life’s crime.
While the conference was in progress, the authorities in North America and Central America postponed the convention in hopes that it would be held later that described security and material goods to follow this one last year that seemed to be the means of overcoming immigrants to the United States.
But by mid - September, the local authorities indicated that they wanted the meeting to progress, and I immediately concluded any suggestion that punishments should be imposed in El Salvador.
The second to President Mike Pence is now preparing for the convention, which is now scheduled in mid - October, to highlight the importance of the convention, the delegates did.
In fact, three American delegates returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no placards from Washington.
The White House prophet Bolton refused to answer on the arguments presented by three American officers, including two officers, who agreed to discuss the internal conversations in a private way.
Their accounts were confirmed by foreign experts who are close to the management and said this in a private way.
Learn From the Past
The next article that will take place may be the release of Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s corruption, now seen in the literature of the people.
Mueller is also said to check to see if the Trump mission worked along with Russia to interfere with our decisions.
When the Constitutional House changes leadership, the Trump has found himself facing questions to answer to that body, as he is preparing to face a second hearing, and perhaps finally a court of his peers.
There are many questions to answer, and I do not mean that the demise of Trumps is inevitable even as they of Europe.
There are choices that all of us in all parts of the U.S.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to conspire against Hitler, unless West refused to help the Czech population in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible years that followed.
What has happened in the past has been through this unique history, and the order of democracy can be speedled or delayed by this.
A number of these experiences are being encountered in the United States right now.
What would we do if the Trump removed the job of Rod Rosenstein II from the Chief Minister of Research for Mueller?
Last year, Rosenstein has been in serious trouble since the paper also said that he had proposed a secret identity for the president and that the president is not qualified to be in office.
Rosenstein points out that The Times is not accurate.
"How will we answer if a recent request from F.B.I. to investigate the Brett Kavanaugh case is not enough or unjust - or if it is verified by a judge at the Supreme Court, even if there is sufficient evidence of rape and lying?
And above all, will we vote for counselors who will make Trump a defense of his case?
If we are unable to do so, it will take a long time for democracy to come.
But I am convinced that we are not failures, thanks to the training I had received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz with the same Nazi regime that used to live in my convent.
She survived and then moved to the United States, and 60 years later, I was sent to light a Sabbath tent on a table with swastika signs.
With such an inheritance, how can I be without hope for our future?"

Graham Dorrans, an actor of the Ringers team, believes that he can perform his team and the Rapid Vienna team
Ringers is playing at the door with the Rapid Vienna Thursday, following their match with the Spanish Villarreal team at the beginning of this month, the Ringer team must conquer the Australian team, which gives them the opportunity to go to another section in the second cup of European scholars of the League for the Group G.
The knee injury of the central player Graham Dorrans caused him to fail to play his first performance in the symmetrical team until the day he compared the power of the Villerrea team to 2 to 2 twins, but he believes that Ringers can use his performance as a good start of big things.
"What we found was important to us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old expert.
"We went into the stadium, hoping we could do well on the stage, and we got one minute.
At the end of the game, we may have been able to win the game, but the combination of power was just one thing.
They did well in the first section, and we did well the second part and were a team playing well that day.
The fourth is a big game in the UEFA contest.
Fortunately, we can take all three parts but then become very difficult as they won the game but then take our family guests at home and I hope we can stand and win the game.
The past year was difficult, for my injuries and other changes in the team were present.
Sports can be fun and exciting; the games are just right for you.
Maybe we can stand up now, forgetting about the past to do well."
Women stay awake because they fear the rewards they will pay
Although those involved in the survey had a clear idea of how to get attention, few people are talking to their brothers about it.
Nearly half of the researchers who studied in Natleside said that they talked to their wives about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they had spoken to their children about this.
"People want to be cared for by their relatives, but they don't take the initiative to talk on the subject," said Holly Snyder, second president of the Nationwide Life insurance company.
Here is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot arrange for your family to look after you if your needs are not met in advance.
Work with your instructor and family so that you can discuss just what treatment is and how to get attention, since decisions may be needed to determine the price.
Ask your financial mentor: Your mentor can also help you to find a way to earn the money.
Your choice of a long - term budget might include a long - term social insurance, a highly expensive life - insurance policy to help finance this money, or to create an insurance policy with your assets — if you have money.
Write your legal documents: Watch the battles of the law while you are traveling.
Find a health - care assistant instead of you to choose a reliable person to care for your medical care and to make sure that your needs are met by experts if you can't speak.
In addition, consider the matter of getting involved in your financial affairs.
You can choose a reliable person to make your own financial decisions and make sure that your debts are paid if you are not able to do so.
Don't forget the least: Suppose your elderly parents are seriously ill and are going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about health and health care?
Take brief notes to prepare:
"Not only is the money to be fixed, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
‘ What is the solution?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for that."

Government judges want victims charged with terrorism in NYC to receive an unusual death sentence
The judges in New York City want Sayfullo Saipov to be sentenced to death, where they have been convicted of terrorist activity in NYC and murder eight people (a strange decision that has not been handed over since 1953 by a government court.
Saipov, aged 30, is said to have used a loan at Home Depot to do terrorist work on a bicycle near the main street of West Side Higway in Lower Manhattan, killing both on foot and on the road in October.
In confirmation of the merit of the death sentence, judges must testify that Saipov " by accident" had killed eight people and had seriously wounded others, according to the decree of this decision, which was issued in the Southern District in New York.
All these cases involve capital punishment, according to a court order.
A few weeks after the trial, the Supreme Court found Saipov guilty of 22 cases of murder involving eight of the illegal methods, those of the highest court, and the crimes of violence and car destruction.
The case "was carefully prepared and carefully," the judges said, explaining how Saipov had dealt with a "fierous, cruel and fearful case."
"Samfullo Habillaevic Saipov has also caused injury to others, as well as sadness on the relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrruchi, Hern Diedo Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," a request concerning the decision.
Five of those affected were foreigners from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the Supreme Court of New York made a decision to kill.
The judge, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the decision of death in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being sentenced to serve the Soviet Union during the Cup War or Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg married couple were killed by a power station on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, indicated not to be affected by what he did during the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt better about what he had done, and the police did.
Saipov told officials that he had been encouraged to do this after watching ISIS’s movies on his phone, according to much of his case.
He also asked to show the IIS flag in his hospital room, which the police did.
He rejected the 22 charge.
David Patton, one of the Saipov's representatives, said he was ‘ disappointed" by the election of the state justice.
"We think the idea of accepting a death sentence instead of accepting an appeal to remain in prison and not having the opportunity to be released may add grief to anyone affected," Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had already asked the judges not to administer the death penalty.
NIGFRAG should oversee the discussion of Brexit
Nigel Farage promised that he would ‘ call a class of people like war' today on exhibitions at the General Assembly.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be 'enforced from the EU Ou - as one of the Theresa May counselors said that this is how they should handle conversations with the EU.
Peter Bone, who was back-handed, told people in Birmingham that the UK's 'had been released" by now if the Frameages had been the Secretary at Brexit' discussions.
But the problem that May face in returning the most difficult territories has been proved by Disconstituting Brexit to take part in some anti - Brexit exhibitions in the city.
He is endeavoring to make his plans succeed when opposed by the Brexit, the E.U, and the EU.
His colleagues insisted that they still try to cooperate with the Brussels even when they met with opposition and pressure to make the EU and the Labor Party choose between what they offer and the 'Regulator'.
The Bone had told a convention with a head to leave means to leave Solihull that he wanted to ‘ oppose the Brethren of Brexit'.
He also said that the Flagellants would have to take part in the territory and be assigned to contact Brussels.
'If this was how she was leading the article, we would have been out here,' she said.
Wellinqeugh’s MP added: 'I help Brexit' but we want to oppose the Brethren' League.
In his defense against the EU, he said: ‘ We did not fight the wars of the world to become slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The Bone rejected the assumption that people's views have changed since the 2016 vote: 'It is not true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain.'
Brexiter Andrea Genkyns were present at the exhibition too, telling the reporters: ‘ I just say: Chief Minister, listen to the people.
‘ Living in the EU is not required of people, and it cannot be accepted by opposers, nor is it necessary for our movement and the fighting forces who fight too hard to make decisions.
Please leave the EU and begin to be obedient to the people.'
To the mother of May, she added: ‘ Elders as prime minister keep their duties as they fulfill their promises.'
Flagge told the audience at the conference that politicians should be 'enforced' if they are unfaithful to the 2016 polls.
It is now a reliable subject between us - and our political organization, he said.
They are trying to be dishonest in the case of Brexit, and we are here to tell them that we are not letting you do this.'
In his message to the party he added: ‘ I want you to pressure our politicians, who have questionable ideas about Brexit.
‘ We invite the world's community as a war which fought against us in the case of Brexit and we will not rest until we become the United Kingdom independent, free and proud.'
In the meantime, the struggle to become a member of the EU led him through Birmingham to a two - hour meeting in the center of town.
Several opposers had raised placards that Against Brexit had set up this week.
The convention had opened with a fellow member of the Lord’s Lod Adonis Conservatives team on the issue of the security they had met with their computer program.
These are people who tell us that they have been able to establish the IT system in the country and all of Canada in addition, uninterrupted borders, free traffic in Ireland, have added.
‘ It’s all fun.
There is nothing better than Brexit, which added.
Warren wants "to think seriously" the matter of going to the president's election
A representative of Sen. Elizabeth Warren is said to consider the matter of going to the president's elections after the election of November.
Boston Globe says that a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Democracy spoke ahead of him at a convention held in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, often against President Donald Trump, expects him to be reappointed in November against GOD’s record Rep. Geoff Diehl, vice president of Trump’s 2016 zoologist at Massachusetts.
It is estimated that they will fight the Trump in 2020
Saturday afternoon’s program at Hokuta was his 36th - assembly and district convention to use question - and - answer sessions since Trump started working.
The one present asked him if he wanted to make a contract for the president.
Warren answered that it was time for my mother to go to Washington to repair our broken state, and this also included a high mother.
Another imprisoned to the death of the LSU’S hero
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday the arrest of a supposed guner who had shot and killed LSU SIMs Friday.
The Baton Rouge police had announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at 11: 00 a.m.

It was clearly evident that Valterri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday at another session that Mercedes's rules had a share on all the final steps.
Right from the start, Bottas started the game successfully, and Emililton has called the Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel was the one who led the competition, leading to Hamilton'' success.
Mercedes later arrived and left the rear of Vettel, but Hamilton continued after driving the wheels that had made the driver Ferrari free from the threat behind to protect the third.
Max Versappen started from the back of the procession and was the seventh at the end of the first vellum on his 21th birthday.
He then led a large section of the race where he picked up his tires so that he could have his wheels enthusiastically and finally locate Kimi Raikonen four times.
Later he came to the preparation site at 44 legs but was unable to add his speed to the remaining eight feet while Rainkonen took the fourth.
It was a very difficult day, since Valteri worked well at the end of the week and was a true witch doctor.
The female has done a very special job to have two winners, said Hamilton.
Medieval Masters of Communication
President Donald Trump hurled down a complaint at the Saturday meeting by the Minister Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that he had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to appeal to the High Court of Appeal Brett Kavanaugh on sexual morality.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of the evidence given by the Ford before the Senate Committee, but rather said that what is going on in the Senate is proving that the people are ‘ fierce and fierce and false.
"One of the best things that can happen in the last few days of Seth is, if you see, you will see harsh and angry people but are afraid and lying," he said.
"Look at the hidden article from the bug, but you hear 'iii, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do You Recall?
Did Dianne Feitstein, come out of the picture?
When you remember what they said... you brought them out to the open - air, ‘ What, what? ’
No, not at all.
I did not bring out the public.
Well, let us say.
We brought them out to the public?... No, we are not," thus added the Trump to the speech, which clearly shows that he speaks about the Internet.
A Feinstein was sent a letter to explain the details of the Kavanaugh case of the Ford during July of the previous July, and the article was published publicly in September - but the Feinsstein refused to accept the publicity from their office.
"I didn't hide anything from the subject that came with Ford, I didn't publicize it," reported the Senete Committee, according to The Hill.
"He told me it was a matter of mystery and I had kept it a secret."
Such intolerance did not please the president of the country, who spoke on Saturday’s talk like this: "I assure you, this was not a good way to speak with physical gestures.
He may not have done it, but it was the foul way of speaking through the body symptoms I have seen.
In an ongoing defense against the applicant’s right to commit sexual immorality against three women, the President said that the Democrats were using this term to achieve their own ends.
"Their purpose is to take back the force by any means.
You can see these people are really fearful, cruel, who care not for the victim because of the desire for power," said the leader, according to the Mediaite newspaper.

At the start of the “Belgium ” of Belfast Giants, two prizes were issued by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.

Dwyer encouraged the Giants ’ first break while he played his second one at the end of this night’s play.
The Dundee team, also at her door, had another idea, and Bouchard had a powerful drink in 2737 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran had played a professional ball in giving the Nielsen who had drunk the Dundee win that made the tiger lead for the first time at the end of the second session and had added another drink that brought all the arrows to five in these games.
The Giants, who have now won four games in five successive games, are preparing to meet Milton Keynes ’ team on the coming Friday.

The area is still plagued by severe earthquakes, and most of it has been ravaged by garbage in the city of Pallu.
Even at the risk of their lives, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place of work on a building that was thundering so hard on the Mutiyaras Al Jufri Airport.
He was left to help the modern - day bipolar patient Batik Air Fight 6321

We prepared a helicopter from Balingepan, Kalimantan, to take him to a good hospital in another city.
Sadly, she died this morning before arriving in Pallu.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll will disappear thousands of people from the disaster - prone branches in the country and say that it is difficult to reach the towns of Dontulaa, Sig, and Bouting.
"The number of deaths is believed to rise while other bodies are still under the garbage and many are not included to see if they are still alive," said Sutopo Pro Nugroho Prophet.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] of waves devastate the planet, and the funeral of all who have died on Sunday will occur.
Military and commercial planes are providing assistance and other services.
The 35 - year - old mother told Skyky News: "Every time an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is not easily available.
Things are being stolen in small markets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Red Cross in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a problem, but it can develop.
The president of Indonesia Joko Widdo came to Sunday Order and told the soldiers of the country: "I beg all of you to work day and night so that you can complete any task involving transport.
Are you ready to do this?

Aer Niugin landing in Micronesia: Air Niugin airline has announced that one person is not still on the plane when it falls into the water.
The company, the owner of a plane that has fallen into the Pacific Ocean, has also announced that man is simply out of reach, once it was created that both of them were saved when the plane sank.
The Air Niugini airline announced that by the end of the day, one man had been lost.
In fact, they are now closely associated with foreign leaders, health - care professionals, and research specialists.
The company has no idea of how many other poor men are coming to know, such as her age or her homeland.
The boatmen in the area had done their duty to save the aircraft as soon as it fell into the water when they were to dock at the Chuuk island airport.
Some authorities have announced that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers had not yet been released from the Saturday hospital, but they were all in good condition.
The actual cause of the accident has not been found or possible.
The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had fallen into the water just before it went to the airport.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the road.
Aircraft pilot Bill Jaynes said that the plane is very hot when it says it is.
"This is a wonderful thing," said Jayne.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to cross the waist to the airport on which he was sinking.
And he said that the crews displayed bark and were calling out loud, and he said that he had suffered a slight injury in the head.

Experts prescribe a series of events until the mother was burned alive
The prosecutor interrupted the Saturday charge of the father who was convicted of burning Mississippi’s surviving wife in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett spent many hours witnessing as an expert witness in intelligent research.
He explained the court’s use of cell phones to include the conduct of 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old beater, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he had received much about the location from a number of handphones he had shown that Tellis had Chambers the night after death, which contradicted what he had said before, Clairion Ledger said.
When he was shown that he had a phone call with Chambers when he reportedly had a friend of Michael Sanford, the police went to talk with Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday was not a town that very day.
When the judges asked whether Tellis was true when they said they were Sanford's car that night, Sanford called it a ‘ liar, because my car was at Nashville right away. ’
Another argument is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers nearly two weeks after his death.
Evidence from mobile phones indicates that they know each other for just one week.
Rowlett says that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis removed the inscriptions of Chambers, many of which were sung by his phone.
"Adam throws it out of his life," said Hale.
An opposer is expected to present his final Sunday opposition.
The judge said that he expected the case to be conducted on the same day.
A group called High Breed: What is the background of Hip hapu music?
Three hip - hop performers are considering to change the way that the rock has some flaws in utilizing a message of encouragement in their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol’s city, has stopped singing purely for political reasons and to deal with the problems of daily life.
The group’s feelings are to replace the band’s musical compositions with new ones.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Commons have seen a recent revival in the UK through musicians such as Cala and Lowkey.
A black man?
The NY child carer blames one family for sending a message of ‘ prejudice. ’
The NY child carer blames one family for sending a message of prejudice after receiving a lost message from the mother, lamenting that she was a "one black man."
The family refuses to be partial, saying that the case is like a ‘ how to steal."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day to work in 2016.
"YIIIIIIIIIIIIYE ALERT," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmanto in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending the letter to her husband, she sent Mother Maurice, twice.
Recognizing his error, Plasco-Flaxm resigned Sister Maurice, saying that she was the former caretaker of their children, who was of African-American descent, had worked at a paid job and instead hopes to find someone from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice paid a full - time job and was assigned home to Urber.
Now, Maurice is blaming the family for the loss of a job, and she wants to be paid $350 a day for the work of the music concert that she was doing before this union was established.
"I want to show them, you don't do things this way," she told Post Friday and added "I know it's prejudice."
The victims had defended themselves against racial prejudice, saying that quitting Maurice was the wise thing to do, fearing that they would not trust her if they disappointed her.
"My wife sent her something that she doesn't want to say.
He is not partial.
We are not partial," the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have made for fear, even if it is not deliberate?
Your new child?
You people.."
Comparing the case to the "kocking method," Plasco said his wife was only two months old and was "in the most difficult time."
" Can you go out to fight against someone who is in the situation?
It is not the best thing to do," a bank businessman added.
While the case is still in force, the public prosecutor’s office is quick to criticize the family’s lack of health care and reproofs for their actions and emotions.
The publishers of Paddington's book are afraid that readers cannot imagine a bear speaking, a new letter revealing this.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was admitted after the book was approved, said regarding the letter: "I find it difficult to replace someone who reads the book before the publication.
It is a joy to know now what we know of this remarkable victory of Paddington."
Regarding his father, an ancient BBC artist before being encouraged to write a book of children and a young bear may be afraid to be thrown away, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of these books was "hard and good" after his death last year.
Paddington's book, which is described as "the most important in our family," adds that his father was very proud that he did well in the end.
"He was a very calm person, and was not a rude person," he said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you are proud of them even though you are not.
I think he had seen Paddington’s success in this way.
Despite his inventions and his ideas, he always accords his owner Paddington's honor.
My daughter was dying, and I had to text her on the phone
There he and his daughter rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur hospital, where doctors had worked at the risk of his life.
"Nad would call frequently to say that it was too expensive, and that he didn't expect to be healed," says Ednan-Lapehouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad that he would die within two minutes, and I had to have him arrested.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear one.
I will be with you in the near future.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to apply for heart transplants was slowly dehydrated from her body.
He had been dead for only a short time.
I had to wait and wait, knowing that everything was happening.
I cannot cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and others.
I had to keep them alone.
Afterward Ednan-Lapehouse, still grieving over the death of her daughter, she boarded an airplane with other non-conscious people.
"No one knows it," he said.
"My head was on the floor, and tears were falling all the time.
It is difficult to describe, but I felt sorry for Nad.
That he wanted me to love him and to understand him.
I knew where they liked me."
A grieving mother sends cards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two mothers who lost their family members in death attempted to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers.
Tyler, Brother Davis ’ son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear how I feel every day," he said.
A 45 - year - old woman named Davis, who lives in Lydney, commented that their son had the chance to become a good cook and to have a good sense of humor.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
His smile is always said to reflect everywhere.
However, she had left her job before she died, since she was in serious trouble.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, found his brother committed suicide.
She said: "I’m worried that there will be good results."
Sister Davis made the cards, "In order for people to know that there are people outside you and you can talk to them, even with a friend.
Don't just sit back and talk.'
Humpphreys, who had been a friend for many years to Mother Davies, lost her 15 - year - old husband, Mark, just after his mother died.
"She didn't say she felt sad or sad or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw a change.
It wasn't very good on Christmas Day when they opened their gifts without looking at them or saying anything.
He also said that his death was very frightening, but he had to endure in the following: "It left family members suffering very much.
They separate us.
But we all must endure.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain when the FBI begins his search
"I thought, if we found anything like what is asked for — such as a short search of time, a small one - we might be able to bring about a little unity," the Flake said on Saturday, adding that they feared the committee was a ‘ fall" during the hard political war.
Why did the Kavanaugh and the Republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is due to what was about to happen.
The middle decisions are up to five weeks to be made, on November 6 -ti, as expected, when members of the Republican party fail, they will be too weak to bring in the person who wishes to have him in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking the telephone to sing on the Internet, encouraging them to assist Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during the Bush, and by means of him, Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was their secretary.
What will happen if the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in Senate, with 51 votes for the Republican party and 49 members of the Democratic Party.
It is not known whether the Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate’s residence, which would allow Mike Pence, second of the president, to resolve the matter and assure him of the High Court.
The number of rebels has been "low" by Kim
The number of people from North Korea who have rebelled against South Korea has fallen since the reign of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer.
Park Bywaong-seug, speaking of much from the South Secretary's Office, said there were 1,127 more than 2,706 years ago in 2011.
Park said that the better management of the border between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers pay are due to this decline.
Pyonggang has never said anything about it.
Many rebels from North Korea are finally granted permission to become citizens of South Korea.
Seoul is said to have passed 30,000 North Koreans illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has a long border with North Korea and is much easier to cross than the DMZ Dimilitalized Zoo (DMZ).
Another sees these rebels as unauthorized nomads instead of fleeing their homes and is often forced to pay them back.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea — which has been at war — has changed dramatically in recent months.
Early this month, the two leaders met in Pyonging to discuss the previous nuclear communications devices.
This occurred after the special June conference between the U.S. President of a Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, while the two agreed to do the nuclear waste work in their Korean countries.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho’s Foreign Minister of North Korea said that discipline from the U.S.
"Unbelieved in the United States we will not be content with the security of our country and in these things it is impossible for us to stop using nuclear weapons alone," Ri said when speaking to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelousi calls Brett Kavanaugh," as unfit for serving at the High Court
The leader with a few member members of the union Nancy Pelosi is the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and said that he had no wisdom to work in the High Court.
The case is made in a speech on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't do anything but think that if a woman had done this, she would say, 'So then Pelos in giving her opinion of what Kavanaugh would say as a witness before the Fourth Senate Committee.
Kavanaugh refused the charges that he had raped Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were all young.
In her opening words, Kavanaugh was very upset, sometimes screaming and yelling at her family and her time in high school.
He also denounced members of the Democrats on the committee, claiming that his claims were "reverence and an attempt to make a name of the person" prepared by a freer to say that Hillary Clinton failed the 2016 vote.
The prosecutor claimed that the evidence in Kavanaugh proved that they should not work in the Supreme Court, since they had shown favor to the Democrats.
"I think they are losing their job by what they will say and how they speak to Clintons and Democrats," said.
The Pelousi was questioned when she was asked if she would try to remove the Kavanaugh in a vote if she was assured of the job, and if the Democrats have found many members in the Omera home.
"What I would say is - if he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress or the FBI, he is not qualified to be at the Supreme Court, but to be present, "So it was.
Kavanaugh is here with a judge at the DC CC Curcuit Court of Appeals.
The bridge added that if a member of the Democrat was concerned with decisions that Kavanaugh might disagree with Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, he is viewed as a Dutch lawyer for Democrat.
In his favorable response, the Kavanaugh refused to ask questions on whether he would change other decisions to the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an innocent person to go to court and expect us to say, 'This is not good,' "So said Pelos.
And women should take full advantage of this avenue.
By that righteous reproof, months and years of violent anger are coming to an end, and they will not be able to bring them out in empty space.
"We cry when we’re upset," Sister Steinim told me about it 45 years later.
"I don't think it’s strange, isn't it?"
He continued, "I was very helped by an older woman in the area who said she was upset, but made a plan to get angry and cry, she could say to the person who spoke to her, "You can think I’m sorry because I'm crying."
I'm angry."
And he continues.
And I think it was a good idea.
Tears are allowed to flow because tears are not fully understood.
One of my best memories of my first service was in the office with a number of men, where I once found myself crying and screaming in a fit of rage, was my arrest by an elderly manager with whom I always had a little fear - which brought me up to the stairs.
"Don't let these people see you cry," he told me to do so.
"Don't know that you’re upset.
She thinks you are sad and is happy that she has come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, formerly Democratic Congress in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in their presidential mission.
In 1987, after the Hart was caught committing adultery after he boarded the Monkey Businesss that led him to quit the race, Schroede, greatly disappointed, felt that there was no reason for him to search for an assignment in the race to compete for presidentship.
"He didn't choose correctly, "He told me and laughed at me 30 years later."
"There were already seven others who wanted to enter the race, and the last one was a person.
One of them called them "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was an automated campaign, he was behind the making of money, and he was determined that he could not enter the race unless he earned $2 million.
This was a failure.
It was found that some of the helpers who gave $1,000 to men should give him only $250.
"Do she think I accept an abortion?" she wondered.
When he announced that he did not have a definite campaign, he was deeply touched by the people who had helped him, disappointed by the arrangements that made it difficult to make money and plans to fight people who wanted to vote rather than vote, and angry by the lack of care and cause him to stop crying.
"If you thought I was in serious trouble," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media dealt with her.
"If you thought Klelex was a assistant to my company.
What do I remember about my gravestone?
"Did she cry"?"
Light on how China can benefit from the Cold War.
At the beginning of the conflict, the struggle between the two superpowers is still going hand in hand, but the superpowers who have been able to do so have been able to destroy the world’s resources.
The beginning of this was when the president of the United States, Donald Trump, set up taxes on goods from China as solar power equipment, various types of equipment, including nemenium.
The conflict seemed to reach its climax during the week when the American Union ordered 200 billion dollars ’ worth of property, or some 150 billion dollars ’ worth of it, to the United States.
China, in turn, has been returning the victim to the United States to pay taxes to punish the American country, recently established a 15 - percent tax rate, and these taxes have been costing 60 billion dollars ’ worth of property.
China has claimed to be paying back the abuse according to the U.S. influence and to be cautious about it.
In order for the United States to change its policy, it is necessary for Chinese products to be reduced to less expensive and attracters in the United States but for China to be openly absorbed by it, as they can bring reproach on the ruler of the country, Jinping.
However, some experts have suggested that it might be a long - term solution to China’s globalization, which could be achieved if the country did the right choice.
"Abgail Grace, of the Center for New America Security, also a leading Asian researcher, says that "multiple political factors have an impact on the economy in the United States and China as far as others think."
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
It is said that Syria was ready to return to her homeland and that she asked for help to rebuild a nation that had been destroyed during the war for over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al - Moulem said that things are getting better in the world.
"At present things are stable and safe because of what has been done in the fight against terrorism," said the U.S.
The government continues to restore what has been lost in order to restore values.
All things have now become more stable for refugees to come to a land where they must leave because of the terrorist attacks and economic developments that have affected their daily lives and their behavior.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syriac people have been displaced since the 2011 war.
Six million others in the country still need help.
Al-Moulem claimed that the Syrian government would receive help in rebuilding this devastated land.
But he insisted that it could not receive help with other needs or assistance from the countries that had helped the terrorists.
A European team has earned a fridge of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has taken the Ruder Cup cup of the year 2018 after winning the USA team 16 and a half of the 10-pounders of Le Gold National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. nation has been surrendering to the Rhyder Cup series of six years that have been played in Europe, and it has never been held since 1993.
An international team, led by Thomas Bjorn, seized the cup again and again after it gained 14.5 awards to conquer the U.S. team.
The U.S. team expert Phil Mickelson, who refused to show off the race, had thrown the ball into a ball so badly that his enemy Francesco Molinari could find a tower over them.
The players from Italy played in all of these games and made him 1 of the 4 players who had held 5-0 since the game in 1979.
American athletes, Jordan Spieth sadaolte when he gave the 5.4 votes to a European team of Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who did not reach the real skills.
The world’s most famous athlete, Dustin Johnson, fell from Ian Poulter of England, probably his last toy in the Ryder Cup cup.
The Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergiio Garcia, has been the most successful athlete in Europe and a quarter of 255.
"I'm not right to cry, but I can't do it today.
That was a very difficult year.
I am grateful to my teacher Thomas for believing me.
I am so happy, happy to have received this cup again.
The objective was for our team to win., and I am glad I have had a share in this victory," said Garcia, who seems very popular in following the successes of his European team.
He thanked John Ram's fellow citizens who had won US Tiger Woods 2&1 for each Sunday game.
"I’m too proud to beat the Tiger Woods, where I grow up and watch him playing," said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods had won all four games in France and is now successful in the Ruder Cup race that has reached 13-2-3.
This is disturbing in view that this is one of the world's greatest achievements, which have won 14 competitions and was won by Jack Nicklaus alone.
The USA had struggled at the end of the week to achieve good results except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who had played the top soccer team.
The U.S. president of Jim Furryk spoke after he had played a disturbing game in his team, "I’m proud of the boys, he works hardly.
There was a time in the morning when we had trouble with the European team.
We fought a hard fight.
All the credit goes to Thomas.
It is a fine lead.
All 12 of them are running successfully.
We will be able to make more adjustments, and we will be able to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee.
I love all 12 of them, and I am proud to be their leader.
We can say that you are doing well.
We will agree that our friends played better than we did.
Several Red Seas: Reduce in size in Pinellas, Manatete, and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida National Institute of Fish and Wildlife in Florida shows a dramatic decrease in the Red Tide in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, red tides are located in the Pinellas, Manette, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The eruption of the Red Sea extends about 130 miles [130 km] of coastlines from the north of the Pinellas to the south of Lee.

Red waves were also seen in Pasco County.
The growth in the center of the Pinellas County was reported last week, a small and great increase on the Hillsborough County, the nearest and large size of the Manatee County, the nearest and larger area of Sarasota County, the smaller and near Charlotte County, the nearest and greater north of Lee County, and the smaller growth in the Congoer County.
Restlessness continues to be reported in the towns of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
The respiratory problem is not mentioned in Northwest Florida for the second week.
