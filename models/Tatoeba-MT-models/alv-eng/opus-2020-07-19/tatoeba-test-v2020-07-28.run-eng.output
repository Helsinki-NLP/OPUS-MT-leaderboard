You have to get it.
Why at home?
Asa and my father.
Do not hold back.
I am a new person here.
I’m not sure.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what these people have to say.
Why don’t we go there together?
What a reunion that will be!
Awake!
I’m homeless.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I know exactly how I felt about her.
You are a good person.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Better yet, why not try to replace it with something more?
I am not hungry.
I am a good student.
I threw away my keys.
We were not alone.
I want you to know that.
May I ask, What good can you get out of this relationship?
No one knew what to do.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why don’t you learn French?
Not necessarily.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When does it occur?
Do you know why?
When am I approaching you?
We don’t have any money.
Forgive me!
I do not need them.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
It is very good.
Not only did it begin to fade but it also began to fade.
I lost my pen.
When do you get up?
You can pick any color that is comfortable.
She prepared all the flour.
They don’t have any money.
You are a good parent.
Come or us?
I want to do so.
Do you want to be rich?
I no longer have a head.
If you do not hear, they will come.
He is my father.
That’s what I want to know.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he comes.
I can’t believe it.
He was said to be very rich.
His Word was truly wonderful.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows him well except his parents.
I was able to do that.
I don’t think he comes.
He was cut off.
The sun is setting on the east.
Why not?
It will be very good.
No problem.
I remember that first.
Do you want to take them with you?
And what is that name?
You avoid me because I have spoken it.
My brother was not at home.
My parents invited me to stay with them.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
Now look at the picture.
I’m in a car.
What can you do?
Is this your mother?
Why does the sky look blue?
If you don’t, come.
It’s our car.
Nobody here has a car.
Choose for Us!
I don’t know the word.
Light.
I’m glad you exist.
Are you looking for us?
Not at all!
Of what value is that?
I don’t have any privileges.
My daughter will be married in sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you are saying.
It makes me happy.
Where do you know my name?
Do you want to?
Love — Is It Out of Control?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, 12-year.
I have a question.
I learned that you are married.
Are you going?
In the past, he was a teacher.
You got it.
I was stunned!
Whom do you think I am?
So have I.
You want to find out.
The flag is a border.
I don’t live with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want to drink something?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
I think it’s your grief.
Take a taxi to find it in a hotel.
Would you not agree?
He is coming!
The answer is obvious.
I do not know how long the delay will continue.
Whose image is this?
Back home?
Keep at it!
Nobody knows what to do.
Do not look at the material below.
I’ll ask him.
We returned.
I’ll see you.
I know a lot about you.
No problem.
I want to learn French.
My car broke down.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is happening.
He left the key to his car.
Why are you not at home?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate sheep from goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I’m going to send you to school.
Do I Know Tom?
Does that prospect appeal to you?
May I come back?
That is why I love you.
Are you one?
The temperature soared, and soon the heat became almost unbearable.
Please give me a copy.
It is toward the outside world.
It is too hot.
You know I love you.
The bed is hot and humid.
The answer has to do with time.
I took the money.
What do you want to see?
How Do You Go to School?
Are you a new person?
I know what needs to be done.
Do you enjoy studying?
Do you have any money?
I don’t know how.
I know what that means.
What are these shoes?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is beautiful.
Thanks to our house.
I respect her.
Not at all!
She is strong.
This is $2.50.
I returned home to my mother.
They are perfect.
Your safety is at stake.
“ I hurt you.
Thank you very quickly.
Do you enjoy studying?
I will give you.
Let us eat and drink.
I want the same things myself.
You are my friend.
What is our car?
Nobody knows what to do.
Which school do you attend?
You definitely want to know about it!
He is a good student.
He gives me time to meditate.
Receive a copy of the book.
I have no home.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I thought.
They are happy.
I became very hungry.
You don’t know.
Do not look at that.
I wish you were home.
My daughter will be walking hand in hand.
He was raised by his grandmother.
He did.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my sister.
The robe was engraved on my men’s shoulders.
How long do you want to keep it?
I leave home about two o'clock in the morning.
I lost my sight as a result of that accident.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We can understand.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are a woman I love.
I’ll be happy with you.
It is ours.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Do not say the same things over and over again.
Now I’m going to send it back to you.
Where are we going?
I don’t understand why.
You know where I am.
What Is the Purpose of Your trip?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
Stop the car.
I am not good enough.
Do you know what to do?
We know.
No, thank you.
Where do you want to be?
I love the place I live in.
Do not ask yourself.
Do I need to open a window?
A few yards of rain.
Where are you going?
You look good, even if you can.
You have to go home.
Is he here?
Are you learning French?
You will learn to do so very much.
Visit me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know how.
There I met my brother.
I know what I am doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I do the same for you.
This girl dresses like a son.
I do not have my brother.
Sadly, my older friend moved to another city.
Your father?
You know I must go.
It is your book.
It is not my day.
How long does he continue to suffer from an illness?
If he had continued home that day, there would have been no chance.
He spoke not only English but also German.
I am not happy.
I know what is happening.
I know.
Best, No.
I know what you think.
He is jealous.
It was not enough that I had to change it.
Better yet, why not try to replace it with something more?
This girl dresses like a son.
I like to watch you clean and tidy.
I have to cut my hair.
Lesser ones?
My owner is my brother.
I’m glad you are.
Do you have time to help me?
Leave him alone.
I don’t know how to give names.
Do you know what love is?
There will be Saturday.
I did not want to die.
Tell me what you want.
What is the source of this new book?
I lost my pen.
Thank you for coming.
I am a baker.
There is a man standing behind the wall.
I went to school.
Be realistic.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
Are you a good worker?
When I climbed up the slope, I could hardly believe my eyes.
Is that true?
We did.
But they are children.
How Can You Help a “Prodigal ” Child?
Do not forget to take a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a way out.
Here I go to school too.
I don’t have my sister.
I leaned toward my bow.
What do you see?
Shyness.
Do you know where he is?
Where is your father?
Do not call me over again.
My father is at home.
Shaving has an on - again, off - again approach.
Are they Japanese?
Give me a copy.
You are a good person.
The windows are heading south.
I can’t buy my bread.
I will go in the day of God.
We can see it.
Where do you come from?
We are here.
I don’t know where he lives.
There are about a hundred people in a room.
I understand that.
The gum line has no teeth.
Not really.
My dream has come true.
You can understand.
I am not sure what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I am not a graduate of the university.
Let me see.
Are you ours?
Provide fine things in the sight of those who hate you.
Since there is no one else, they must be different.
They are too small.
The stork does not appear to work today.
We are so happy.
She was strikingly beautiful.
Please visit me.
I’m not a perfect carpenter.
You don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I wish you were home.
I did it for you.
I love your vehicle.
Who is your teacher?
Will you go home?
Does it warm your heart?
It is worth the effort.
Undoubtedly.
Was I successful?
I’m not sure.
I’m glad you are there.
I need to feel that I need to be treated that way.
Let’s give it up.
Do not be judgmental, and you may have to draw the wrong conclusion.
I am not sure what to think about.
I don’t know what to do.
What accounts for this?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
The money ran out.
I want to buy a car.
I want to leave too.
It seems very doubtful.
How do you measure up in this regard?
We laughed.
Not at all!
I threw away my keys.
I do not understand this word.
I don’t care if you live today.
I am looking for you.
You see, this is my house.
I love your vehicle.
He was said to be very rich.
No one can be certain.
Walk or not?
We don’t.
There was a temple in ancient times.
I know you said that.
Oh, no.
Why not go home?
Do you feel the same way?
I don’t have any privileges.
What do you want to see?
Why do you ask?
He is coming!
I don’t have a happy day.
I am sure he is superior to me.
Receive in the right way.
I know that girl.
They did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your homework.
I want to accompany you.
I know only his name.
Asa and his mother.
You will be glad you did.
We can understand that.
What is the family like?
My native language is Spanish.
Keep in Step!
How old is he?
I need to know why.
You are not my sister.
My family is relatively small.
Do you know why?
Is she home?
I love mathematics.
I know what to do.
Since there is no one else, they must be different.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
Not at all!
Where was Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where do you find it?
My French is not what I know.
When do you go?
They don’t have any money.
Tell them what happened.
Is the phone number correct?
Be firm.
It is not French.
Look at me!
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
They could see him.
Does It Need All Travel?
I don’t care if you live today.
He nodded.
Are you ours?
It is not presumptuous.
Going up!
I love this vehicle.
I know where I am going.
Yours is similar to yours.
How much is paid?
It is simply gone.
Not at all!
Where do you want to be?
Keep your eyes open.
Nobody listens to me.
Do not forget to take a letter.
We are here on your own.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
“ Take your shoes off.
They know us.
When do you get up?
I will not give up.
From Britain.
You avoid me because I have spoken it.
Don’t worry about it.
The windows are open.
You do not have to come.
No one listened.
I have never forgotten this experience.
I don’t think he comes.
No problem.
A rice is baked on the ground.
I know how it works.
No one asked.
They want us to do so.
What do you see outside?
I thought you would like that.
I shall not be there.
Where was Tom?
Is this French?
The source of these books is my sister.
We can go to work from one day at a time to the next.
We got there.
I am learning French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they are.
It is a wonderful book.
Our arms are outstretched.
I know your father.
I learned French at school.
You have to go home.
Where have all the people gone?
Can you open a window?
Will you go somewhere that summer?
Where is my mother?
If not, when?
Is that what you are looking for?
Where Is Your Car?
My father was not at home.
There is no question about that.
Do you know?
He is equal to all that he expects of us.
Are you looking for them?
No wealthy people live here.
The tip had to be sharp.
A nurse.
I would like to see her.
My father was not at home.
Not at all!
What’s a cell phone?
You can sing a song.
Forgive me, for I am so sorry.
I know what that means.
We are jealous.
Let me assure you that it is.
Where are we going?
Love is blind.
Let me explain.
I know you have.
I am not a student.
I’ll try.
The strong winds are blowing, and I am unable to move quickly.
Probably not.
There I met my sister.
I do not give up.
How much time will you spend?
Asa and his father.
What is that?
You have been given a copy.
My house is next to the local place of worship.
He was betrayed!
All the apples that fall to the ground will be eaten by pigs.
I couldn’t look.
I don’t want to read them.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where Do You Go to School?
What is it?
What a thought!
He gave it to me.
I never saw him.
What is he like?
We are listening.
Why do people say that?
The map is of great value.
I have sworn by mistake.
I do not understand French.
Not one!
Why do I have to do this?
It is Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a baker.
How many?
We don’t have any money.
I know you are listening.
Bring your shoes out of there.
I know what you look like.
I was happy.
Is this the new car?
Why don’t you go in?
He did not read the book.
I don’t want to be rich.
You are sorry if I said it.
The animal has no teeth.
That will be joyful.
You can go.
When do you come home?
He did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is by no means new.
A nurse.
She is a French.
I don’t have a car.
Pay attention to your head.
Why not keep your thoughts clearly in mind?
I want you to see him.
You can use this vehicle.
I’m not sure.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Stop saying that!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought two eggs and a few milk.
One copy was missing.
I saw her again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was that purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I will be in my car.
I don’t like running.
She is a French.
He is a tall son.
I know exactly how they feel.
You know exactly how to do it.
I have a car.
When will you come to your home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 7: 00 p.m. is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You need to stop drinking.
Be behave toward your mother.
There is a way out.
Where did you stop the car?
I am at between one and two hours.
If you have freeness of speech, stop yourself.
What shall I wear?
What Is a Book?
The Americans?
What do they look like?
Look at me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not necessarily.
Will we meet them?
What About You?
An Idea?
Drink.
He is coming!
Would you like to examine that topic?
I will step on such.
We are joyful.
Keep it tidy and clean.
It makes me feel sick.
I take them.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not necessarily.
I learned French at school.
Why the liver?
I want you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Are you looking for me?
Put it down your mother.
You know I must go.
Which car?
Do you love him?
We have to place the balance between exits and logins.
The serpent struck home.
They do not have a modern - day view.
Do you know what to ask yourself?
Open the window!
It’s our turn!
This son is brother to you.
Why not go to school?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I get in?
You know I love you.
Researchers have found the bones of a man in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see them again?
These measures can help to prevent the spread of disease.
I’m a factor.
We were told to eat a meal in the afternoon.
Do not be angry!
It is not a matter of conversation. We will go to a movie.
I fell in love with him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am a new person here.
I want to learn French.
I’m going to find you.
I do not have my sister.
I sleep a lot.
I have a briefcase.
The water is clear.
If I knew, I would go.
I express what I think.
What Is the Price?
I know where we are.
Why Did They Not Come?
I’m going to get my car home.
Why not attend a school?
We are students at a university.
I don’t know his name.
I cannot believe my eyes.
How Do You Go to School?
Forgive me!
Keep it up.
Of course not!
Do you know what it is?
You are sorry if I said it.
I know his family.
I know what that is.
I threw away my keys.
This is what I do.
I don’t have any privileges.
What Is the Purpose of Your trip?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
The next day, I was pregnant.
Yes, it does?
We know him.
I need some rest.
No one asked.
We are jealous.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I get up at 4: 00 a.m.
Do not open the window.
Family history.
Why not?
Why the hot?
Unless it is raining, she goes to work each day.
It is ours.
Do not look under these circumstances.
How does your brother feel?
Can We Talk?
Where have you taken us?
I loved this vehicle.
Why do you learn French?
I think so.
I’ve found them!
I know who you are, and I can tell you.
He accused the man of stealing.
I carried this tape recorder.
I can’t believe my ears.
I don’t know their names.
I am fully on your side.
I know what to do.
He was said to be very rich.
Your safety is at stake.
Don’t you agree?
Do you like it?
"What's this's more common?"" "The player is the Father."
You do not have to thank me.
What happened next evening?
We would like you to take it with us.
Asa and his mother.
As individuals, we have the joy of being such.
We called on you.
Do you want to?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want to drink something?
You do not know at all what happened, or do you know?
I know what love is.
Not one.
The reaper rises from the stalks and leaves.
What do you do here?
I’m a factor.
No one is ever prepared for me.
We were in one school.
When?
It made me think.
Do you have any rice?
Is he here?
We meet them.
We are brothers and sisters.
I know why you are here.
Why do you study at a university?
What is he like?
Sooner or later, you will be confronted with the reality of those words.
When will you come home?
I have failed.
Take pride in learning to do things well.
Listen to your mother!
Read on.
I will give you.
What are the facts?
They are in my room.
Is the tea strange?
Do you want to drink something?
I am the youngest.
How much is paid?
I would like to read this book.
From Brazil.
I am coming to you with me.
We were in one school.
Do not forget us!
I am writing to us.
Do not give in to peer pressure.
Do you have this money?
They are too small.
It is his work.
That is what you asked for.
She’s my sister.
What are you looking for?
Shopping?
He was cut off.
I want to see it.
Stop giving orders here!
Sometimes we go to the cinema together.
Would you not agree?
What did you read?
Where are we going?
Why do we do it?
This is extremely long.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There is an empty space where before there was a living human.
She’s my sister.
It is his work.
Do you know what they said?
I do not understand it.
They don’t know anything.
Is he an American?
A coffee or a tea?
What is going on in the south?
I’m sorry I did leave you in the garden.
We are all alone.
I love what I do.
My voice just going out in public.
Do you know what it was?
His Word was always.
When are you about to leave?
I don't understand that.
Is that the best thing to do?
Are they also in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing a lot of time.
Why do you not give up?
Make a fitting presentation without being distracted by other languages.
What is his family like?
Magdalena and Anita are best friends.
I’m glad you are.
We should eat supper together.
Consider one example.
Do you have a sibling?
We got together.
I’ll agree with that.
I’ve to think about it.
Where is Mary?
I have serious health problems.
I must continue.
I’m glad you exist.
Can you imagine your joy?
Why don’t you go too?
Nobody is at home.
Let me explain.
He came to love her.
She did not get pregnant.
Why Don’t They Like Me?
How much is left?
What did you give me?
Go out.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
His face was red with anger.
Not really.
Stork!
I’ll take part.
How many nights?
We shall succeed.
I was greeted by people with warm, friendly smiling faces.
You have to go home.
Asa and his father.
You are told to take me along.
Do you know where he is?
I was not happy.
Why don’t you go too?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
This package is a fine one.
I wish you were home.
I don’t have my sister.
I don’t know.
I don’t know my names.
Can You Recall?
I grieve.
Do you know who these people are?
Is this right too expensive?
Why do I do it?
I’m not sure.
This industry produces motorized vehicles.
I am not a student.
We can only guess.
Do not do that again.
Look in the window.
I was not happy.
One copy was missing.
He keeps money in its place.
They are happy.
Riding in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Do you want to find it?
Remember, you are being willing to put your own interests ahead of your own.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We love to give talks in the language of the people every day.
So why did you come here?
I do not understand it.
I went to study.
No one spoke.
We are brothers and sisters.
It is too hot.
So I did that.
I have to study.
Thank you very much!
It matters to him.
Does that prospect appeal to you?
You're our sister.
What was that purpose?
I have no goals for any other way anymore.
We are students at a university.
There is nothing new.
Are you sure you want to do so?
Can’t you enlarge on that?
No one saw it.
I’ll try.
I would like to ask you, Are you a failure?
I know that girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where have you been?
No problem.
I love to.
How many cups did you drink?
What is the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
The car is a luxury luxury.
We don’t.
Our arms were outstretched.
We shall find them.
Your stories?
I know you have.
I’m sorry to reprimand you.
Children.
I am a teacher.
We got on the edge of a cliff.
Name has been changed.
Do you want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I don’t salute the flag.
I am a student at the university.
These publications are for us.
They do not want us to know that.
It’s not my car.
You received a sign of the red light.
I know what I’m assigned to learn.
I love you very much.
I understand that.
I want you to come home.
We’re all going together.
Give the chance.
I am not strong.
Not one!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do You Understand French?
He gives me time to think.
It is toward the outside world.
What is the wine?
I have my sister.
It does not keep account of the injury.
When you need help, you invite me.
So did I.
We left.
They are not rich here.
Why does he want to happen?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is coming!
We go there together.
We’ll do that again in the coming week.
I like to watch how you prepare.
What do you do?
I am the creature.
Do they too come?
He knows that we love him.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
Nobody listens to me.
I love to learn French.
Perhaps we can take along the coast this weekend.
Why?
Would you not agree?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I know you.
Would you like to examine that topic?
There is no joy in this game.
I know where I am going.
All day long she goes to work, except for the rain.
Thank you very much!
I do not want to give up.
What is going on in the south?
I’ll see the game.
They look good.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who the car is?
I am the creature.
You are a good student.
Keep that in mind.
I know I really met her at another time.
Do You Have a Waiting Attitude?
