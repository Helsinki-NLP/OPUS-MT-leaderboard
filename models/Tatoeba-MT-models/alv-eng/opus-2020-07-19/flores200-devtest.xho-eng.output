Car travel is a study of each driver’s movements and vehicles from one place to another and the way they deal with each other.
Unfortunately, learning how to drive traffic is difficult because the driver’s voice is almost impossible.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave well within the correct line; however, the roads tend to have the right flexibility and can be counted.
If you are a better driver for traffic, the relationship is established between three key qualities: (1) walking, (2) pressure, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps plan, design, and work.
