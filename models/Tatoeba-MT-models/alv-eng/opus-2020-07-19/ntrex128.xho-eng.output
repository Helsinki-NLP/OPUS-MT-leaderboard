Welsh Assembly (AMs) is concerned about looking foolish
There are Ams concerned because it is raised to change the way they are called MWPs (A member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has been done because there are plans to change the name of the convention to be held in Wales.
The AMs in all politics is concerned that this will increase them.
One Lambur AM is concerned that his group is concerned that the new name comes close to the way it is called "Twp" and "Pwp."
To a student who is not living in Wales: Welsh wtp means a fool and prap means an adze.
The AM of the Wales Organization has said that the whole community does not like this, and it has recommended other names.
A member of the Conservative Society in Wales says that his group has no problem with the change of name, but has found it easy to call MWP by the way he calls a fool.
In this case the way the letter w is pronounced in Welsh is similar to the way the letter is pronounced in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is involved in compiling the law of the change of name into this new name, said: "The decision of how to call members of the Assembly shall be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh convention permission to change its name.
By June, the Commission has published the results of the public’s responses and has found that many support for the convention’s change of name as Parliament of Wales.
In the matter of how to call Ams, the Commission prefers members of the Wales Parliament or WMPs, but the people support the MWP.
AMs is said to offer alternative advice, but the fact that it is difficult to agree on this matter must be a problem for Elin Jones, the Chief Minister, who is expected to make a law change in the following weeks.
The order of change will include some adjustments, such as the operation of the convention, including the ban on AMs and the makeup of the committee.
The AMs votes will finally count when the law is discussed in the question of how to be called.
The Macedonians will urge you to change the name of their country
The voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name into "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The voter is designed to resolve a conflict that has lasted for decades with the neighboring country of Greece called Macedonia.
The Athenians have long claimed that the names of their neighbors in the north have become a matter of controversy in their area, and they have long challenged their request to be members of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to this change of name, says that he will not ignore the vote.
However, the sponsors of the vote, including President Zoran Zaev, say that this change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin Not Steels Hard as Churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The older people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them."
He said he understood why there were no barleys.
He said: "People will be having fun in another way" these days.
"Ibar is not a place to live in the neighborhood where people go regularly."
He is concerned about the churches because he believes that the money he earns from selling his goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to the condition he originally had."
In addition, churches can be replaced by man - made blocks that will never help to keep the remaining shrines of the community.
He said: "Many people who buy these cards are white people. So the days will soon come when the churches will be closed, because these moveers don't seem to be members of these churches."
Both of these churches were white congregations before Harlem became a place of black people, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist congregation was formed in the 1930 ’ s.
The dark congregation that had served close to that one had been built.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Black. John Howard Johnson, who led the merchant to 125th Street, the best - selling street in Harlem, opposed to unemployment and not to the support of black people.
In 1893 the building was severely damaged by fire, but as the members of the Tat' Johnsons were preparing to rebuild it, they were ordered to strike iron.
The bull. David Johnson, son and successor to the Tat Johnson's in St. Martin's, called it "babys."
The man who was skillful in metal beating, and who struck them, called it "The treasures of culture" and "It's a tool of history that will never be replaced."
This scholar, Tiffany N Ng, of the University of Michigan, also said that the first time this instrument was played by black musician Dionyo A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church to a large number of bells 18 years ago.
Mr. Merweather said St. Martin's had not replaced another person.
The main thing here in St. Martin's was in the past few months were artisans and architects, some of whom were called non-priests, others the Labe church.
A civil - administrative body, composed of non - religious leaders, wrote a letter to the judge in July concerned that the discreet man may be responsible for the congregation, although he did not play a role in the employment of architects and architects who were sent by the project.
Some members complain that the sages do not count things.
Chebe affects a child with 13-year drink to get lobsters in California
The police, the shark has attacked and affected 13 - year - old boy on Saturday, when he was drinking to catch a lobster in California on the day it was opened at the time of the clock.
This attack occurred just before 7 a morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. Then they went to him to help him pull it out of the water.
At first, I thought he was happy to hold thelobster, but later he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I’m circumcised! ’
‘ I'm deleted!'
This lower part of the neck above the chest is full, and Hammel is aware of this when he comes to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'
The boy is driven by plane to the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in serious condition.
It is not known which type of sharks are left.
Seagull Captain Captain Captain. Larry Giles said when talking to the reporter, sharks have been seen there for weeks, but it was said that they are not a dangerous type of shark.
Miles adds that the victim has been seriously injured in the upper body.
The officers had shut off the sea from the Ponto Beach in Casabbad to Swami's Ejanitas for 48 hours to ensure safety.
Gilles says that there are more than 235 species of sharks in the area, but most are said to be safe.
Sainsbury's plan to bring its products to the UK salt market
Sainsbury's competes with Byts, Superrdrug and Dbeenhams by having stores equipped with special goods to help people.
As an important means of entering the UK’s oil market that keeps up to £2.8bn, while fashion and household sales are low, the main packages will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and will be available in more stores the next year if they run well.
Borrowing money from cosmetics has been created because these stores want to use empty shelves after being charged with TV, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's will double the outputs you have to have reached 3,000, including names like Revlon, Essie, Thezerman, and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Those who already have L'Orel, Maabelline and Burt's Bees will have more space to place them in places with names like those for stores such as Bys.
The store will also publish Boutic products for many of the people who do not eat meat that the new customers demand.
Also, the perfume seller Fraser Shop will test the requirements for two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, the last week and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the year.
The use of the Internet and the fact that people buy small meals a day at a nearby store requires that larger stores do more to encourage people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of the Sainsbury's department, said that these stores will look like large stores with different products, as they try to fight stores with such expensive costs as Aldi and Lidl with more services and other non-food items.
Sainsbury's place places where you can buy Argos in many stores and have started with the Habitats because they bought both for the past two years. This has increased the purchase of food and made them profitable.
Efforts to improve the oil and medicine department have been unsuccessful.
Her Sainsbury's tried to contact the yets at the beginning of the 2000, but they broke up after fighting in a way that would divide the store profits in its stores.
This new strategy occurs after Sainsbury's sold Celesio, the owner of the Lyys Phharmacy’s drug market for 281 stores for £125m, over the past three years.
It says that Lloyds will also share in this plan, by increasing the high - quality printing productions that include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief of commerce at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of our packages to improve our customers.
We have raised money to those with specialized training so that they can share it with us.
The various products we have are designed to be suitable for each piece of food, which makes a person look for the place where it is readily available, is now a fascinating and unique place of cosmetics and that is not the same as the old purchase method.
Peter Jones is angry because Holly Willoughby has stopped business £114 million
Peter Jones, well - known in the Dragons Den, went away 'with anger' after Prosthetic Dr. Holly Willoughby stopped the trade of £11million of the life - style product in order to cope well with the new agreements he has had with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their production of household products and decorations such as Truly.
This second business was likened to the Gwyneyth Passrow's Goop product.

Holly Willoughby has left a reputation in Dragons "Den, Peter Jones is angry because he has gone out the last minute on the life - style market - so that he can handle his new findings well with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was angry when an important TV girl admitted to a hot meeting on Tuesday at her trading capital at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements - up to £1.5 million - does not allow her enough time to take care of household products such as Truly.
This business is compared with the Gwyneth Passrow's Goop product and had received double the Willoughby's allowance estimated at £11 million.
As Willoughby, the 37th, put in Instagram to leave Truly, Jones went to one of his homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly has been the most important thing to Holly.
It is his long - awaited future, through no more than a decade.
The decision to leave her is a surprise to everyone.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, near the time of the commemoration.
There is a shopping mall at Marlow HQ.
Experts think that the departure of a representative of the This Morning, who is among the most profitable in Britain, may cost the company millions of company from large sums of fuel and candles to furniture and furniture, and things that may be more disturbing to its development.
And this could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go together for a holiday, and Jones has 40 percent assignments in the Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby will be the representative of this M&S flag and will replace Ant McPartlin as the conducting of the ITV system I'm A Celebriity.
A source near Jones has long said, "We will not talk about his business affairs."
We said ‘ love one another. ’
He laughed at the criticism of the press by saying what some consider to be a ‘ incompetent ’ and speaking well of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said in his embarrassing tone of "I’m a radio reporter."
"I didn't sacrifice anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting again after her first meeting in Singapore in June that was introduced by Trump as a major step in the nuclear process in North Korea.
But the Cold War has come to an end.
More than three months after the June conference in Singapore, North Korean executive Ring Ho told world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the Northern Assembly of the Law, which says North see no ‘ the same answer ’ from the United States to North Korea for anti-armourage action.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its focus on oppression.
Trump has given hope in the speech he gave him at his wedding.
"We're doing well with North Korea," said.
We fought with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very close relationship.
He says that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim and produce far - reaching effects on the guns, resulting in the release of the hostages and the restoration of the American military bones.
And he has protected her from a strange way of communicating with Kim.
"It is very easy to become presidents, rather than 10,000 outside people who try to enter this full stadium would have about 200 people standing here," Trum said that he pointed to a crowd standing right before him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and Nikama, destroying the island, killing hundreds of people
After the quake in Lombok, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they did not need.
Even if 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had been removed from the area, the area was not declared as a disaster area, which would result in world aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not ask the world to help them, so this is a challenge," says Mszn Sumung.
While the River the Children is gathering a group to go to Palu, there is still uncertainty about whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian officials are examining the situation of Palu to see if the world’s institutions would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that often reach Indonesia, the country is not always equipped with a dramatic earthquake.
While tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they have rarely been built on the coast.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, though warned, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the relatively quiet times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel increasingly difficult.
A hospital vessel from Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes will go to Palu, but it will take at least three days before reaching the new disaster site.
President Joko Widondon set the goal of improving the foundations of the decline in Indonesia when casting out elections, and he has spent a lot of money in repairing roads and railroads.
But lack of financial support has overwhelmed Mr.
On the other hand, Mr. Joko is faced with the pressure of ethnic strife in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have entered the largest part of the service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds are forced to leave their homes as groups of Christians and Muslims fight in the streets using knives, guns, and other weapons.

Cromwell’s statue is the last to be found in the debate about “the re - creation of history. ”
Its removal will be the righteousness of the universe because of its destruction similar to that of Tabiban in the vast majority of English folk and religious images practiced by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell described Mr Crick's advice as foolish "and try to write history again."
“ John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would be inevitable that this conversation is present with the removal of images that the statue of the Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be a target.
The destruction of images in the English wars was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Cromwell will probably be provided for by means of the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the past century.
The excellent way Sir William Hamo Thornecroft described in Cromwell is evidence of 19th - century views and part of the history of many who still believe that his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, probably more than at the end of the 19th century, as the defender of Parliament against outside pressure, particularly in his case of oppression from the empire.
Whether this method is accurate depends on a continuing history debate.
There is no doubt that the conflicts that existed in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on our next world development, and Cromwell is a man who has identified one side of the conflict.
What they accomplish as the Lord of Defense must be celebrated and remembered.
A Deadly Rat and a Chinese Pandemic Killing
A farmer has been attacked by swine in a market in southwestern China, according to local news.
A man, described only by his surname "Yuan," was found to have a broken vein, covered with blood near a herd pack in Kuuphanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.

Yuan’s family and business authorities are said to talk about the payment of his death.
Although rarely, the situation where pigs are exposed is more likely to attack humans than ever before.
In 2016, a cockroach and her husband attacked their farm in Massachusetts, a man of serious injury.
In the last ten years, 650 weighted a Welsh farmer in telekhthar until his wife expelled the hen.
After the Oregon farmer was fed by his pigs in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told the CBCs that the pigs did not feel angry but their bloodletting can make them so.
It will be just a game.
They are nails, they are too big... for the purpose of harming them.

He had many warriors.
The gang leader Halket had a body, which consisted of a super-decorating concrete, while Menga kept up the Canor Goldson and Joe Worral in their lives all the time.
The Ringers needed encouragement.
Despite having had a good time at some point under Gerard, they have fallen to the tops of the deck.
Their last ball was only one in which they had created a home rapide, and that was a trigger for Ringers, which they found at the center of the table.

Mexico's AMO promised that she would not serve the troops in the community
The Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use civilian security forces as the country comes to the 50th anniversary of the injury and non-recompliance of students.
Lopez Obrador has promised on Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza that "he will never use armies to suppress Mexicans."
The forces started shooting in the exhibition of the commandive order on October 2, 1968, killed 300 people during the period of the student movement in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youths by providing monthly and monthly support for students and opening up a number of open universities for society.
He noted that lack of employment and a lack of opportunities for education lead to youth involvement with gangs of criminals.
The U.S. has doubled the A.I currency.
China has become more active at the Non-compliance Center, U.S., to double the time it spends in the research field, that is, the financial client and the AI programteer Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These commissions come after various parts of the U.S. government make declarations of the AI, as well as the U.S.
In the meantime, China announced its plan this past year: it had set the goal of No.1 on AI design in 2030.
"Repetition of an AI scan will be a good start, as all other countries are behind the U.S., and we look at the next type of AI," says Lee.
Repetition can repeat the next major success of AI that will be done in the U.S., says Lee in interviews with CNNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO for the Sinotion Ventures, sponsoring one of the largest AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI program that struck the highest person in the world Othelo pyer, who was the director of the Microsoft Action later, and who was then president of the Google branch of China.

U.S. researchers must work hard to achieve government financial support, reports Lee.
"It's not China to take the leads of education; it's the joint parties," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technologies have hired experienced university workers to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change of travel police may help to support their II efforts

The Council of the State of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Non-Financies of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Institute of Nature provides support for students in the same educational institutions as does the National Institute of Nature and other government institutions that contribute money to the U.S. researchers, but to a degree less than in China, reports Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Defense Department established the United Kingdom Office for non-compatriots, which was intended to involve cooperative groups from industry to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the election of the Consolidation Committee.
And this month the DARPA announced a $2 billion savings as the beginning of a test called AI Follower.
As SS, she now has more than $100 million savings a year and is prepared for research on AI.

The Macedonians have voted on the desendum to change the name of their country.
The Macedonians have voted on the desendum on Sunday to change the country's name into "Northern Republic of Macedonia," an action that has solved the age - old dispute and broken members to call prices in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, requires that her neighboring North be represented by an appeal to her place and close the entrance to NATO and the EU.

President Gjorge Ivanov points out that he will not vote for refendum and that commanding to work together is not sure that the voters can meet the requirements of a minimum 50% required to carry out the approved choice of referunum.
The question in the draft board of the refeefundum reads: "May you be a member of the NATO and EU party who accepted an agreement with Greece."
Advocates of the word change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price paid is due to be accepted on such sites as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that will meet in the former Yugoslavia.
"I will come here today to vote for the future of this world, making new people here in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, for that will mean a safe life for all of us, says Olivera Georgijjeska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, members of the parliament claim that they will lend themselves to the outcome of the vote so that they can be won.[2]
The change of the name will require a second-third of the parliament.

The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted dedensum in Macedonia for a change of name to open the way for joining NATO and European Union in Strucica, Macedonia in September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, with 54, set up a small platform and pushed himself ahead of the tent seats which were set up by antiferundum.
"We may have both the NATO and the EU, but we want to actively join, not according to door services" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept it as Macedonia, we can turn such countries as China and Russia into part of an Asian exchange.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will bring much - needed interest in Macedonia, where unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will like it because they are more than 80 percent of the population who love Nato and the EU," says Zeevene after the vote on the bridge.
Saying "yes" will be the result of " certain certainty of our future."
A list of votes will be published on the last Monday by the Macedonian Police Center held between 30 percent and 43 percent of voters who will participate in defendum-down the number required for the election to succeed.
One list of voters, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, has been found 57 percent of the people who are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, about 70 percent said they would vote for you "yes."
To achieve the success of the election, a vote of 50 per cent and one person over.
Failure of the desendum will cause the first powerful blow to the pro-Western state police since their taking the line in May last year.

Trump’s files in West Virginia
The President has referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his choice of a person in the High Court by Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the leaving of the Republicans to vote in the middle order.
"Everything we have done can be lost in November.
Five weeks remain before the history’s choices and the most important one in our time.
This choice is large, large (I'm not running and I don't run for this is exactly what I am everywhere striving to find suitable people for our defense," says I.
Trump goes on to say, "You see the bad features, the bad things of the violent Democrats, you see happening at this moment.
And they are willing to take over the power of the administration by using whatever means are appropriate, cruel, merciless.
They don't care who has hurt them, who will go above him, to gain power and authority, and only what they need in power, we will give them."

Her father - in - law Labour is divided.
Those who speak from the heart can no longer communicate what they feel
When the Momentum's activists in my local party voted against me, it was strange.
After all that, I am the first one in the Labour List to be told not to be generally expressing their opinion.
My fellow Parliament, Joan Ryan, found similar treatment in my home and stood up against the Jews.
In my case, the situation of criticism and opposition to me was very different from Jeremy Corbyn.
To the important economic police force at work, to the security of the country, Europe, by posting similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with previous addresses.
A meeting notice Nottingham East Labor wrote that "We want the meetings to be included and have good results."
During the nearly eight years that I have been the N of Labour in the community, the GC's night meetings on Friday have always been exactly the same.
Where today, however, this modern meeting is not a social event that we usually have "human and gentle, low" political and yet forget, however, and can never begin again.
It seems a growing tendency for different opinions that are not accepted in the Labour team and that all the opinion is being considered before being accepted by the crew.
This began after Jeremy’s entry into the leadership seat, as a fellow worker and I had used to think of sharing with him in a similar political outlook and expected me to turn it over and take over places I did not agree with that I would not agree with it; it would be an international security or a sale and one of the EU.
Whenever I speak out-and what I don't care about it is following the harassment on the communications pages is said to be down to the seat, not to be accepted by the traditional politics, I am told I didn't fit to belong to the Labour party.
And that is my experience.
Thus, I know that I am more fortunate than my fellow workers as the parliaments direct me and they want to be political.
I respect the art and determination of fellow workers who face sexual or racial harassment every day but cannot keep them away.
One of the most reprehensible aspects of this often proves to be political in nature, the degree to which the violence has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour team had taken up the tradition of endurance.
The reality is that we are no longer a large part of the community and in a state of "besides of despair" or of changing the standards of a minority.
I have many suggestions for the past two years to ask me to stop, not to speak of my way of speaking and then "It's all right."
But this is not what I would do in politics.
That I joined Labour in 32 years as a schoolboy, being urged by the Chatcher government not to neglect the room where I have been studying, since then I have vowed to fight for the best of the people's and needs, especially if I have been a plan or a minister of the government.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including the previous elections.
None in the East of Nottingham can be confused by any way about my position in my police, as well as where I do not agree with the current leadership system.
In these improved circumstances, I can say, in all cases, that while Brexit has influenced you to hurt you in our homes, business, and public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labor team.
But the reality is that the one message I have is not to the Nottingham Momentum, it is to my people, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am selfish about working under you and promise that no cost of prestige or political help can prevent me from doing what I believe is your most important need.

Aymar 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes ahead
Two latter sets are fixed to the end of the course that nearly led to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of such a fine victory for the celebration of the Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they are increasing the rate, which is the most divided side.
Finally, it was their high degree of security, with their opportunity to take advantage of a better opportunity, which resulted in the living rights of home and tutor Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested in our games until now, and we have not yet been beaten, therefore I must be happy," she said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: "Ayr, do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson in his star was 14 minutes, replaced by Frzier Clili, and put Ayr ahead, but, by the Scottish post card, Roy Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the numbers and Jason Baggot to try to change them.
Clili has suggested Ayr's leadership for April, before, a half-time game time, he has added the article and then changed the subject to 17-5 to Ayr during a break.
But Melrose started well with the second half, and Patrick Anderson's cloth, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the period of five points.
It has been said that it has been a long time since Ruriadh Knott’s serious injury, which has been unleashed by the coliseum, and when the Ayr is resumed, it is rapidly increased by the Stafford McDowall, translated by Cli.
An Ayr captain Blair Macpherson has been given a heavy card, and once again, Melrose has rewarded another man with the untranslate of Bruce Colvine, under severe pressure.
However, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for erecting Cli without a pencil line of penalti, MacPerson has gone to bed behind him as Ayr casts it.
Clili has changed, as nearly since the start of the new season, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong’s balls into the box and sent a pen to Gregor Henry to a distance from putting the fifth tie.
The Still Game item appears to be committed to a new task in the section of the annual
The Still Game General Ford Kiman seems determined in the reception department after it has been discovered that he has been appointed the director of a poster of mail.
A 56-year-old man is playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, which he writes with another laughing jeopardre Greg Heppill.
The two had already stated that the coming nine classes would be the last one to conduct this show and that Kirsten was apparently preparing to do something else after Craiglang.
According to tradition list, he is the ruler of the Adriftmorrn Limited.
The player has not wanted to comment on this article, although the source of the Scottish Sun has said that Kirnan wants to enter the "bestreaming industry" in Glasgow.
‘ Our sea: Bolivia, with hope on the earth that the way will open the way to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol the masted headquarters in La Paz.
Public-and-afts flash the blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon comet with the words: "Our sea is legally ours.
It is our job to find it again.
Throughout Bolivia’s narrow world, the memories of the shores of the Chilean war in the 19th century are still vivid in their minds — as do the desire to resurgent into the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been high in centuries, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the world’s legal court on October 1 after five years of discussion.
" Bolivia is strong, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and is waiting for a good spirit results," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian tourist.
Many people in Bolivia will hear the judgment of the World Court of Justice at the highest court in the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand on Bolivia’s agenda for decades after just another conversation with Chile is forced to consider giving Bolivia a beautiful land into the sea.
Evo Morales, a Bolivian president who has life and a descendant of a native of that country, faced a difficult battle to be chosen the following year — also has much to do with the Monday judgment.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," confirm it by the end of August.
But some social commentators claim that a judicial hearing on the opposite side of Bolivia’s side would be less likely to change this.
The United Nations Council of the Netherlands has no power to excommunicate the land of Chile, and it claims that he cannot know the results of possible speech.
The fact that the judgment of the World Court of Justice was issued only six months after the discussion indicates that the case was ‘ free of charge, ’ says Paz Zárate, a civil law specialist in Chile.
And instead of cooperating with Bolivia’s wishes, four years may have taken a turn for the worse.
"The case of sea access has been confiscated by the existing Bolivian government," said Zárate.
The words of Morales ’ struggle have ended any kindness they still had in Chile, as they say.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but the conversation will be too much longer.
These two countries have not moved together since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the court’s decision in an unusual way.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to reveal on a new page of working with Chile" and the "end of 139 years of disparity for the benefits," says the report.
Calzadilla has also rejected the fact that Morales - is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — using the sea as a political center.
" Bolivia will never cease its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome things that have happened in the past."
North Korea says that it will not give up nuclear weapons until it is safe to trust the United States
Northern Korea’s U.S. Secretary - General Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not lose its nuclear arsenal if he does not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday in the United Nations Parliament.
He asked the United States to follow the promises made during the conference in Singapore among leaders who dealt with eye - in - eye problems.
She utters these words just when the chairman of the State, Mike Pompeii, appears to have resumed a nuclear silence over three months after Singapore and Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's a "monial's day" that the continuing and refusal of the United States to end the Korean War will cause North to surrender.
Washington is careful to sign the agreement before Pyongang first took steps to get rid of the weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second conference.
But many doubt that Pyonging is willing to give up what the country considers to be the only safe haven.
Pompeii plans to visit Pyongh this coming month to prepare a conference on Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion model depicts the latest scenes that you will see on the streets of a city near your home
If you want to extend your hats or to take the sun away, then go elsewhere.
The inventors Valentino and Thom Browne have begun to create a vast array of the most unusual pieces of the S19 displays that have come off alongside the deck set up in the Paris Week of the Factory.
These startling hats have spread to Instagram in this version, and these designers have sent their startling hats to the view.
Valentino's solitary hat has a broad blade and covered the head of the overseer.
Some of the largest hats were covered with earrings, a hat, and even a pin — but not designed to warm your head.
Also, Tham Browne came with a number of tragic masks right back in the Nohepe era.
Many of these brightly colored cakes have beefed lips and are similar to Hannibal Lecter’s fashions.
One hat would say that it was to get into the water with a breath and a liquefy, while the other was like a slip of ice cream.
And if you are attracted to popular fashions, you are fortunate.
According to a model’s reviews, these hats may also be coming to your area.
These outstanding hats are in the steps of La Bomba', the sun's hat with two - foot - wide angles worn by people such as Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The Bible that made these unusual hats filled with the communications pages has brought with it another large display - of - a - case case case carried along on the beach nearly as big as the wearer in the laundry that you carry.
Raffsi a orange bag, with a flu-movable white-white cap, has been ahead of Jacques' La Rivier SS19 in the Paris past.
The famous inventor Luke Artitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the large hats and bags of the sea coast reach people in the following summer - since the designer' will be too difficult to care for the people who would want these big things.'
John Edward: Language skills that are vital for people of the world
National private schools have a reputation for higher education, and this has continued in 2018 and other tests that have not yet taken place, which are strengthened by each individual and by the success of a team in sports, art, music, and other social activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer a high level of service to their students and parents.
Single schools try to equip their students for higher education, choice of subjects, and place of employment.
As part of an educational program that can design and replace the school curriculum, we see existing languages continue as a favorite subject and a choice requirement for school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak with someone in a language you understand, you reach his mind.
If he speaks to him in his own language, he shall reach his joy."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on the English in order to build friendships and trust with foreigners.
From the recent results of the study, we can see that languages are high on the table with a high degree of access to private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have received articles in Higher grade A.
The data collected, from 74 schools of SCIS, indicates that 72 percent of the students have received Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the French students and 63 percent of the Spanish students have received A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland sponsor foreign languages as valuable skills for children and young people who surely need one another in the future.
Now languages, as a choice study, are equally valued as studies of STEM (Science, technology, self - feeding and mammatics) in the laboratory of private schools and others.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons given by employers to have the problem of filling hours at work, 17 percent are associated with a lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly needed in preparing young people for future assignments.
As more and more employment spaces call for language, these are vital in a cooperative world.
No matter what employment you choose, if you learn another language, you will have more opportunity in the future to acquire this type of skill.
Being able to communicate with foreigners has opened the way for someone to speak many languages.
According to your You Gov test by more than 4,000 older UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to converse and only 1 percent of French is spoken by more than 6 percent, 15 percent.
That is why making money to increase the language is now important to today’s children.
A knowledge of many languages, especially of those in developing lands, will equip children for better employment.
In Scotland each school will have its own language.
Several schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important in the UK when viewed in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from private schools, and there will also be good teachers in this section.
The independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide a teaching environment that will equip children with the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they may go in the future.
There can be no denying now, in the business situation of the world, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be seen in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as a ‘ communication capacity. ’
The private schools will continue to offer this choice, separation and retirement to young people in Scotland.
Il leaves bien in free.
John Edward as Head of the Scotland Council for Schools Alone
LeBron will break the Lakers record on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is only for those who want to see LeBron James as the starting point in the Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakes Professor Luke Walton announced that James would play in the tragedy of the Church against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it will seem that she will be playing for a few minutes.
"You will be more than one or less than 48," said Milton at the official Lakers Web site.
Lakes Lakes reporter Mike Trudell said that if James had played only a few minutes, he might have played.
After training early in the week, James is asked about his plans for the sorrow of Lakers.
"I don't want prefashion games in this level of my work to be good," she said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his protest gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of its five planned meeting for this coming week that included visiting friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate is established until he decides to be appointed in the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to sign a second election because the Republicans are in danger of losing the Congress ’ presidency in vote in Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia last evening, and how can you view it on the Internet?
The Trump convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch West Virginia’s West Virginia convention online on a trima from YouTube.
Trump is considered to speak at the weekly meeting of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, in a difficult case because of the charges of misconduct that may be suspected of a week’s check by the FBI.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help members of the Republicans cope with the November decision.
Therefore, the President Trump's project has said that the five meetings for the coming week are aimed at "to strengthen the volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and increase the figures they have in the House of the Constitution and the House of Representatives," reported Routerers.
"Congress control is so important to him that the president will go to so many countries as long as we approach the busy power station," the Tump who did not want to be known to tell him.
Organized at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the modern reality of the night can cast off support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and are known to Pittsburgh for its news," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which was won by a 40 - percent victory in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republicn High Priest Patrick Morrisey, who follows the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morsey that the president is forced to come and give him support," says Simon Header, a principle scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ruder Cup 2018: An American team shows that if you hunger for success, you will continue to fight like them to go to sports on Sunday.
After three sports alone, playing as the first of four characters became the main need of this Ruder Cup.
The rank of top of any team has given the notion of sports a particular belief in sports, and a competition like this.
Who, then, is to be the most important figure right now?
"They paid with six articles and are now four, so I think we were ahead," says Jordan Spieth while traveling that day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, four points over and a 12 others have not yet been confirmed.
The Malinnas, as Steve points out, feel that they are doing well and that there are many who may be interested in them, including how they have played well throughout the day and the couple have three and four articles.
Stephanie has always played well since its introduction and paid for example.
When people shout with excitement while he is playing, he puts the ball at a crucial time of the game after he and Thomas have been hit by two blows.
Binge in a hole that gives them a 15 - degree success rate gives people the same sound, in a way that tells them that the American team cannot be defeated.
"You must be concerned about your game at all," says Steve.
So they left.
18 holes to mark it.
The characters on the Spieth and Thomas of the past two days are Franceso Molinary and Tommy Fleet, a controversial story of the Bird Cup
The European way of life is unique and cannot be wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the one who won't catch the gogey on Saturday and Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and the Back Nina on Friday morning.
That cooperation, along with their interest, is seen in the crowds as a victory for the church, and no other athlete has a reputation for winning Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood and Moninari.
It is better for both of them to play at the same time in different places.
Reporting on the success of Europe is still invisible, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked on Sergio Garcia, a champion of four balls in the morning, when he obtained a partnership with Alex Noren.
The Bogey and two other articles traveled by twofront four and the Spanish hole and Mswidida that they were unable to get out of it.
On Sundays, though, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Four footballs and four players are happy to see them nearby because of cooperation, advice, advice, advice, and how the program can change in a relatively short time.
Europe has been better off as a team until now and is leading to the last day, but four players have shown that the American team is hungry for an unconventional failure if possible, especially Stateside.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Kinder Cup.
Europe will lead well on the last day of the Ruder Cup after the four articles and four games that have paid them in 10-6 Americans.
It is interesting for the couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game to win the suffering Tiger Woods to make progress in the Le Golf National by four points.
The case of Thomas Bjorn of Europe, seeking to conquer the cotton that defeated them in Hazel in the past two years, won the American morning trial by four points, winning a series of games by 31.
America did not readily agree with the four games, which have won the two games, although they had failed to end the debt.
Jim Furryk’s side requires eight articles in 12 games for this presentation
Fletwood was the first European to reach four new points at the same time as Moninari, they were called "Molliwood" after the first week to win four notes in the opening of the Kinder Cup.
Woods and Patrick Reed’s four balls carry over to victory over Woods and the Melikas in the Italian squares Brysin Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who has drawn to two Saturday games, has shown interest there and is but has divided 19 to 29 games she has played on ball games with four players and four players as well as clubs in a row.
Justin Rose took her partner Henrik Stenson in the Forum in 21 and 1 who divides Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world leader
Europe was hardly an ideal place in France.
Three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas did a very good thing for the Americans with two articles on Saturday.
Having won 2 and 1 times when playing with Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of these fo'c'sss again separated Paul and Rory McIlroy by 4 and 3 of the fours and two opening holes.
As far as the Redder Cup is concerned, the team comes from the division by four points to individual games, although the Furyk side needs to play at each other to win the prizes.
After the second of two days, the attack on the church protected them.
North Korea says that it ‘ will never complete its equipment before it is secured.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea has told the United Nations on Saturday that the sentences make it suspicious in the United States and there was no way for America to complete its Nucler's weapons when they could receive security certificates.
Ri Yong Ho has told the attending board to take positive steps in the past year, such as to stop the test of armaments and the disarming of Nucles, and to promise never again to make nuclear weapons.
"Even so, we don't see corresponding steps from America," said.
"If there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country and in this case we will not throw our arms away without speaking to America."
While Ri reevaluating what North Korea had said about the refusal of America to complete the Nuclear weapons in stages under which North Korea was rewarded for the small measures it took, his report did not deny what Pyongya did to complete the badly-runed weapon.
Ri told of a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the president of the United States and the North Korea President in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on " complete the Nuclears instead of Korea" while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to bring an end to the war of Korea of 1950-53 justly, but America said Pyonng should first eliminate Nuclear's weapons.
The Waington has rarely been applying for lowering the severe international sentences facing North Korea.
"America is forcing the "running of the Nuclear weapons first" and increases the level of pressure with sentences to achieve their purpose in a strict, anti-war," says Ri.
"The idea that judgment can frighten us is a false dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the sentences will increase distrust.
R has not discussed the plans of another Kim conference and Trump, which the American leader spoke before the United Nations for this week.
Instead, the officer spoke of three conferences between Kim and the ruler of the south and Korea Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the group of the Nucler is in this case, not the United States, could complete the Nuclear Arms instead of Korea's."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech sounded different from the previous year, when speaking with a general U.N. convention that the aim of North Korea's flying weapons in the United States was inevitable after "Mn. Wicked President Trump" called Kim "man of the flying devices" who wanted to kill himself.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened the ‘ complete destruction, ’ North Korea, courageously gave Kim a praise by taking steps to eliminate weapons, but that means that there is much more work to be done and judgments will be far out of reach for North Korea to complete the Nuclear Arms.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no set time, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongang for the measures she has taken.
Even so, American secretary Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The delay of the courts of the Security Council does not continue very firmly until we have seen the total installation of Nuclear weapons.."
The Security Council has expanded sentences in North Korea since 2006 with a view to ending the cost of Pyondn's flying Nuclear Systems.
Pompeo met with Ri beyond the General Assembly of the U.N. and said that he was going to visit Pyonng again to prepare for the second assembly.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but her last visit has not been successful.
He left Pyondang in July, saying that there is a development that has been made, but North Korea is independent, saying that he made "the same requirements as robbers's."
North Korea promised to meet Meon this month so that they could break up the part of the flight-gun Nucles if America's "actual measures."
Kim told her that the "equal precautions" that Trump promised them in Singapore and the progress in regular contact with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in sufficient rest and relaxation
A new study at Harvard University this year made all the students who are not yet pregnant sleep enough to fight the culture of learning all nightly using caffeine.'
One expert has found that high school students do not have any idea of how to support themselves.
Charles Czeisler, director of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School, as well as an expert at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, did the study, which he believes was the first of this type in America.
She was encouraged by her talk about the results of not having enough sleep in the study.
‘ When she finishes one of her classes, a girl comes to stand up and says: ‘ Why am I told now, am I going to finish school?'
He said that no one had told me the importance of staying awake, which amazed me, and told The Telegraph.
This study started this year, explaining the benefits of sleep regarding academic and sports development, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health care at the university, said that the university decided to bring this lesson to the attention of students who did not get enough sleep.
This one - hour, or full - hour, study involves a series of exciting assignments.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom room, where students knock on coffee cups, curtains, training clothes, and books to explain the results of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants are told how lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its fascinating feature, encourages the participants to think about the things they are accustomed to do each day.
‘ We know that he will never change the behavior of the disciples' immediately.
Even so, we believe they have a right to know, as you also have a right to know the health consequences of smoking," says teacher Czeisler.
The tendency to lack sleepiness is still present, that is, to add that modern technology and stress to students are a growing problem.
To ensure a good night’s sleep should be an unknown tool for fighting stress, fatigue, and anxiety, as well as avoid obesity, as lack of sleep weakens the brain, causing it to become chronically hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old resident in California who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to study this class, after he attended his first class in Harvard for his first year.
She said that the class had opened her eyes and that it was interested to make the whole school available.
He hopes that the next step to ask the students to make the same study program before entering the plant is a competition.
Her teacher Czeisler advised students to think of creating a 24-hour alarm, as well as wake, and to be alert to the harmful effects of electrical light bulbs and LED light, which can interfere with daily schedules, which can result in sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Ringers Menga won Gerard’s men by one point
The Ringers again faced a problem when they played in the run while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrad with one point of point (1-0) in Livingstone.
The Brox side was on the move for the first time after St Johnstone had hit 41 February. But the group of Gary Holt struck Gerard the second time on 18 games, and then he started to be manager as eight points apart from the runaway gang in Ladrokes Premiership, Herts.
Menga received an article in a few minutes before the haf-time and the Ringer players were not interested either.
At the time the Rings descended to the sixth place, Livingstone climbed to the third after it was left by Hebernianian for one article.
There are yet problems coming to the Ringers after the linesman Clum Spence was treated with a head injury after he had been hit by a missed object from the side of the players.
Gerard has changed times to accompany Ayr in the game before the last Beefred Cup.
On the other hand, the Holt continues with 11 of Livingstone's 11 players who took one point from Hearts the previous week and rejoiced at the way his team beats its opponents in every way.
The Ringers have controlled the game, but Livingstone did more when he obtained a ball.
It should have hit a point in the second minutes when the Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass through to Allan McGregor's ball but the player did not find it.
Keshoghan Jacobs rejected the hold of Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to open it on the rear steps.
The Ringers got no control but seemed more optimistic than about the third act before the last.
Alredo Morelos felt he should have received a pencil in a half-hour sign as Steve Lawles and the topctor Steve Thomson had met up with him, but Steve Thomson did not listen to the complaint of the Colombian performer.
Ringers had the opportunity to kick the ball near the edge of the first stage of the game but with an Ibrox Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassna Coubal and Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that has been hard to find, no one can deny that it is truly worth it without hard work.
Ringers also failed to prevent the ball from being struck by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not like Declan Gallagher who handed a ball to Scott Robinson, who did not worry about winning Menga.
Gerard made some initial changes as he changed Coubally put Ryan Kent to the change and immediately produced results as the player opened Mooralos, but the great player ran away from the block.
But Livingston has continued to make this moving party to play what they want, and with Lithgow and Halkett, they have been running the ball away again.
The Holt team could receive an article at the start of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow placed it on the poles by head.
One of the Rings’s later incorporateds, Glenn Middleton, has another court case as he faced Jacobs, but he was not the victim of Thompson’s opposition.
Almanac: Geiger Context Creator
And now the page from "Sanday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 1322 years ago, and SATA ... date for scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of checking and measuring the effectiveness of radiation, which was produced by the development of a device known as the Geriger Counter.
It has been used since then, the Geiger Counter has also been used in pop culture as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Corondao," with the unconventional characters Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Husband: "What's that?."
Rogers: "It's Geiger Counter, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the effects of Atoms, which are produced by radiation.
Evans: "Tell, it's true."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, after a few days of his 67th birthday.
But this eye bearing his name will live on.
The new cancer control teaches the body cells to “see ” severe cells
The new cancer control teaches the body cells to “see ” severe cells and kill them
The immune system teaches the body’s muscles to view the cells as a component of the treatment.
The procedure involves getting the body cells out of the patient’s body, changing them to lab
So they can ‘ see normal proteins in cancer and are reactivated in the body
The tried vaccine produces promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received treatment with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells in her body, observed ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing the body’s cells from a patient, changing them from a laboratoryory until the "see" normal proteins in cancers called heR2, and restoring them to the body
University teacher Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute established in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have some possible prohibitions.."
HER2 "gives rise to different types of cancer." including breast, ovarian, ovarian, steam and stomach, explains university professor Berzofsky.
The same method of removing the body’s tissues from patients as well as " self-training" for cancer cells has worked in the leukamia clinic.
Kane West Conserving Trump’s Support in the Talk, Wearing the Trumbo on the MAGA, after the appearance of the SNL.
It Was Not the Best
Kane West had not received the fine support during the Saturday Light Live after the song of praise to the American President Donald Trump and said he was going to enter the election by 2020.
After singing the third song that night, the Ghost Town, which he sang with the Trumm on a tape recording composed by Mike America Great, he said a speech against the Democrats and repeated the support he had given.
"Many times I talk to a white person when they say, "How can you love Trump? you are a racial person"
And I say, If I were concerned about race, I would have been gone a long time ago, he said.
SNL has started its program with a video showing Matt Damon laughing on the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh before the Court of Justice by sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not widely distributed, the West video is now placed in a corner of the courtroom by the humorist Chris Rock.
Little wonder that Rock was trying to ridicule West on this video.
Also, West is angry to the audience that he faces difficulty before entering his gathering.
"They used me back.
They said, ‘ Don't come in with this package which you are carrying.'
They had abused me!
And they say I'm in the place which they have said," says the Washington Examiner.
The West added by saying: "Do you want to see a point of falling?" which means that you will wear "Superman" because it means what I want. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to show love.
His talks did not receive support from the SNL viewers and employees, says the Variety, and another person saying: "All the radio is silent."
West is brought to the place of Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rap singer Mac Miller a few days ago.
The West is puzzled by the song I Love It, composed like Perrier Bottle.
West has received support from the head of the TPUSA, Candance Turner, who wrote to Twutter: "I speak to the most courageous person: I'm A BUIOLOGY.."
And the system administrator Karen Hunter wrote to Twutter that the West had just said that he was ‘ very real and it's wonderful.
"But I made a decision not to pay anyone (by buying his music or giving him support with his "suspect") which I believe he receives and brings out dangerous ideas from my people.
You are free.
Likewise with us," you add.
Before the program, this rap singer informed Twutter that he had changed his name fairly, saying that he is known as "Ununive West by justice now."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, known as the Puffeddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His associate rap singer, Snup Dogg, has changed his name to SNop Lion and the lost composer of ancient history known by the Prince who changed his name to the sign.

Kit Harrington is known for holding a sword as he imitates Jon Snow in the violent, violent film of the former HBO, The Game of Threenes.
But the above - mentioned 31 - year - old has pointed out the contrary to what many believe about a powerful warrior, who says that such roles make boys feel obliged to express themselves in order to gain honor.
Speaking of the custom of the Sunday Times, Kit believes that ‘ something goes wrong ’ and wondered how the problem could be dealt with the risk of attempted suicide during the #MeToo period
Kit, married to her principal partner at the Peace of Thorns Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admits to ‘ feeling hard about dealing with this problem.
'I feel it difficult, according to my case, so where am I?'
‘ What have we taught men when they are growing up, about the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television has a role in the problem of trying to make a man suffer because of his male role models.
He added: ‘ What does it teach?
What is taught in television and on the street, making boys think that they are forced to become men?
How do I feel about this adjustment in our routine?
For there is an obvious thing that is not good to our boys.
In this debate he even agreed that he would never play in the movie again at the end of this coming version, saying that he had ‘ finished with wars and horses.
Since November Kit will be featured in the movie movie Sam Sherpard's True West of the film producer's story of the film show and his brother, who is a burglar.
He claims that meeting Rose is the best thing that can be found in the Game of Threenes.
'I have met my wife in this system, and thus I have helped my family and my life from now on,' he says.
Rose was imitating Ygritte, a lover of John Snow, in an action film that won award.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new patients
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people in this country, and the medical authorities say.
An estimated 40,000 cases were identified in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
Often people are affected by the disease through sexual activity, something different than normal in the past.
Naturally, many people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of people affected in this way was virtually gone, and the medical authorities in China said at a conference on the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
Sexually affected with HIV is a real problem for China’s LGAT society.
Homosexuality is no longer a dominant force in China since 1997, but prejudice against the people of the GBT is said to be difficult.
Because this country is so unregulated, research has revealed that 70% of men and 90% of men are going to marry outside society.
Several times the effects are created are not sufficiently safe in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised HIV infection as part of the problem.
Maxine Waters object to information about the SOP nets issued by an unprovoked official, a ‘ heavy lying ’ and ‘ talking about things that are not there'
American representative Maxine Waters on Saturday challenged the charges that one of his employees put personal personal details of the American Republicnets to Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles meant that these charges were spread by experts as well as by Web sites that took their part.
"False, false and a lot of lies," says Waters in the Report on the Matter.
According to the reports released home addresses and phone numbers of these American individuals. Lindsey Graham of the south and Carolina, and Mike Lee included Orrin Dutch, Utah.
These information are presented on the Internet on Thursday, fitted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the time of the synod's speech about non-management and the charges against the Supreme Court’s decision of Brett Kavanaugh.
These quotations were released some time later and then sent questions to Kavanaugh.
Wise Web sites such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedSTate report that the IP conditions indicate that the source of input comes from Waters Office" even published details of Waters' staff, says The Hill.
"These false charges are completely false," added Waters.
"A member of my employees - isle because personal information is published because of these missing false charges - has not been responsible for the removal of these statements.
This groundless accusation is absolutely false.
Waters report has received quick criticism from the Internet, including the former secretary of the American President Ari Fleischer.
"This denial rather than sound," writes Fleischer
"This indicates that he doesn't have the degree of membership of the Congress.
When an accusation is made concerning a person’s actions, there is no need for you to be consumed with anger.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to ask the accuser’s motives.
It must be kept quiet and quiet."
Fleischer might have compared Waters ’ response to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being furious at the fourth wave.
Omar Navarro, Republican ivory with the election of Waterers during the year, has also expressed his opinion to Twutter.
"Great news if this is true," he writes to Towtter.
In his call, Waters said that his office had declared ‘ proper authorities and legal courts with false charges.
We will ensure that the suspects are exposed," he added, "and they will legally pay for their risky actions to my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again - defeated Rowan Atkinos
It is not uncommon for days to check around Brexit when watching a film about English - related film and in this old comic and the violence of a knight Johnny English - taken from 2003 and returned in 2011 to be called Johnny English Reborn.
Will this exciting film cover the issue of no longer being able to sell abroad?
This man with a placard face known as Johnny English has received his license to renew his name, indicating that he is a curse made by non - English observers in other countries.
She is really a government worker who is very different from the youth of Clouauau, and Mr. Bean and at least a boy who sang one musical article in the Chariyots of Fire in the event of the London Oliphirics in 2012.
He has even become a stranger and the international secretman Atkinson who did so in imitation of the Barclaycards, leaving the same conflicts where he was going.
There is a time or two since the movie has been shown.
I like the time when Johnny English came to the helicopter in his early protective clothing while the helicopter hit his wheel.
Atkinson's gift of innocent humor is fascinating, but it is not powerful when compared with such difficult products as 007 and the Mission Imponsil, which include now humor.
These humor may be considered to be not for adults, but when I spoke against Johnny’s laughter English, it does not show how much ability to compare with Atkinson’s uncommunicative film when playing Bean
News on this movie will indicate that the English are in serious trouble.
The Internet operator has unwittingly entered the network on the Internet, having seen details of all the English artisans working, until it is surprising that the artist at work - a very small part of Kevin Eldon's role.
The news goes right through a proud, high official dealing with the problem of not being popular as a politician: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as she plays Teresa May, but the film’s producer is not doing good when she writes it
The wise counselors told him that like all the spies are at risk, it is necessary to bring back a retired person.
And that is how old Johnny English, who has had the position of being the head teacher at school, is a good teacher, but providing lessons without the tradition of being a known witch, while English is teaching a more unusual way to be a coward than ever.
English is sent back to Whitehal and told of this emergency to meet his best friend Bough, also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, married to the Captain of the Navy.
This capable couple are returning to work when they meet Ophelia Bulletova, who is dining by Olga Kurylenko
While, a high official believes a billion - dollar scientist who can solve the problems of the English computer: evil man Jason Volts, by Jake Lacy
England and Bough began the process: making themselves donors, burning the French food stands; they started problems when they boarded the rich Volta ship; and England brings an attack while the wear of the Virtual Reality for reading inside the Volta house.
Everything is done in the final sections, though interesting and enjoyable, rather than the television systems of children talking about all of this.
Normal.
Like all other films on Johnny English: Do I wonder if the English movie industry cannot give Rowan Atkinson a suitable role in his ability?
The employment team deny that it is arranging for the British to work four days but to be paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s job team arranged for employees to work four days a week — but to be paid for five days ’ wages.
Reports indicate that the group requires employers to be paid for a day’s wage when companies work with Articial Intelligence (AI).
This change will allow employees to have a three - day weekend weekend but with similar pay.
The sources say that this program will be ‘ well suited with the economic ideas of the party and the plan for the conversion of the country to take the responsibility for the employees.
Turning to a four - day week lists support for the Trades Union Congress as a means for employees to take part in economic change.
The top source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ A series of programs is expected to be announced before the year goes by.
‘ It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is the ideal idea of this group's economic budget to be next to the employees and the company' business plan.'
The task force is not the first to support a concept like this, and the Green Party made a four - day schedule while marking election support for 2017.
The program currently does not receive full support from the Labour Party, however.
A member of the Work Unit said: ‘ The working week is not a team process and it is not something to be considered.'
Assistant director John McDonnell has used the previous week’s work conference to explain his view of the economic translation of the public.
Mr McDonnell said that he is willing to take over the power of ‘ the rulers who don't want to be seen ’ and ‘ get an advantage ’ in the big business.
The service director's plan means that the operators who sell water may not find their assignment as a service government may pay ‘ a fee ’ that does not work well.
He reaffirmed his plan to place employees in the management offices and to make a contract of ownership that includes everyone for the purpose of giving the employees a 10 - percent share of nongovernmental services that would give them as much as £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if the FBI might change them
The FBI investigation of charges put by judge Brett Kavanaugh delays the final vote by his being taken to the Supreme Court for a week, and raises the question whether the results of the research of the site can change the content of the Republicans to change their minds with the support they give.
In a Sunday interview, journalist Scott Pelley asked the member of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could cause them to be braind.
Kennedy seemed to have more trouble speaking than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," says Kennedy.
"I will go into the pit, and speak to the judge Kavanaugh."
I called her after this happened, and after the charges were published, I said, ‘ Have you done it?'
And he was quiet, confident, not afraid.
It seems, however, that Graham’s jaw was never changed.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and will be forced to wear a heavy fitting," she says.
Gqerh. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett strongly deny these sounds," adds Graham, speaking with Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone who speaks about him can testify to these charges.
36 years
I can't see the change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City welcomes the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with the rest of its musicians who will sing for a good purpose; to end poverty.
The event is now over a period of decades, and it welcomes tens of thousands of people in the Central; Park not just to have a good time, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to bring out the purpose of the event that is to end the crisis in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a section in addition to the Global Poverty Project, an international agency hoping to eradicate poverty by adding people responsible to the struggle against it.
To get a free ticket to attend a party (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), you must do a volunteer work such as writing e-mail, calling, or any other practical means of informing others of their cause to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been in achieving its goal at 12 years of age?
Is it a good thing to give people a good idea that they feel they make a difference by signing a network signature or putting the message on Twutter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has reported that it has missed 19 million acts on its supporters, dealing with different objectives.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage the world’s taxpayers to record records of commitments and financial policies of up to $37 billion that would be responsible for the lives of an estimated 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team described 390 commitments and reports on their actions, costing $10 billion.
According to the report, the annual income has contributed to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which is a link between the economic community and the people who make it possible in the U.K "to help children grow up to the extent to which they are supposed to reach," the center promises to provide 35 million dollars to help resolve malnutrition in the country after they received a message from the Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, of various countries and similar Global Citizen states, we may be able to overcome malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition Accey Ullman telling the public during a case in London in April 2018
The group said after 5,000 actions asking the U.K to improve adequate nutrition for mothers and children, the government informed them of the cost of handling the problem, through The Power of Nutrition, which would help mothers and five million children.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet, "What do you think we can do to end a severe poverty?"
The Global Citizen said: ‘ It will draw a long and heavy route - sometimes will fall and fail.
But as a translation of human rights and a campaign to combat democracy in front of us, we will succeed, for we are strong when we are with others.
Janet Jackson, The Weekd, Shawn Menes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, some of the other New York parties, which will be accepted by Deborra-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use submarines to confuse Russia from giving off nuclear - Civil power - Secretary - General
America can find safety under the naval force in order to prevent Russia from selling electronics, including the Middle East, explains American Secretary Ryan the Allies as the Washington Examiner.
All made charges that Russia is responsible for Syria - where government - government officials are legally responsible - planning plans to investigate new power methods.
"I believe that their aim in the Middle East is to sell other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, South Europe's stomach," she says.
And, according to the officers, there are ways and strength to deal with.
"America has the power, by the navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent them, to ensure that their power of power does not go to the market, she says.
All spoke with the participants in a matter adopted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself a "nouncing power force" in America.
He then compared the ways in which America was faced with Russia and Iran, which, says, has not changed.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is almost as likely, to increase values and to find more replacements for oil," that means, while calling Russia for a sponge able to do one thing that depends on the power of natural forces.
This report comes after Trump’s government put forth efforts to promote the export of water - produced greenhouse gases into Europe, entering the Russian hierarchy, with little value to the people of Europe.
As a result, the President of Trump, including the American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the "disorderly" work of Nor Stream 2, says Trump, has made Germany the Russian "inmate".
Russia has also said that this North Stream 2 - billion - dollar, twice as much as the present one to 110 billion cubic feet, is a good job over the economy.
Russia says that the American opposition to this work has economic grounds and is a case of poor competition.
"I believe that the forces should not be the power of oppression, and consumers are forced to choose merchants," says Russian Powerful Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting by American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow on the Sepulence.
The American situation is not well - received in Germany as a result of its commitment to the work.
The leading institution of the industry, the German Business Center (BDI), asked that America move away from the EU policies of power and accords with Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third world interferes with our powers." Says Dieter Kemf, head of the German Business Center (BDI) after a meeting with German President Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Warren criticized President Donald Trump at the city hall, calling his father “the world on the wrong way.
"I’m concerned so that Donald Trump will do it for our freedom," he says.
Warren is known to criticize Trump and his prisoner Brett Kavanaugh.
Writing to Twutter on Friday, Warren said "We need a FBI investigation before we decide."
Nevertheless, the votes released on Thursday show that many of Warren’s followers feel that it is not a good idea to enter the election by 2020.

An American representative accuses China now ‘ exploiting ’ using ‘ false advertisements ’
A week later, the official Chinese newspaper reported four newspapers in an American daily about the benefits of American and Chinese trade, a representative of the country, accusing the country by using American press to spread lies.
American president Donald Trump last Wednesday told of a China Daily advertisement in Des Moines Register - the best - selling newspaper of Iowa -ima to accuse China of its intention to interfere with the decision on November 6, which is a false Chinese charge.
The Trump charge that China is trying to interfere with the election is what American officers tell Reuters that a new section of the development project for America to put pressure on China.
Even though it is common for governments in different countries to install ads to promote commerce, China and America are currently working against trade and laying new prices.
China adds prices to the problem of commerce at the beginning of it and is designed to affect foreign importers in regulations such as the Iowa that support the Trump of the Republic, say experts in China and America.
Terry Branstad, an American representative in China and the former governor of Iowa, sold a large portion of food to China, and said that China has damaged the American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Brantad wrote his opinion in Des Moines Register, "He is now bent on exploiting us by putting false ads in our free newspapers."
"When spreading false reports, the Chinese government is putting it at risk to hear America adopting its common free speech culture as well as having free information and advertising sites in Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"Unlike, instead of the news here in Beijing when you go down the strato, you will find a few small differences and will not see how the Chinese really think about the economic development in China, we think they are under the Chinese Communist party," writes.
He added that "one of the most common newspapers has denied his request to publish the article" though he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans excommunicate the rebels before the establishment of the election of the Kavanaugh case, warning the researchers
As the High Court’s High Court prisoner Brett Kavanaugh and protects him from his charges, sexual abuse, the critics say they will see bad guns, especially for those who have gone around, in this coming choice of the first half.
Feelings about this situation have been passed over, and the Republicans still say that they want to continue the election.
So you can't put it back," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of political studies at Syracuse University's Maxwell School telling The Hill when the article was published Saturday.
Reeher can doubt that the last time efforts of the Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to start a FBI investigation to change the opinion of angry voters.
"Religious people will not immediately forget what happened yesterday - will not be tomorrow or November," says Karen Jean-Pierre, a top counselor and international spokesman for the group forwarding Moveon on Friday, according to Washington, a D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters would again say, ‘ Come on November! ’ walking in a crowded corridor as the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee and decided to continue the deportation of Kavanaugh in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The interest in freedom and encouragement is great," says Stu Rotheberg non-particator, telling the media.
"People are already saying that you are up, this is true
But there may be more than this, especially to the rowdy people who have not yet decided to vote by whom and the new voters, aged 18-29, who, although they love the president but who are not familiar to vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony explaining his charges against the hostages of the Supreme Court of sexual abuse, the critics say that it can have negative effects when the republics require a guarantee.
"This has turned out to be a problem withGOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Commitee last week when it starts, according to NBC News.
"It is not important for the final committee or for Kavanaugh to enter the department, about how the Republicans deal with the situation and whether to treat her," points out Guy Cecil in the media, the director of the Progries USA, a team assisting the Democrats
Even so, the aunts don’t seem to understand whom they believe between the evidence of Ford and the Kavanaugh, although there are a small number who take the latter side.
41 percent of the participants in one survey indicated that they likely believe or believe the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent have shown that they believe it completely or fully believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent thought that Kavanaugh could possibly be certain that he was wrong while witnessing, at the same time, only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s interest, the FBI investigates the claims of Ford and another spiritist, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford has issued an oath before the review committee of justice a week ago that Kavanaugh had abused her for 18th sex when Kavanuagh was drunk
Ramirez claims that the hostage of the High Court introduced his private parts to him while they were still attending Yale during the 1980s.
The Internet producer arranged a new Internet project to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet producer, sets up a new business with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technological marvel consists of a new innupuncture, a Solid - producing industry that is available to everyone.
Solid allows its users to choose where their information is kept and who has the right to see the details.
In an interview with Fest Company, Berners- Lee has discussed the goal of the Inrupt concept of "a world control."
"We have to do now," talking about the business.
"A Spiced Minute"
This system entering the technology will allow people to make themselves a ‘ information storage facility ’ or POD.
It may include a list of phone numbers, a list of requirements, a calendar, your music, and other personal and job items.
It is similar that Google Drve, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are in the same position at the same time.
Different from this storage area if the user chooses what the person sees.
The company calls it "for personal preparation of knowledge."
The Inrupt Plan, according to chief firm John Bruce, to bring weapons, systems and corresponding skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a system purchased by IBM, the personnel who promote the program, and the community of volunteer manufacturers.
Since this week, international technology producers can produce a program that has made all of them possible using the technology found in the Internet.
Berners-Lee said that he and his group do not speak "Fapiruk and Goode" about bringing about a major change that could cause their business to collapse immediately.
"We will not ask their permission."
"Uterners-Lee wrote to the Media on Saturday that the aim of the Inruptinian "to give interest in businesses and places that will help protect integrity and new Internet standards made by Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet while creating the World Wide WebConsortium in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the months that follow, Berners- Lee has become an influential voice on the Internet conversation.
Even when it is correctly opened in Egypt, Berners-Lee is yet to be the administrator and director of the World Wide WebConsortium, the Internet Center and the Open Data Center.
"Please pass through this new network," adds Berners- Leee.
Bernard Vann:ctor of Victoria crossros by WW1
The first and last week to obtain Victoria Cross in the time of World War.
Lt. Col. Cardinal Bernard Vann won the prize in 29 September 1918 during the siege of Ballingse and Lehaucourt.
Even so, he was killed by a firing squad and died before four days ’ notice that he would win the highest prize in Britain.
The monument was opened on Saturday by his two grandsons in Rushden, Northhamtonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, says that the discovery of the stone is not easily forgotten because it has been carved over 100 years since his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, in 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann paid the men under him to pass the Canal de Saint-Qentin's "with heavy fog and heavy guns and machine guns."
He later fled to those who were shooting and with a lot of courage, carrying the heavy guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German who had a gun gunpowder at the end of the war on 4 October 1918 - more than a month.
Michael Vann, who is 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions are ‘ something he doesn't know he can't do, but he said it wasn't humble.
He and his older brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a biography after a watch on the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he feels that he feels ‘ glorious since he has had trouble in youth" and adds that "the courage of the warrior of truth will be shown by people who give much support."
MMA maintainers did not sleep to see Bellator 206, but they found only Peppa Pig
Think about this: You don’t sleep because you want to watch Bellator 206 just to meet and play it.
The San Jose system has 13 wars, including six which have been distributed overnight at the UNHannel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., at this time Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, observers at the UK were surprised to see a change in the playing of Peppa Pig.
Some have been as embarrassed as they stayed up all night until morning to watch the war.
One follower described this change as a cruel joke
"The government legislation if since 6 in the morning that system was no longer appropriate because they had to change what could not be seen by children," "We mean that the president of advertising and the contact of the Bellator, when asked what happened.
"Uupp the pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker said they would change their times next so that the UK spectators could also see.
When I think about playing it again, I think it might be possible, says Cooker,
"The problem is that time is six o'clock in the morning around them on Sunday we will not be able to do this until Sunday around Monday.
But it also brings with it a plan
I believe, when it turns over with a lot of toys and it is not all fun.
We tried to fix it, and at first we thought that our problem was our own mechanical problem.
But if not, it has been the State’s problem.
I promise you that it will never happen again.
We will reduce five wars to five times as much - and try to bring far more of what they expected but to do.

Forest Island Disc: Tom Dayley feels ‘ less ’ because of her sex
The Olympic poet Tom Dayley says that he grew younger because of his sexual appearance — but gave him a desire to succeed.
This 24 - year - old says I have seen that I go to the second grade if I'm not like other people.
Speaking of the first policy of the Desert Island Discs by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he says that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
She said that being a parent led her to lose interest in winning the Olympics.
The experienced director of this program, Kirsten Young, has spent months chronically ill with the illness.
To appear as a condemned person in Laverne's first attitude, she says that she felt younger than she was when she grew up because ‘ it was not permitted to love boys and girls.
She said: "To this day, feelings of sadness and uniqueity have been my greatest interest in the ability to succeed."
She wanted to present herself as ‘ something, ’ saying, so that everyone should not be disappointed when they find out about her sexual appearance.
This winner of two Olympic copper medals has spread to the public with the LGAT and has used his fame this year to the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to grant justice.
She said because she feels fortunate to be able to live without problems and wants to give others the "hope."
The world’s three world winners said that he was in love with an American filmer in 2013 - he was ‘ not expecting it. ’
Daley has married this Oscar conqueror, who is 20 years older than she last year but says that the gap between them has not been a problem.
"When you are dealing with such things at a young age" - going to her first Olympic at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - says that it was hard to find someone of the same age facing similar life problems.
This couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that ‘ all his ideas' have changed.
"If you asked me a year ago I would tell you that I need to ‘ find a gold ring, ’ she said.
"You know, there are major factors to complete the Gold of the Olympic.
My sign of Golde Robbie's Lobie.
Her son has the same name as that of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
She said that she never believed in her father’s death and that one of her final predictions had asked her if they had any tickets to London in 2012 — as she wanted to stay behind.
"I didn't know that you won't be in the front seat.'
"I would hold her by the hand when she finished breathing, and I saw after she no longer had the breath, she would not be able to stay forever," she said.
The following year he competed with the Olympics in 2012 and received a copper medal.
"I suddenly realized that this was what I had always dreamed about - tosing in the water before the crowds at the Olympic Games, and I could not hear anything better," she says.
He was also impressed that he gave his first talk — Father Small — and he was also afraid of what followed by his first talk — Father Sall.

Mickelson is absent from the play environment on the Ruder Cup game on that Saturday
Mr. Phil Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th - class Good Cup game but has to change his play to avoid making this unpleasant record.
Mickelson, who played the ceremony twice a year for 12 years, is put in a chair by Captain Jim Furryk on a four - soccer game with 4 people.
Instead of being viewed by the crowds, as he often did in America, this victorious conqueror spent half his day devoid of play and reemerged with the purpose of correcting his problem.
Although at the top of the game, the 48 - year - old player is not well suited for playing in Le Golf National, where the grass is available and makes it difficult for the soccer player.
If the playing field itself is a scary game, Mickelson, at the ninth - grade game on Sunday, faces Francesco Moninari, with a top British Open soccer team, who has collaborated with Tommy Fleetwood in order to win all their games in this record.
If the Malinarys, less than 4 articles, can properly start 12 games alone, Mickelson’s game will be less important.
Furryk has shown as much trust in my husband as possible.
"Because he fully understood his role today, he struck me a little behind and held my arm and said that he would be ready tomorrow."
"You really trust yourself.
You have found a place in a famous hall and have added much to these groups in the past time, and this week.
I didn’t think he could play two games.
I thought he was going to play sports, but it was not going our way.
You want people to know you, like everyone."
Mickelson will pass the Nick Faldo’s record of many games in the Kinder Cup on a Sunday game.
He can make his decision to play in the Kinder Cup that does not differ from his personal record.
Mickelson has won 18 times, 20 times exceeded, and 20 times has been reduced, and Furryk said that his presence brought unseen elements to the group.
"You’re joking, joking, quick to answer, like to hang around people, and you’re a good person in the gang room" he explains.
"It was very common to see young players laughing for her in this report to be glad to see that."
He provides only a good measure of happiness.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a high degree may soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that we can quickly lose a position of leadership as a group still takes the lead in the Reder Cup but that can change at any time.
This champion started playing in 1997 in the Valderrama game, where the case paid by the Sever Ballestros was five-decors but was later carried on, in 141.13.
"You will tell you that you have many articles in Valderrama; you have many articles in Brookline, where you are rented and in Valderrama, where we won, hardly," on the clock Bjorn, which is displayed, after watching the 2018 glass victory at 5-3 Friday and last day in 10-6 Le Golf National
So history will teach us all and everyone else if you have not yet completed this.
We're going to pull out all we have in the future
We will do all we can to do.
This is not yet complete until there are points on board.
We have a purpose, and it is an attempt to overcome this pressure that is aimed at us.
Once again, I refer to 12 players on my side, but we know that we are dealing with any of the other players that have escaped the world's rest.
Delighted at how his players played in this difficult game, Bjor added: "I never thought of it.
The next day the dirty word means something else.
The next day personal ability to play is tested, and the opposite is the case.
It is common for you to have a partner there when things are going well, but when you are alone, you are first tested as an athlete.
This is a message that has to be found by all players, and should be displayed tomorrow.
Now, don't come with your partner, and he's going to show himself up again."
In contrast with Bjorn, the man on the other hand, Jim Furryk, is looking for his players and not for a team, except for the Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, three - quarters.
Furryk himself had been both of these changes for the last day, being on the side of Brookline when it won and was defeated as Europe did the ‘ miracle in Medinah.'
"I remember all that she said," answers Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, how did she interest them when they were going to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but you should not put them in mind as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
Once you start winning regularly, it puts pressure on the game.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that draws good results, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to pay for the return of the war and is faced with the Rory McIlroy in the upper games, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter the Yurpou.
"I went with this group of men because I thought it was all right," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
A German warship has again been misled.
A new German ship should be set free in 2014 to enter a warship known as the Cold War, but the following year will not be released because of the ship's problems and cost, says the news.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a ship which is paid for the rest of the ship represented by Baden-Wuettermberg-clas crigates, is reduced to the first half of the 19th, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, says the military spokesman.
The ship should not have entered the navy in 104, but the loss of goods has made it possible.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships in 2007 will replace the Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be great power equipment, along with the fireships and aircraft and other technology that would make it invisible to Radar, infrared and acouctics.
Also important is that it takes a long time before repair is needed — every two years away from home.
Still, continued interruptions make these new ships, which are said to give Germany power overseas and are out of the way when launched.
This masted ship was released in the news last year, when the German navy declared it off duty and returned it to Blom & Voss in Hamburg
It was the first time the Royal Navy had returned the ship to the ship on duty after it was introduced.
Little is known for the reasons for the ship’s being astern, but German journalists have reported that there are problems with the "ships and goods" that make the ship work well so that it is useless when it is in war.
Machines are more cautious as the ships of Baden-Wurttemberg are used by 120 per cent of the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
Also, it appears that the ship has a very heavy load to reduce her skill and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This vessel with 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be two times larger than the ships like which were used by the Germans for the second world war.
Despite the lack of goods, the cost of all this work — as well as the cost of teaching employees to use it — has begun to become a problem.
It is estimated to have reached 1.5.1 billion ($3.6bn) from .2.2 billion
The problem of these new ships becomes important when it appears that the German Navy is on the decline.
Early this year, Hans-Per Bartels, head of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy is ‘ losing the ship' to the war.
The officer says that the problem has grown as the years have gone by, since the older ships were exempted from the army but no new ones were put.
He said that none of the ships of Baden-Wuttemberg were able to enter the navy.
New Trust listens to the news of flying creatures like rats
The new Scottish Highlands surrender seeks to explain that the animals use the shape of their habitat for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on how these animals behave and how they can be protected.
This study by scientists from the National Trust in Scotland will follow these familiar animals, which produce soprano, long - eared, and Daubens in Invete Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in special locations in this area for the period of the year.
The NHS staff and volunteers will check the staff with hand - held machines.
Acoustics will take a closer look at the record so as to identify the frequency of the species they call together.
The map of the nesting sites and the report will be made to give a picture of the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar is a health adviser to the NTS environment, hoping the results will be to see the approach of these animals of any kind.
These information will help us to see what benefits it is to protect the wildlife habitats and how to preserve the forest habitats.
The presence of animals in Scotland and the UK has decreased over the past 100 years.
They are at risk of building and developing habitats.
Air and light can expose these animals as well as flying paper and chemicals from buildings, as well as the attack by cats.
These animals are not invisible.
Nevertheless, their daily need for food is often greater than their eyes when it comes to catching food.
They get their food through a vibrations when they return to their ears and recognize their food or prevents them from flying.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 older areas, 38 important gardens and 76,000 square miles [76,000 sq km] of the land, assume that these animals are important.
They have ten trained experts, which make a resuscitation, surveying their living quarters and at other times rescues.
The site established a exhibit in Scotland at the Shreave site in Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
The director of the site David Thompson described the area as the proper place for them
"Here in Threave we have a beautiful place for these animals," she says.
"We have old places, old trees, and a good place to live.
There is much you know about animals, so the work we do here and other places will help us to explain what they need to survive."
He says that the importance of studying these animals before you take care of the environment is crucial, since if a pet is injured, 400 children will lose their balance, which can completely cover such an area.
These animals are safe and illegal, disturbing themselves and their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, head of the Scot Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There is still much to know about these animals and many species we don't know.
Ronalo has stood up against charges of sedition and has also been able to obtain a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando calls rape charges a lie, saying that people want to make a name for himself.
His attorneys will fine up the German press Der Spiegel, which is the source of the charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus player is credited with rape by an American surrounded by Kathryn Mayorga, a hotel in 1999
It is said that he then fined $375,000 to say nothing of the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of the Instagram that spread to 142 million of his followers just a few hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, who is 33 years old, is against himself saying "false."
"No, only, but not only, but also.
What they say today, lies all over," the Ballon d'or winner five times says on the camera.
"They want to make known my name to people.
It is normal.
They wanted to be known by my name, but it has become familiar now.
I am happy and ready," added the player, laughing.
Ronalo's attorneys say they are ready to fine the Der Spiegel of the charges on which they said "an unregulated report of the claims of personal self - abuse," according to the Reuterss.
Justice Christian Schertz says that the player wants to give up the ‘ spiritual damage due to the abuse of personal rights over the past years.'
This event is said to take place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the bar of a bar of alcohol, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the theater of the athlete, where they were raped back, according to papers placed at the Council of Clark County in Nevada.
Moyarga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the event on which he was charged and which is the "righteous man" "99% of the problem is one percent of the other."
The spies say that Ronaldo made sure that the couple had slept together, but they agreed.
Moyarga says that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries from the hospital, but later they agreed to speak to each other without the courts because she felt she was afraid she would return and was concerned about being humiliated."
The 34 - year - old says that he wants them to come back because what he said about Ronaldo is still painful.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the charges against him, and this summer to the great Italian group Juventos sold at about £100 million
Brexit: UK would ‘ be eternally sorry ’ for the loss of car manufacturers
UK "will regret forever when she will not lose her top position in producing cars after Brexit, says computer operator Greg Clark.
He added that it was worried that Toyota in the UK told BBC that Britain could travel the EU over an uncommunicative line will take a slight turn to produce their plant in Burkaston, near Derby.
"We need a connection," says Mr. Clark.
This car manufacturer from Japan has said that the tendency to slow down the flow of goods on the border if no connection to Brexit can finish the job.
The Burman production of Toyota Auris and the Avens – has produced nearly 150,000 cars during the past year that 90 percent of those sights were shipped to other countries in the European Union.
"It's my opinion that if Britain goes to the EU at the end of March we will see a presentation stop from our appearance," says Marvin Cooke, governor of Toyota in Burkaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have expressed their fear of walking the EU without a combination of how it would be commercially trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its production of Oxford Day at about a month after Brexit.
A serious concern about this may also have a commercial impact when there is no connection in Brexit.
The Toyota presentation list is conducted by the system of "processing," with car goods coming every 37 minutes from the UK and the EU vendors for the purpose that cars be set up to buy them immediately.
Even if the UK travels without a link in the EU in 29 March, there may be a barrier in which the business claims to be slow and insufficient clothing.
It is unlikely that Toyota will have clothes that will fit the date on its release at Derbyshire, so this business will be stopped.
Sir Clark said that the program of Theresa May and EU's contact with the EU is "to avoid this test on the border.."
"We need a connection. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take up this opportunity," telling BBC 4 BBC on a site called Today.
"A testimony not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we were with a fully successful development."
Toyata does not appear about how long the display lasts, and over a long period, warning that rising costs will reduce competition skills in time after completion.
Peter Tsollaviris, who has worked for Burkaston for 24 years and who is in the United States in the article, says that they are about to be worried again. "I know that when this work goes, it will never return."
A government spokesman says: "Bring us a reliable plan concerning future conferences with the EU
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed, says the American president’s office
The important meeting of Donald Trump and general representative Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week as the battle of the high court’s decision by Brett Kavanaugh continues, says the president.
Rosenstein pursues the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who does research on Russian elections, as well as the conference between Trump and Russia and the violation of the legal arm by the president
The fact that Trump throws him away without a universal representative, endangering Mueller’s defense, has been the cause of much gossip in Washington in the past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said he would wear something to record the conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president with 25 correction.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But on the last day, he went to the White House House House, and among the reports he was going to resign.
Rather, meetings together
Trump said that he would not choose" to dismiss Robenen, but the meeting was intended to avoid a dispute in the Commitee atmosphere where Kavanaugh and one of the sex offenders, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Tump has authorized a one - week investigation of the FBI with charges against Kavanaugh, which has announced the full Volume of Senate.
Trump journalist, Msz Sarah Sanders, has appeared in the Forx News on Sunday.
Asked about a meeting in Rosenstein, he said: ‘ The day that you haven’t been used, or not this week, I found that a weekly remuneration is given all the other things that happen in high court.
But we will see and always like to keep the pressure renewed. "
Some scholars object: The Sanders did not drive the White House line since September 10.
The nun, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of explanations was not due to the confusion of TV merchants, although he said: "I won't agree with what to look at."
He recommended that the direct contact between the Trump and the mounting wind.
"The President made Q&A sessions and sessions instead of any president before," he added without counting the evidence: "Look at those numbers."
Reports will happen, Sanders said, but "If the printer has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the president of America, it is better to talk to me.
We are trying to do so and have seen him do much more during the last few weeks and it will take place for the printing article when you speak to the president of the United States. "
Trump always carries questions when leaving White House or taking part in open sessions or joining conferences with passing notes.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president was probably showing why, creating freeheeing and certain times unseen before meeting the media.
The secretary of Health writes to the EU staff in NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the ESO's staff in NHS to express their national gratitude and wish that they live in Port-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter in less than six months until the UK has dropped to the EU.
The Scotland government has devoted itself to meeting the cost of EU health applications for citizens working in public services.
In his letter, Msz Freeman wrote: "In the summer, conversations between the UK and the EU have continued, focusing on decisions expected in the autumn.
But the UK Government has compiled its provisions about an impossible situation.
I know this must be a very disturbing thing for all of you.
That is why I want to value the contribution of the entire crew, no matter what.
The brothers from all over the EU, and more, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, and benefit the sick and the society we use.
Skotland is your residence and we want you to stay here. "
Abercrombie Chrisby Ingos Surgery Emergency After Hearing Head Injury
The Tennessee State State Backbacker Chrissy Abercrombie was elected immediately after head abuse on Saturday of the Vanderbilt Commonres, a report by Mike Organ.
Rest Reed of the State of Tennessee tells the press that it is a short time before it is too late.
"He came to the side line and fell down," said Reed.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie on the course before laying her up and returning her test.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not opened at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is no "experience of type/ magnitude of injury at present" and Tennessee State is trying to determine if there is a cause for injury.
Abercrombie, redshir sophomore (The Juneor University, but only in their 2th year of college football), the first vacation and the Tennessee State after the transfer to Illinois.
She had five soldiers on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought her full time to 18 obstacles.
Buyers of other subsidies will be paid when they buy a UK property
Foreign consumers will be paid when they buy a UK protein and additional funds used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
The increase will reduce the success of Corbyn driving to attract small voters.
The increase in the factory work will be paid for those who do not pay the UK tax.
The Nondbe is expected to stand up to £ 120 million annually to help the homeless
Sellers of other products are used to pay for the high quality of the station work when buying goods at the UK - and extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring them today.
The rise will appear as an effort to reduce the success of the Jeremy Corbyn drive to attract small voters with vows to provide the purchase of the homes and focus on finding higher ones.
The increase in the station work will be paid by people and nonpayers at the UK taxpayers, as well as the additional money for the Russian control of sleep and sleep.
The additional fee for the current operation of the station, including the high levels installed two years ago in the two homes and the purchase facilities, may be about 30 percent.
The Nondbe's expected to increase to 120 million annually.
At least 13 percent of the new buildings built in London are purchased by the UK population, driving costs and making it difficult for the first consumer to get foot on the level of housing.
Most of the world’s rich areas - especially in capitals - have become ‘ villages ’ because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend their time in the country.
The new policy comes about weeks after Boris Johnson asked that the stamp be cut off to help the new people in their homes.
He persecutes large firms in the construction of high - quality profits by excluding property but not using it, and urged Msz Mei to leave the platforms in the purchase homes to repair the British "flame of houses."
Mr Corbyn has introduced a list of proposed house repairs, including the management of a net and the loss of the discharge.
He also wants to provide many large firms to build new homes.
Nksz May said: "Last year I said I was going to give up your premirership to restore Britain’s dream - life for each new generation.
And that means repairing our house - to - house business.
Britain will continue to be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it may not be easy for blind people at the UK, as well as outside companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens.
To most people the dream of a home cry has been too far away, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains a reality. "
Jack Ross: 'My top breast is control of Scotland'
The Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that his "high ambition" is to be the head of Scotland at a certain stage.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of building a library in the Northern East, which is now located the third place in the League One, three taking high.
He moved to the Stadium of Light on this spot after leading St Mirren to the Scotship of Scotshison.
I want to play my country as a performer.
I have B bulls and, "Ross told BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Henden very much and as a child, and it remains my protection.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in the management of the library.
Ross ’ top managers as Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio
The former administrator of the Alloa Atlantic says that he did not have the courage to follow cross names in a large library, which has already lost places from Barsley and Ipswich City.
"The success of me at this time will be followed by 'Can I restore this library to the Head of the League?'
In view of the structure and facilities in this game, there is no doubt that to the Premirer League, he said.
"It's not easy to find it, but probably I'll just check to succeed here to return to the group."
Ross for only three years in his chargeer, after the time as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days in the Living castoff.
Then she helped Alloa break out from the third eye, and changed St Merren from the position of support to the Championship level in the following area.
And Ross says that he feels more relaxed than he had during his play at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be a real thing," she recalls, by taking Alloa.
"I really believe the rule is good for me, rather than to play.
It sounds so good because I did well, made a good life in it, and I enjoyed a high degree of happiness.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things you have to do with each piece.
I am still doing so in terms of the pressures and pressures of the work, but the control feels just right.
I always wanted to be in control and now do that, feeling free to be in my bag for the rest of my life. "

The total moment of the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, the research sees
The summer heatave has encouraged the release of heavy British bridges but more pressing in restaurants.
Pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent sale in July - but taking from restaurants was a 4.8 percent reduction, indicated the number.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy CGA, which included these numbers, said: "The longer the sun and England stay with you than you are expected to take part in the Council of July following the same example in the previous year of June, when the tubes rise by 2.8 percent, unless the dining places are hard.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the merchant market in June increased dramatically in July.
Alcohol - carrying prosthesis and broken bars are more than a love of more than a love of low - lying dining room.
Food - guided tubes were also destroyed by the sun, though they are not as much as eating drivers.
It seems that people want to get out of the bottle.
Of all oralpubs and alcohol bars there were over 6.6 percent for the month, with 3 percent of food.
Paul Newman, recreation analysts and host guests, said: "These results continue with the air we have seen since April.
The weather and the effects of large social or sports events are always the prime factors when it comes to the trade in the outer market.
It is no wonder that shops continue to fight, although the prices of sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly painful at the costs of continuous costs.
A long-term hot summer that has not arrived at the worst time for the drivers who take the lead food and time will tell that the temperature taken in August will give more breath. "
The general increase in the market inpub and shops, including the new opening, was 2.7 percent in July, indicates the improvement of the white oruts.
The Coffer Peach Tacker of the UK pub, bar and food food section is collected and measured the task can be taken from 47 working groups, with the combined cost of over 9 million, and the standard medical indicator.

System feeder notice by comparing mothers and cattle to separate the Internet opinion
A breast-milled pump company separates the idea of online sales and a declaration that identifies young mothers from domestic animals.
To introduce the introduction of what is called the first "bestable pump," Elvie's technical company released the title of the mic-in-cheek video presentation to show the new freedom the pump provides to express mothers.
Four mothers have a bull dance in the rasps on the trails which include sounds like: "Yes, I’m pretty, but you can't see a tail" and "If you didn't notice these things, it's not."
The korus continues: "Pamp to get out, feed a little lamb, pump it, throw it out, I will put my girls in it."
However, the advertising, which is printed on the file page, creates a conflict online.
In the eyes of 77,000 and hundreds of voices, the video has received numerous responses to viewers, many say it means ‘ upset" in the milk industry.
"The proper solution is using cattle to declare this product.
As we say they must be pregnant and breast - fed to produce milk, unless their babies are told before the days of childbirth, "you should write one.
The chest gun of Elvie corresponds closely inside the storage vessel (Elvie / Mother)
Another said: "A clear concern for both mother and child.
But why not use the pump pump to the mothers who will keep their children? "
Another person adds: "Insecurity in sales."
Others protect the proclamation, a woman admits that she has received a "clean."
"I think this is a human idea.
I’ll be alone if I’m talking about it.
I felt like a bull.
The announcement was very painful, but I accepted it.
This is a kind of brain, "one wrote it.
Another said: ‘ This is a beautiful advertisement directed to the mother who pumps (often in their working or private places) and feel like a ‘ cow'.'
This is not a declaration that exalts or condemns the milk industry. "
At the end of the video a team shows that they were all playing with pain pumps.
The theme after the project is based on the sense that many women who are known as captivity feel like cattle.
Elvie Pump, completely silent, has no wire or diapers and is firmly interspersed within the vagina, allows women to walk, hold their children, and go out.
Ana Barin, a partner and ECD to Mother, said, "Elvie's perfume is such a product of a revolution that was due to the development of courage and enthusiasm.
By showing the similarity between the showing of women and the milk cows that we wanted to set the breast beating and all the apparent difficulties, when it reflected the fun and the appearance of senseless freedom that would bring.
This is not the first time Elvie pump made a head.
During the time of the end of the Mondon Fordon week, the mother of two children was seen in the deignk of Marta Jabowski while using this product.
Many of the People of the River are busy in the Texas Borderr Central Camp
The number of children used to move out although the flow of the lunar boundaries remains constant, because of the fact that strict control and management policies made by Trump make it difficult to place children and support.
Traditionally, many of their supporters have become foreign, and they threaten their ability to live in this country by extending the child’s invitation.
The risk increased in June, when government authorities announce that all potential clients and other older members of their homes have to wear fingerprints, and if the cast is shared with the authorities.
Last week, the City Albence, the senior officer and the Changes for the Expelling of the Outbacks and the Reduction, testified before the Conference that the Aparent has held many people who have applied for support of non-interactive children.
The Ministry later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not received reports of crime.
"At least 80 per cent of the people who support them or family members are illegal in this country, and the great majority of these foreigners are lawbreakers.
So we continue to pursue those people, ‘ Mr. Alence.
In order to further the children quickly, the officers promised new laws that would require others to appear in court during the month of imprisonment, shortly after 60 days, the former conditions, in connection with the residence staff.
Many will appear to attend a telephone conference, rather than enter the person, to defend their cause in the case of the move judge.
Those who are judged unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
After a long time of living in a cell, children may say that they can be anxious or depressed, which may eventually lead to or out - of - control, according to the entertainment industry and reports of the program in the months ahead.
Supporters say that this concern is raised in such a large institution as Tornillo, where the child’s symptoms may be forced, because of its size.
They added that taking the children to the tent town without providing enough time to prepare themselves physically or to say that they can be friends can cause a lot of damage to them.
Syria tells US, French, and Turkish to rely too quickly
In view of the United Nations Convention, foreign President Walid al-Moulem also invited the refugees of Syria to come home, although the world war is now eight years away.
Moulem, also serving as a prime minister, said that the foreign Syrian army illegally, in the sense of combating corruption, and "will be taken properly."
"They should be dismissed immediately and without restraint," said the congregation.
Moulem stressed that the ‘ war of an event is raging in Syria, where over 360,000 people died in 2011, as well as millions of other people were taken from their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we have finished the whole region of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, generally training and counseling the Kurdish forces and the Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 world wars in a war - torn country.
In the case of the refugees, Mouelem said that these restrictions were good for them to return, and he said that ‘ other Western countries ’ because of the irrational fear that makes the refugees live far away.
"We have called international areas and public organizations for this payment," he said.
"They have treated what should be the concern of the people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no improvement in Syria until there is a political treaty between Assad and opposition to the end of war.
The UN connections say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey is to be established at the metmpon level of the Idlib tower creates an opportunity to advance political terms.
A Russian-Turgent speech attacked a great assault on the health Russian population of Russia, where three million people lived.
Moulem but stressed that the agreement was "soon" and expressed the hope that the war-part will focus on the ghadsts as well as the Al-Qaeda-Choda's advocates associated with Nusra Front, "will be destroyed."
UN delegate Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will include the first meetings of a new committee assembled by government members and opposition to design the policy of the Syrian war policy and run the course of selection.
Moulem put the circumstances of supporting the government of Syria to the committee, saying that the district work must be prevented from "reconstitution of current principles," and warned against disturbances.

Apart from money it is flooding in selected tribal areas
It is no wonder that 17 Pennsylvania sees a flood of losses, thanks to a change in cases involving the affected areas in the same seat.
A region that had recently been destroyed in the town of Pittsburgh recently reached the Democratic Rec.
The Lamb works against another identified individual, the Republic of Keith Rothphus, now representing the 12 Pennsylvania district, which carries the highest 17th.
Maps were raised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January if old district was not under principle by Riphabliki's favor.
A new competition in 17 has prevented the financial system between the major financial interests of the team, the Democratic Committee Committee (DCCC) and the National Cultural Council (NRCC).
The Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a young child to a special guest with a special March on 18 of the Central District District District District in Pennsylvania.

U.S. Measures Penailing El Salvador With China Support, then supported
The Diplomats say that the Dominican Republic and Panama Republic has chosen Beijing, never to leave Washington.
Mr. Trump had a delightful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a partner released the Trump Organization.
The authorities of the Department of Government have decided to restore the American delegates of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about the "experience of the past's] soon to be destroyed if they can see Taiwan," says Heather Nauert, who speaks for the Department, to the province for this month.
But the sentences were considered only about El Salvador, which received $140 million about American Aid in 2017, with drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishments, which include the establishment of funding and the proposed security barriers, would be painful in the North American country and the lack of high employment and the rates of murder.
As the internal conferences progressed, the officers in North America and North America turned down a high conference aimed at security and economic development to follow the same convention last year that was considered a major step in preventing immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid - September, the management officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, completely ending any examination of El Salvador's sentences.

Reading history
The following index to drop may be the special counsel of Robert Mueller’s Mr Trump to defend justice, where there is plenty of evidence in public details.
Mr Mueller is said to have answered his research and that Mr. Trump’s mission has been linked with Russia in its attack of our choice.
If the Congress will change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself faced with a burden of that body, as he is ready to go back to the voters, perhaps finally being a judge of his peers.
This is so much, and I don’t want to show that Mr. Trump is inevitable or peerless in Europe.
There is a choice to make our own thing on both sides of the Atlantic that will prevent the extent of the remote struggle.

The course of history rounds about such points, and the unremitted democracy is fast or irregular.
Americans are facing articles on the subject of the latest publicity.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fire the Chairperson-General Rod Rosenstein, man who controls the Future of Inquiry by Mr Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper, and, in the past year, he was secretly advised to write the president and make an inappropriate explanation in the office.
Mr Rosenstein says that the Times account is wrong.
"What will we do when a new investigation asked for FB. Brett Kavanaugh is not limited or should it be established in the Supreme Court in spite of the serious charges against sexual harassment and the evidence?
And above all, will we vote among the Minor Party to hold Mr. Trump?
If we pass that test, democracy will be a long winter.

President Donald Trump mocked Sennacherib Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for his insistence on having a copy of the book from Christine Blasey Ford against the Supreme Court’s president, Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at the West Virginia conference, the president did not clearly express the testimony given by Foei before the Court of the Court of Court, instead of focusing on that what happened to the Senate indicates that people were ‘ speaking and being up and down.
One thing that can happen and that is a good thing that goes on during the last few days of Senate, when you see, when you see people burning and speaking and relaxing, said "I said."
"When you are looking for a discharge and a leak and they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. "
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinsstein, do you smoke?
Remember his answer ... Is he paying the box ‘ yes, what? ’
Oh no.
I didn't wake up. "
Yes, wait a minute.
Do we match ... No, we didn't go out, "Add, on the solar level.
Feinstein sent a letter to the Kavanaugh by Fordon in July, and it survived early in September - but Feinstein was rarely from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. F Ford's Reports, I didn't destroy his story, "Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"He asked me to hold it secretly and keep it secret as he asked."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who said on Saturday night: "I will tell you that, that was a very bad thing of the body.
Maybe not, but it is the worst kind of body I have seen. "
To further the defense of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president explained that Democracy is used for their sentences.
"They are willing to restore power in any required manner.
He sees the meaning, the injustice, the indifference of who is wrong, who must work for power and control, "Mediaite has told the president.

But even though his fellow workers were fleeing their lives, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Aguung refused to leave his position on the level of flying control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
She remained ensuring that the Batik Air Fight 631, which was at the time, was able to move safely.
Then she went up to the level of traffic control when she thought she had fallen.
She later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could save hundreds, Australia reported the ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Baltonpan in Kalimantan to take her to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we were lost today early in the morning before the helicopter arrived at Palun.
"Our heart listens to hear about this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death peralty is reaching thousands and the national disaster relief agency says that reaching the towns of Donggal, Sigi, and Botong is decided.

The opposite is that Tellis has known the Chambers for about two weeks when he dies.
Phone records indicate that they know only one week.
Rowlett said that after the death of Chambers, Tellis was removed the caps Chambers, telephones, and contact information on his telephone.

And another black man?
NYny dots two after firing after the word "racial."
New York andny tell the couple quoted after obtaining a wrong text from a mother complains that she is a "one black person."
The couple deny that they are impartial, likening the suit to the "robats."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed concern when she found out that the child’s minister, Gielle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of the project in 2016.
"Unless I HAVE ABTTER," wrote Nksz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a passage.
Even so, instead of sending it back to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After observing her gaffe, the "not worried" Plasco-Flaxman was expelled by Mrs.
Msz Maurice was paid one working day and returned home in Uber.
Now, Maurice prepares the couple for the return, and she wants a payment of $350 a day in 6 months, the gig who lives in the beginning, if there is no agreement.
"I want to show it, look, don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding, "I know I’m opposed."
The couple have filed charges of racism, arguing that to quit Maurice’s work was a reasonable reason, fearing that they would trust her after she provoked him to anger.
"My wife sent her something that I don't like to say.
He is no part of a people.
They are not racial people, ‘ the husband of Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you put your children into the hands of someone who did fast, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come.."
To compare a suit to "robbering," Plasco said his wife was only two months old if she had a child and was "hard."
"Will you follow such a person?
That is not the best thing to do, "The investment bank."
Although the case continues, the public court is quickly looking for a couple who are quoted from society’s religions, highlighting their behavior and ideas.
The publishers in Paddington feared that the students did not match the speaking bear, a new book shows
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said: "It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads just before you are printed.
I am amazed now to know about the great success in Paddington. "
He says that his father, who served as BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book for the children with a small label, would be a very rare man about his unusual work, adding that 60 years of the book was very pleasant for him to die last year.
In Paddington, which describes as "the most important member of the family," added his father was automatically dependent on his success.
"He was an old man, and was not a proud man," she said.
"But because Paddington was true to him, it was difficult for you to have a child who could accomplish something: he is proud of himself even though he is not real.
I think he was watching Paddington’s success in this way.
Although he was his creation and his mind, he always offered him a debt to Paddington himself. "
My daughter was dying, and I had to scream over the telephone
In the neighborhood her daughter had been rushed to a hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur, where doctors worked at virtually nothing to save her life.
"Nad called regularly if it was wrong, if she was not expected to do it," said Msz Ednan-Lapehouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad that he said he would die within two minutes of the next, and I had to tell him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I like you very much, and I love you."
I will be with you in the near future.
I’ll be with you.
The chemotherapy had given him to keep his heart beating faster and to leave his system.
He had little time left before his hand and all of this was shut down.
I just had to stay and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could neither cry nor cry because I was put in a situation surrounded by family and fellow humans.
I had to hold together.
Finally Ednan-Lapehouse, now grieved by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who were unaware of the problem she was in.
"No one knew," he said.
"I touched my head, and tears were known all the time.
It was hard to explain, but it was in this spirit that I had heard such kind words from Nad.
If she needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved her. "
Bounce-on-protective cards from a bridge
Two women who lost a loved one in death tried to save others from their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to Welsh bridge and encouraging messages and phone numbers to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to experience depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I can feel daily," she said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with a disease affected.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They were always talking about his smile.
Nevertheless, she stopped work before she died, since she had been in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who could have met his brother after he was alive.
Mksz Davis said: "I always worry that there will be a knock.."
Ms Davis created cards, " allowing people to know that there are people outside where you can talk to them, even if you are friends.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Msz Humphreys, who had been friends with Ns Davies for years, lost his 15- year- old partner, Mark, shortly after Mother's death.
"Don't mean she was feeling low or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her attitude.
She was in a lower position at Christmas when the children opened their gifts and didn't compete with them with anything.
He said that his death was the greatest victim of them, but they had to work through it: "He boasts a hole in the family.
Rejection
But we must all continue and fight. "

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the writing as the FBI begins research
"I thought, if we could find something similar to what he asked — a rare research at a time, it is limited to perhaps bringing in a little unity," says Mr. Flake on Saturday, he added that he avoided the committee "division between the assembled gridock.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his supporters of the Republic want the FBI to investigate?
Not all of it is due to time.
The next five - week election ends, on November 6 - that, as expected, the Riphabs do wrong, so they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to find the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has been taking a telephone call to call Senators, asking him to cooperate with Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the Western House to Mr Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI published its report?
There will be a vote on the Senate, where 49 Republics and Democratics now sit.
It is not clear that Mr Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes on the Senate level, which will allow Mike Pence, the president of the president, to break the case and assure him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea ID 'lower' under Kim
The number of North Korean authorities to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un had power seven years ago, said a South Korean representative.
The park, which mentioned the data from the South association service, said there was 1,127 security in the past year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the control is across the border between North Korea and China and the higher levels of importers.
The Pyongang did not create human ideas.
Most of the deaths from the North are eventually handed over by South Koreans.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Korean persons have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many ran in China, with the longest border in North Korea and were easy to cross the Dilitated Zone Region (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China refers to the volunteers as illegal migrants rather than runaways and repeatedly return.
The relationship between the North and the South - which has been legally employed in the war has been extremely successful in the following months.
Earlier this month, leaders of two countries met in Pyingngang in discourses focusing on a lively exchange of ideas.
This occurred after the June history conference between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work in Korea’s unsubmarial Penitentiary Pencil.
But on Saturday, North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong-ho says that the US sentences are due to a lack of progress.
"Out of faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no way for us to abuse it for the first time," says Mr. U.e. for a talk to the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelousi calls Brett Kavanaugh, saying he is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court
The lower head of the House, Nancy Pelousi, called the Supreme Court's person Brett Kavanaugh as the "trinity" and said that he could not serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelousi answered in a Saturday discussion at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman ever did that way, they would say, 'I'" Peloshsi said about her answer to Kavanaugh before the Court's Board of Courts on Thursday.
The Kavanaugh was legally recognized if she had been smoking by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During the opening session, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, at times he would scream and try to converse about his family and his years of high school.
He clearly judged democracys on the committee, which called a ‘ mixed threat and man-organism' combined with the rare facilities if Hillary Clinton lost a national election of 2016.
Pelousi says that he believes in Kavanaugh that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is being abused by Democrats.
"I think you are prepared for such explanations and how the Clintons and Democratics follow them," she said.
Pelosi was stressed when asked if she would try to interfere with Kavanaugh if she was assured, and if Democracys receive more from the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this is that he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress or the FBI, so he isn't liable to be the Supreme Court, but if he is in court now," still, Pelousi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelousi added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judicial sentence of the Kavanaugh Act or Roe v., as it is viewed as the saving righteousness.
In his confirmation of the arrest, the Kavanaugh had answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a dangerous, private person to go to court and expect us to say, 'No,' says Pelolosi.
And women want to protect it.
The diatribe is good, moon and years of burning anger, and cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Msz Steinim said to me 45 afterward.
"Don't I think of something strange, isn't it?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by the wife who was in a certain position, who also cried when she cried, but developed a procedure that meant that when she was full and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, "You think I’m sorry because I cry."
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed to become just as a result of a misunderstanding.
One of my more severe reminders than the first job, in a man's office, where I found myself crying out in a obscuff on my neck is an elderly woman; I am always afraid of anyone who drives me to the platform.
"Don't let them see their crying," he told me.
"Don't know you are angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy that they are coming to you. "
Patricia Schroeder, so the Democraticwoman Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his service as president.
In 1982, when Mr Hart was caught in a metalley's outboard shop called the Shinhin of Monkey and left the race, Mrsz Schroeder, was greatly distressed, he might have thought he had no reason to hold the intention of running the president himself.
"There was no good decision," she said to me with a smile after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in the contest, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called it "Snow White and the seven favorites."
Because it was after the project, it was after funding, and she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
She found that some of her clients who gave 1,000 to the men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a fine?" she wondered.
When he gave his talk that he would not make a legal campaign, he was abused by feelings of gratitude, frustration, and a program that made it more difficult for him to raise money and set up voters than he did, as well as anger at sexism - if he was mature.
"You think I'm going to be distracted," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the printer's reaction to him.
"You think Klenex was my client in the company.
Do I recall thinking about it, they will put it on my rock?
"Did you cry"? "
The success of the Chinese war in Beijing can be a good thing
Salvos of trade between the US and China were deaf, and while fighting is far away, international conflicts can be useful for Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the US, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by dabbling in Chinese foreign speech involving solar panels, steel and aluminium.
A significant increase has been arranged this week for new payments involving $20 billion worth (£50 million), which is properly taxed for all items coming to the US from China.
Beijing re-renewed, %s has recently paid up to a %n per cent of America's $60 million.
China has promised to match the US-shot-shot, and much of the world's economic magnitude is not possible to connect with any time in the near future.
Getting Washington back means taking up the requirements, but bowing down to the United States will be particularly embarrassing to Xi Jinping, president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the pressure of the US wars can certainly help China over a long period by reducing international dependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that begin to throw us off the economy in the country is really more dangerous than the onlookers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an open friend aimed at Asia, says the New American Security Culture, a thinking bank.
Syria 'has prepared refugees to return, ’ says the Prime Minister of Nations
Syria says that it is ready to return to the refugees and is encouraging to help rebuild a country that has been ravaged by war for over seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, foreign President Walid al-Moulem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation of the world is certainly grateful for the progress made to protect crime," he said.
The government continues to restore skeletal areas to restore tradition.
All situations are present now the voluntary return of refugees to a country where they have fled because of violence and the unconstitutional economic values that center on their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in this country also need human help.
Al-Moulem said that the kingdom of Syria would receive help in rebuilding a devastated land.
But he insisted that they would not accept limited help or help from outside their countries.
