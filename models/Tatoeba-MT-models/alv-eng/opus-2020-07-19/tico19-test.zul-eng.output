An event of the rapid growth of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to 15 March 2020
A growing case of corronavirus (COVED-19) shows similar plagues in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that confirm that, although in different parts of the world, COVID - 19 the epidemic is rapidly spreading in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, countries, hospitals, and emergency units should increase the willingness to accept many patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, and especially care for those in a crisis situation.
On 31 December 2019, a group of people with unknown metasiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new coronavirus is now called a superspiratory system zone 2 (SARS-CIV-2).
Since then, SARS-CIV-2 disease has been named with coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far shows that 80 percent of COVID - 19 people suffer from a virtually minor disease, that is, respiratory disease that is linked to or is resistant to pneumonia, and most of these people are getting better.
In 14%, COVID-19 is developing into a very serious illness requiring hospitalization while 6% of the remaining cases are facing a serious condition requiring critical care.
The death rate of patients imprisoned for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the rates for the growing COVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EAA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
It also compares the current number of people with COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and that in Italy during January 31–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 conditions in EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread widely in areas and changes in the world’s COVID-19 epidemic currently follows what is happening in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a plague.
The 5 March of Eurosurvellance 2020, Spperi et al. reported the first confirmed people with COVID-19 in Europe who agree with WHO definition.
EU/EA, the first confirmed persons reported by France on 24 January 2020 to the people who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, people with COVID-19 were found in all 30 countries of the EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom (UK), which is, between 31 December 2019 and that day, 39,768 persons who were infected with the virus and 1,727 dead persons in Italy alone.
To find a growing number and increasing events of the COVID-19 conditions
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), statistics for people with COVID-19 in each country worldwide, only are obtained by legal sources such as the National Institute of Health, the national and regional health authorities as well as WHO, are repealed every day by 8:00 a.m.
This data was used for reviewing the cost of COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the continuing COVID-19, we count the growing reduction of 14 days of COVID-19, thus considering the natural progress of the COVID-19, in each of the EU/EA and UK, during the period of 1 January 1–15 March 2020.
We also introduced a growing number of reported national conditions on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. when compared with Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 In the EU/EA and UK
The 14 - day - long-reducts of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries often follow those of the Hubei Provence (China) (Image 1).
In all of the EU/EEA and UNK, a growing COVID-19 event started to rise about 21 February and received a great impact on 28 February 2020 (Stuction of reading).
This has been greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported conditions from Italy, but all other countries of the EU/EEA and the UK show the same increasing rate of COVID-19 events (Sappreme reading aid).
An image 2 shows a growing number of COVID-19 conditions, in the EU/EEA and UK, compared with that in Italy during January31–15 March 2020.
It points out that, on 15 March 8:00 a.m., some 15 countries of the EU/EEEA and the UK had already reported a total that is comparable to that of Italy in 3 weeks before or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The factors mentioned in the growing COVID-19 event indicate that the epidemic continues at the same rate in all countries.
This happens despite that countries in different parts of the world, variations in the public health approach of the public, and likely different definitions of situations in different countries and different types of proteins to choose patients that should be checked to confirm COVID-19, which includes a follow- test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described the situation when 10% of COVID-19 patients needed emergency care and the media reported that hospitals and emergency medical units in these regions had reached their high rate.
The data for the entry of COVID-19 to the hospital and/or critical care unit is found in the EU/EA in only 6% and 1%, respectively (the data has not been shown).
It should, however, be organized in order to conform to the current watch that focuses on the number of reported conditions and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a great difference regarding the availability of critical and central care facilities in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in a population of 110,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 emergency beds and personal care in the population of 100,000 in 2010–11).
Imitating conditions associated with the prevalence of health care, which provides the average country of the EU/EEEA and UK regarding the growth of conditions in the hospital for COVID-19 related to the risk of crossing the number of intensive care units, is given in the sixth return for an emergency test of ECDC emergency checks regarding COVID-19.
As conditions accumulate in some regions in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and emergency care units often help certain people in the region, information about the circumstances and intensive care facilities should be obtained from the level of Nonmenstrual units for statis 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experiences as well as current heards from other countries showing that COVID-19 epidemics are rapidly increasing in the EU/EA and the UK.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 communications unit and the increase in COVID-19 patients in need of medical care, and especially crucial care, as is the case in the affected regions in Italy.
As shown in a recent study of the emergency ECDC, a quick, enthusiastic, and detailed approach is important to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making changes from the control path to a slow process, as the expected rapid increase in the number of conditions may not prevent decisions and hospitals from granting them enough time to understand, accepting and adapting their response to a proper course if they are not used in time.
A study of immediate accidents also refers to public health measures to help control the spread of the epidemic.
There is a small chance in which countries are not able to have further control of their efforts to reduce SARS-CIV-2 and reduce stress in health care.
Failure of this, it is possible that the simonys for some EU/EA countries will face a host of patients who need special care in the days ahead or weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus (COVId-19), caused by a respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CIV-2), is currently killing more than 3,000 people and has had more than 880,000 cases in China and other parts of the world, which have resulted in human disaster.
Like its same virus, SARS-CIV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CIV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms in the same way.
COVID-19, however, has a critical and mortality rate rather than SARS but is transmitted more and has more adults than wet and more men than women.
As a reaction to the rapidly growing number of new diseases, this article is trying to provide a timely and detailed answer to the subject of rapid research.
We will discuss basic factors concerning epidemiology, ethology, virology, testing, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this restoration will help in the mind and the elimination of the threat.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has turned out to be an unparalleled memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to live in their homes on vacation and for weeks thereafter because of the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is much like coronavirus (CIV) that caused a vascular respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CIV-2 World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and a related disease was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly throughout the country and in some 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged from the hospital and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the first public enemy and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/www.nc.lm.nish.giv/pubmed/), over 200 pages are printed regarding the COVID-19 of its vocabulary, epidemiology, etology, testing, and treatment from the first report on January 7, 2020.
This payment attempts to close the development of research on a new and rapidly improving subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COV - 19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MARS, 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far that we can avoid the causes of disease as well as the rest of the important questions.
CoVs commonly viewed as nonstogens that kill people, mainly responsible for 15 percent of common fever 4.
In this century, however, we have experienced two times with Pathorogenic strains, namely, SARS-CV and MES-CIV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to other countries that caused serious and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in written human history.
As shown at Death. Death.1, colonies of which had an unknown origin began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the order of CIV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death toll was reported at Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the plague spread rapidly into neighboring cities, states, and countries.
On January 20, the cooperation of health workers was reported, suggesting that human relations were possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed down and all public transport materials were set up.
On January 24, an early medical study reported that only 21 of the 41 patients whose conditions were confirmed had direct contact with the Wuhan ocean food market that was considered to be the first place to be the disease from an unknown source.
On January 30, the WHO announced the outbreak of global health emergency.
By the time of the report, disease has spread throughout China and in some 50 countries around the world (Death.2.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the outcome and the severity of the epidemic are unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a study of a number of 8,866 clinics involving 4,021 that were confirmed to be handling COVID-19 showed a more revised image of the epidemic (https: /m.wieix.q.com/ UlBI-X_HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhabdA).
SARS-CIV-2 has infected people of all ages, but mainly for 30-65 years.
At least half (47.7%) of the victims were over 50 years old, fewer than 20, and only 14 are less than 10.
SARS-CIV-2 has caused more men to be ill (0.531/ 100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grew in groups mainly in Hubei and near again.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average period of the seizure was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from beginning to death is 91.5 days (48-13 days).
The basic number of rebirths (R0) was 3.7 (95% C: 3,51-4.5), and the changed R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people involved rose rapidly before 23 Jan.20, which was like a major move period before the Spring Festival in China.
The death toll of confirmed patients was 1,.44% (95% C: 1,101,86%), and the changed death rate for all patients was 3,06% (95%: 2.2-4.59%).
The three main aspects of COVID-19 risk factors were sex (men), age (e.g., and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are part of a family of large hidden bacteria that contain one RNA emotional fiber.
It can be divided into four parts, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, namely, alpha and beta, unknown to humans.
Spike (S) of glycoprotein envelope adheres to the host of antsin-conceptions enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diaptilptives 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CV and MErs-CV, respectively, then a combination of the membrane.
The RNA gene is released from cytoplasm; after recombination of the virus, RNA of the gene that corresponds to glycoprotein and nuclecopysid protein builds up the enzymes containing vion, including the plasma cell to release the virus.
The sequence of the first SARS-CIV-2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CIV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CIV with 99.98% of the genes within 10 successive samples collected at the first crash, the Huan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CIV-2 is often more like SARS-CIV than MERS-CIV.
Using a microscopy for the transfer of electron, SARS-CV-2 particles were found in the most clear parts in the Epithelium of air pressure on humans.
ACE2 persons were found to be the SARS-CIV-2 parcel of SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV.
However, S SARS-CIV-2 is associated with an ACE2 of the human being more quickly than that of SARS-CIV, which is in harmony with the fact that SARS-CV-2 causes less serious reactions to patients than SARS-CV.
SARS-CIV-2 can also recreate a new protein produced by theorf3b and the output protein produced by orf8.
SARS-CV-2 may play a role in the bug process and may prevent IFS visibility; however, theorf8 does not contain any known background or active mode.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the ACE2-EM public obscenities building with a full height of 2.9 Å associated with the B0AT1 amino acid vehicle.
It was found that this interconnected, with open and closed buildings, was linked as a unit of AC2-B0AT1 and that the link of ACE2-BAT1 was able to combine two S proteins, which give evidence of the appearance of the CoV and the integration.
B0AT1 may be a medical device to suppress SARS-CIV-2.
Background and center organization
It is known that both SARS-CIV and MERS-CIV have been introduced from bats and passed on to humans by civet cats and cameras, respectively.
Comparing SARS-CV-2 with other coVs, bats are recognized as the root of SARS-CoV-2 as a new virus equals 96% and two SARS -CVX5 sacs from bacteria called bat's.
However, what did the virus do to help the virus cross the border between creatures so that it could infect humans is unknown, and the channel of transmission will still be clearly defined.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be the carrier of the virus from the bats to the people that involved the recombination of the same elements within S protein.
According to research, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolin - with long noses, ants that are commonly used as Chinese human medicine — they may be the central SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of 99% of the genetic factors derived from pongolin and SARS-CV-2.
However, the 1% scattered between the two genes makes a great difference; hence, the sure results of strong female stability are still in store (Death.33).
The elements of SARS-CIV-2 major physics are not currently known.
SARS-CIV and MERS-CIV can survive outside the creature for 48 hours in a dry area and up to 5 days under 20 ° C and 40% 50%.
SARS-CIV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CIV-2 reportedly disagree with ultraviolet radiation and the temperature of 56 ° C for 30 minutes; the output, 75% of ethanol, an antibiotic with chloroperic acid, chloroform, and other substances, but not chlorhexidine, can cause the virus to function successfully.
Usually all people lack immune defenses against SARS-CIV-2 and that is why they are at risk of contracting a new virus.
At present, no detailed research has been reported on the response of SARS-CIV-2.
Therefore, we can refer only to previous studies of other CVs, especially SARS-CIV and MERC (Death.4.4).
Usually, after the virus invades the body, it is first seen by the body’s natural receptors (PRRs) that include creceptors like C type C, elptorlike receptor (TLR), NOR (NLR), and receptor like IG (IRR).
By different means, the virus causes an indication of inflammation, the development of dendritic cells, and the production of interferons of I (IFS) that trigger the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage pagocytics of the virus.
However, N SARS-CIV protein can help the virus to escape the immune response.
In the near future, the immune system joins the immune system.
T lymphocytes involving T T cells of CD4+ and CD8+ play an important role in protection.
CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce immune cells, as well as CD8+ T cells that directly kill infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatomine cytokine to help protect the immune cells.
However, CIV can stop the function of T cell by producing apoptosis for T cells.
The inability of the hummingbird, including such aids as C3a and C5a and immune response, is also important in the fight against bacterial infection.
The immune system taken from a healthy patient, for example, makes MARS-CIV inactive.
On the other hand, overuse of the immune system creates a large number of radar in an area that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the most extreme cases, multiple organs and even deaths.
SARS-CIV-2, with a group of first factors, has a higher risk of illness for adults with corordicitis as well as for pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to large amounts of bacteria or who have an immune system to develop higher resistance than other humans.
The measure of the cause of the SARS-CoV-2 detection period is 1,14 days, often 3-7 days on the basis of the study of the first 425 people in Wuhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 persons shows that the period of seizure was 3 days on the average and had a width of 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the period of seizure was 4.8 days (4.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 people.
It is very important for health authorities to change the time of the siege based on an accurate period of quarantine, by which victims are prevented but who have no symptoms to pass the infection on to others.
As is common practice, people exposed, or infected, need to be locked up for 14 days.
Should the time of imprisonment be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually a major and first symptom of COVID-19, which may not be associated with symptoms or symptoms such as nausea, lack of breath, muscle pain, rashes, headaches, sore throat, gonorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients suffered dyspnea and/or hypoxemia at the beginning of the disease.
In critical situations, patients made rapid progress with severe respiratory infections, poptic shock, metabolic acid, and coluopapathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even though there are no unusual items seen in the lung image, should be thoroughly screened for the virus to be tested at the outset.
A study of human knowledge conducted at the end of December 2010 indicated that 98% of symptoms were linked to fever, 76% of uncooked coughs, 55% dyspanea, and 3% of diarrheic disease; 8% needed to breathe with the aid of a machine.
Similar findings were reported on in two recent studies of a family group as well as a group of individuals who did not have symptoms.
By comparison, studies of human knowledge in 2012 indicated that MERS-CIV patients also had fever (98%), low cough (47%), and dyspanea (5%) as their principal symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed to breathe with the aid of a machine, much more than patients with COVID-19 and that corresponds to the highest rate of MARS killing than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (2%) and a severe throat (2%) were also noted for MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99% 100%), non-cancerous cough (99%75%), dyspanea (40%-42%), diarrhea (2-25%), and severe throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing with the aid of a machine was necessary for about 14%-20%.
On February 14, the death caused by COVID-19 was 2% of the total number of undiagnosed cases worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 are 10% of all diagnosed patients.
According to the MERS, based on a study of human knowledge in June 2012, death was 37% of the victims confirmed by 2,494.
The first survey reported that the R0 of SARS-CIV-2 was 6.47 with a DSI (CI) gap of 5.71-7.23, when the SARS-CV had a width from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CIV-2 with MERS-CIV and SARA-CIV with regard to their symptoms, deaths, and R0 is represented as Table of Table1.1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher rate of development than MERS-CIV and SARS-CIV, but it has less lethal power to kill both.
Therefore, it is far more challenging to manage the SARS-CV-2 epidemic than the MARS-CV and SARS-CV.
The starting point is often the same as a family or a similar gathering or an outinger.
Patients usually have a history of visits or live in Wunan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the next two weeks before the first.
It has been reported, however, that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and that hospital patients who have been discharged from the hospital can still carry the virus again, giving the warning to increase the time to stop.
Patients have a standard or limited number of white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes) in early stages.
For example, lymphopania has a number of white blood cells called <4×109/L], which includes the number of lymphocytes, called < 1×109/L, and higher levels of anaparate aminospherese and viremia found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of the liver and muscle and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte of the disease were high in the blood of most patients.
For patients with serious illness, D-Dmer’s level, the result of fibrin in blood loss, was high, and the lymphocyte rate was significantly lower.
An unusual find was found in the chest radography of many patients with COVID-19 and with the chemical properties of a double lung or gray glass in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from abnormal pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acupitory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid growth, and developing fibrosis endanger the gas exchange.
Depletion I-type and III/pneuccyte reduces surfactant level and increases space pressure, thus reducing the lung capacity to stretch and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst effects of radar are often similar to the critical condition of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first programological analysis of COVID-19 showed a rise in hyaucyte, the development of hyal membranes, and the development of interstitial lymphocyte, as well as the development of the intertwined synthesis in the patient’s lungs, along with the disease’s pathology and ADS and the same as in SARS and MES patients.
RNA of SARS-CV-2 using reverse-transcriptase palymerase channel reaction (IRT-PCR) was used as a primary subject for CEVID-19 testing.
However, because of a misdiagnosed number, which may cause an epidemic, medical appearance began to be used when screening (not only on the RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose when SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, medical evidence, laboratory tests, and the effects of radar are important and essential for successful testing.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team defined the SHERLOCK strategy based on the SARS-CIV-2, receiving non-commercial features of the RARS-CIV-CV-2 on 20 × 10-18/L to 200 × 10-18 mel/L (1010-18 copies on each input device) are used for a short period without the need for multiple devices.
We hope that a new approach will greatly improve empathy and benefits if it is confirmed in medical samples.
Because of lack of experience with new CIV, doctors can primarily provide support for patients with COIV-19, while attempting a variety of medical methods used or advanced in order to treat some of the sARS-CIV - CIV cases (Ithebula2).
This treatment includes current and potentially antiviral drugs, manmunouppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese drugs, and mental therapy.
Even a suggestion was made to use plasma for patients who were improving as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical firms compete for the immune system and goals against the virus.
SARS-CIV-2 attacks the lungs at the beginning and is likely to strike again, on a small scale, other body parts that indicate ACE2, such as a gestroinstinstinal and kidney.
Nevertheless, poor work and respiratory problems are a major threat to patients and are a major cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is important to reduce the symptoms and to save health and include general health care, high levels of oxygen flow, air ventilation without damaging equipment, and air installation are being used to cause serious physical damage to the body.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of extracorporal membrane oxygen (ECMO), an improved surgical surgical cadiopulmonary used to treat life-spiral or life - threatening heart failure.
In addition, storage of electronics, prevention and treatment for secondary involvements, and side effects, as well as prevention of essential body functions, are also important to SARS-CV-2 patients.
A cytokine storm is known as the result of an extreme reaction of the immune system to SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a reaction of the swelling program with the features of release of a division of the centokines, which includes TNF1, L1.2, LL-2, IL-6, FNYN
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release a large number of free - faiths that are the leading cause of ADS and the failure of many parts of the body.
Stress of the immune system is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially for terminally ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tolikizumabs, an anti-IL6 monoclal, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other immunological treatment of cytokine immune response includes the control of the immune system directed to T cells; the restriction of IFN-, IL1, and TNF; the name JAK; linnatumab; the pressure of the use of cytokine; and HDAC.
Steroids, such as ammunosuppressants, are widely used for SARS therapy to reduce the risk of inflammation.
However, steroids have not benefited from severe lung damage to SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecosis, which dramatically affects prognosis.
Even so, a short system of corticosteroids in low levels has been recommended to be used carefully for patients who are seriously ill.
By the time of the writing, no effective treatment against the virus had been established.
However, remdeviration, which is nucleotide anallog, was found to apply to an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesir is a new antibacterial drug that was first developed by Gilead to treat the diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg bacteria.
Later, remsividation also showed that it could prevent the RNA viruses containing one fiber, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China as a component to conduct research on SARS-CIV-2 cases, and the results are given red.
In addition, baribitinb, interferon-, plopinavir/ritonavivor, and libabilin have been elevated as a treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrheic disease, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after treatment combined with lapiavir/ritonavir.
The link between this treatment and other medications used by patients should be considered carefully.
Plasma from improved patients and immune systems
The collecting of the blood of patients from infectious disease to treat other patients of the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection is a longer history.
In fact, patients who are healthy usually have a high rate of immunity against their blood - borne disease.
The immune system is the immune system (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other unnecessary substances in the body and can detect different cells from disease and render them ineffective.
Based on this, plasma was collected in the blood of a group of patients who recovered on COVID-19 and was submitted to 10 patients in a critical manner.
Their symptoms were improved in 24 hours, which were accompanied by reduced inflammation and levels of the virus and improved levels of oxygen in the blood.
However, confirmation and explanation are needed to make the proposal that the way is widely used before any treatment is improved.
In addition, when considering the side effects of treatment, some of the side effects related to plasma should be considered carefully.
The immune system, for example, can greatly encourage immune response and cause cytokine liberation, which may be a life - threatening danger.
The immune system is usually low, and the need for plasma is greater if patients are seriously ill.
It is difficult to build and produce specific defenses too quickly to prevent a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and logical to distinguish B cells from healthy patients and to note genetic codes that have active genes or are carefully examined by the body’s active antibodies to represent important proteins of the virus.
In this way it is possible to increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
Its effects, however, are largely dependent on the combination of many parts in a wide range of forms based on the diagnosis based on the TCM view.
Most of the active parts are always unknown or clear as it is difficult to pick and confirm such parts or components that work best.
In the meantime, because of the lack of effective and positive treatment of COVID-19, TCM has turned out to be one of the major treatments for patients with lower symptoms to the middle of those who are recovering from serious side effects.
For example, Shuh Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen pills were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for patients with COVED-19 were identified in many Chinese states using TCM to 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei state, who used TCM, about 30 percent of its patients with COVID-19, had a very low recovery rate (13%).
However, this is an inaccurate comparison as other factors related to the number and seriousness of patients should be taken into consideration.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study to compare western medicine (WM) alone with a combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for the body's temperature to heal, the symptoms, and hospitalization were short for the WM+TCM group alone.
More impressively, the severity of symptoms (from small to serious) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and death was much lower than the WM+TCM group (8% compared with 39%).
Even so, TCM operations and security are still awaiting well - supervised research at many levels and facilities.
It may also be interesting that the approach approach is noted and that effective parts of TCM treatment or combinations are available if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are often more afraid of a highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who are confined to bed again are lonely, lonely, and angry.
In addition, such withdrawal symptoms as fever, hypoxia, and coughs as well as serious side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids may lead to increased anxiety and depression mentally.
In the first phase of SARS, a number of psychiatric disorders that include chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental retardation, schizophrenia, mental illness, mental illness, and even suicide attempts were reported.
A strict code of communication and close contact, such as part of the public health response to COVID-19, may cause many people to feel anxious and guilty about the effects of colliding, closing, and sealing in the family and their friends.
As a result, mental health care should be given to patients with COVID-19, suspected of having it, with people in contact with it and the general society that needs it.
Mental help should include the development of mental health factors in many fields, a clear and constant and accurate link with SARS-CV-2 in connection with the development of SARS-CV-2 and the use of electronic devices and programs to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are essential to break off the chain of connections between animals and people with whom they can be exposed and often harmonize with antibiotics in controlling new microbes.
Efforts have been made to make goals based on S protein to create long - term and potentially deadly defenses and/or prevent SARS-CV deficiency.
The goals of losing power have been studied in animals with regard to SARS.
However, these biological applications of the goals for adults as well as the death - dealing test models as well as their protection against the introduction of a virus from animals to humans are still to be discovered before medical research begins.
This is because SARS has been silent 17 years ago and no new disease has been reported since.
On the other hand, rare conditions and meRS groups continue to come from the Middle East and are spread in other regions as a result of the persistent transmission of viral sources from animal sources into humans in disease areas.
Preventive techniques have been developed for MERTS by using a noninfected virus, DNA plasma, microorganisms, nenoparticles, microbes, and lower - protein proteins and others have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and active goal against SARS-CIV-2 people is an urgent and vital task in controlling an epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to resist difficulties because of the long period (the average of 18 months) required to form a goal and the changing form of CV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just started to show its program of full medical treatment in thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients are able to recover a degree without the effects of the previous illness.
However, as with SARS and MES, COVID-19 is also linked to a high rate of sickness and death in patients with serious illness.
Therefore, building a model for the cause of the disease is essential to health care systems for initialization of their services, especially in areas of small resources.
Based on current medical research, the following factors may be affected or linked to the cause of COVID-19 patients (Her3):
Age: Age was the most important aspect of SARS cause, which is also true with COVID-19.
COVID-19 appeared primarily at 30-65 age, and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in a study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients in need of specialized care were more prone to other diseases and disorders and were significantly older than those who did not have (66 years compared to 51), suggesting that age is a factor in the effect of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CIV-2 has affected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Diseases already present and complex: COVID - 19 patients needing critical care have a higher chance of suffering serious heart injury and rhrythmia.
Heart - related events also became a major cause of SARS deaths.
SARS-CIV-2 is also reported to be able to adhere to ACCE2-position of a kWD, which may lead to liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is good to note that age and disease already associated with firmness and may be disturbing to one another.
Abnormal levels of C-rective protein (CRP) in the blood indicate the risk of swelling or muscle damage and has been raised to be a potential cause of illness, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
Recompliance of the CRP level and critical of the cause of COVID-19.
In addition, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), apartate aminosphere (ST), analine aminospherese (ATT), and creatine kanase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in many organs, especially heart and liver, and are released during muscle injury.
As a result, they are common symptoms of heart and liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: chest rayography and temporary progress of treatment symptoms should be considered along with other problems for forecasting side effects and complex COVID-19 problems.
The use of steroids: As described above, endoroids are often used as a treatment for increased infections to reduce the risk of inflammation.
With the widespread use of corticosteroids for patients with critical SARS, most survivors were suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with a lifelong disability and a poor quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low rate and a short time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID - 19 many patients suffered as much stress as they had to endure long periods of isolation and extreme uncertainty and to see the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Mental - health counseling and long - term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and to return to normal health.
In accordance with human knowledge studies up until now, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological features different from SARS.
In addition to resuscitation, SARS-CoV-2 can easily multiply in the above respiratory system and cause little or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, as do the CVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients associated with the first stage or period can produce a large number of bacteria during daily activities, which cause much difficulty in the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CIV transmission was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, while most of the interventions did not occur in the first grade.
As a result, the explosion of COVID-19 is more critical and difficult to control than the SARS explosion.
There are many current efforts in China that include the closing of the Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued closing of the total population in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CIV-2.
Although these measures have caused great economic and social damage in other parts of the world, the number of new cases is declining, which indicates a reduction in the rate of epidemics.
The most promising scale is that the outbreak will end in March and the rate of decline will continue for 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, are skeptical.
Paul Hunt, e.l., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more related than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of an epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may hold two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 were found in both the mid-turbine tubes and the patients ’ tubes that recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may have been a frequency phase similar to the influenza virus.
However, the promising signals come from China based on a drop in the number of sick young people, which indicates that current strategies may be effective.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would affect one million people and half a million people would die.
However, because of strict restraint and isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
It may be, such as SARS-CIV-2, that SARS-CIV-2 may be weak and eventually disappear or become a relatively resistant virus capable of human contact.
A comparison of the COVID-19 and the SARS epidemic is given below (DA.55).
SARS-CIV-2 is closely related to coughing or sneeze, and it may be through direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was rediscovered in the wild again, giving rise to a new chance of transfer from the wild to the mouth.
A recent study of 618 patients reported that 41% of the patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 cases of other diseases in the past and 40 health - care providers.
Hence, great care must be exercised to protect individuals, especially health - care professionals, family members, neighbors, even people who live near or vulnerable.
The first line of defense that may be used to reduce the risk of exposure is to wear face masks; both the use of surgery masks and the M95 respirators (an array # 1860s) help control the spread of germs.
The surgical masks block the liquids from a person who may have been exposed to air and clinging to things, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, N95 scans (an array # 1860s) can only protect you from taking small viions by 10 to 80 m, while only 5% of the virions are able to pass through completely; SARS-CV-2 has the same size as SARS-CV both.
Since vibrations can pass through five combined surgical masks, health personnel and patients must wear N95 masks (a series # 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health - care surgeons should wear well - suited protective helmets in order to reduce the risk of infection.
Microbes can enter a person’s eye.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was introduced to SARS-CoV-2 though she was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered her body by entering her eyes and waking up.
As a result, surgeons should also wear masks that cannot be shown or mirrors when working with patients.
In a society that is generally affected or may be affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay in the home to close up and keep in touch with people who may be involved.
The three - step stage is considered the right distance from the patient.
These measures are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and to prevent the spread of infection.
Although SARS-CIV-2 came as a new virus in the world of the people, her having a construction similar to SARS-CIV as reported on January 7, 2020 should have been a warning to China because she still remembered the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020 the director of the Center of Disease Control at Wuhan assures citizens that the new virus has little in common and is less developed when it leaves one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
The message makes the public safe, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they missed the critical time to control the virus while it was still in Wuhan.
Chinese disease controlers may learn from this crucial lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these addresses should (1) be more careful when making public declarations as each name is important to the citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from the clinic instead of waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more limited in order to control what may be the epidemic in its first phase instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) often perform social - controlled and working services to improve public awareness of diseases and to improve the degree of the public health care and at certain times.
COVID-19 outbreak caused by a new SARS-CIV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and in some 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is much like SARS-CIV and the symptoms are also similar between COIV-19 and SARS, the explosion of COVID-19 creates the feeling that SARS is repeating.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important to control the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more people who are older than younger and more male than women, and it has a higher mortality rate and a higher mortality rate among older people than in youth.
SARS has a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.1% compared with 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients pass the virus even when they have no symptoms while SARS patients pass it on when they are very ill, causing a much greater control of CEVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CIV-2 has increased faster and wider than SARS-CIV.
A general RNA assessment of SARS-CIV-2 may be fatal to some COVD-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who are treated may also become more active when they are tested with a virus.
The findings greatly increase the risk of infection.
With rapid progress in a COVID-19 research, there are a few major problems that need to be solved, including:
Where does SARS-CIV-2 originate?
Although it found that there are 96% similarities of the genetic structure between SARS-CoV-2 and two bacteria like SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CV-2 is derived from bats.
Which animal in the center passed the virus from the first organization, say bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers in #1 and 2, we can't successfully terminate the transfer, and the jump may be worse at any time.
While cell models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 clings to ACE2, how does the virus actually get into the cells of the respiratory system and cause changes that lead to the resulting disease?
Does the bacteria re - attach to the cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate examination of them, as well as effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do genes change during human relations?
Will it be a global epidemic, will it end like SARS, or will it occasionally become worse?
It is important but it may take some time to research the answers to the above questions and many more.
Regardless of how much it will cost, however, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to restore our health to the general situation.
The origin of the virus from animals to people of the coronavirus people
Change and flexibility have encouraged the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) with its organization, which includes people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two groups of people (HCVs) came to be known as a cause of minor illnesses, such as common colds.
The explosion of evasive respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MARS) has changed the situation to indicate how much damage HCV can cause and threaten life.
The appearance of SARS-CIV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 reputed the CVs on the stage and surprised us with a higher probability but with a reduced protocol compared with her sister SARS-CV.
HCV is ozone, and understanding the origin of HCV ozone could help us.
Many HCVs appear in bats and do not cause disease in them.
Non-integration of other HCVs is also known.
Animalization has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the behavior of the CV organization on animals may produce important insights about the development of the CV in humans.
In this return, it introduces the already available information about the seven HCVs, and we will focus on the history of their discovery and its origin of the ozone layer and the interconnection of various species.
More important, we compare and distinguish different HCVs from the view of mutations and genetic integration.
The current AIDS CV (COIV-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful resuscitation as well as the effects of changing the virus into serious disease are also magnified.
The Coronavirus (CoVs) is part of the Coronatritidae family, which is made up of a closed, self-obtainable, single RNA family.
These bacteria contain the largest of 26 to 32 microbiases between the RNA bacteria called "CoVs" because of their morphology similar to under the electron microscope.
According to a building, CVs have non-intermediate parts that do not have the same order.
About three parts of the genome have two hundred large learning frames (orF1a and OrF1b), translated to be ep1-polyteins and p1b.
Polyproteins are further tested to create 16 more non-booted proteins, called mp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome containsorF proteins for the building, including stike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of helpful proteins related to the list also has a code of different CV ranges.
Based on the variety of proteins, CVs are classified in four categories (alpha-Cov, beta-CV, mama-CV and delta-CV), where the beta-CV range contains the majority of HCVs and is divided into four columns (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenic evidence has shown that bats and mice are a source of the genes of the alpha-CIV and beta-CVs, while birds are the source of gamma CIVs and delta-CV.
For thousands of years, CIVs have progressively crossed the boundaries of nature and most of them have become important to humans.
So far, seven of the people's CVs (HCVs) are known.
Between them HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are the Alpha-CIV.
Other five beta-Covable beta-C43, HCCWO1, super-projector form of respiratory cornavirus (SARS-CIV), the Middle East respiratory system cornavirus (MERS-CIV) and SARS-CIV-2.
HCV-29E, HCV-OC43, HCV-Hkuku1 and HCV-NL63 often cause small symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CIV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-CoV-2 cause serious illness, resulting in a serious lower respiratory infection in too many patients that create a higher risk of a form of a form of hyperactivity syndrome (ARDS) and other non lung infections.
The first type of HCV-29E, B814, was separated from normal fever cases during the mid- 1960s.
Since then, additional information was obtained about the detailed studies of HCV-29E and HC43, which are both of the resulting symptoms.
In fact, the idea had been accepted that HCV treatment is usually safe until the spread of SARS.
The spread of SARS in 2003 is one of the most sad events of modern history, affecting more than 8,000 people and had a mortality rate about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the turbulent Arabian Peninsula that occurs from time to time in other parts of the world.
New HCIV (2019-nCov), later named SARS-CoV-2, is a continuing cause of the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which kills more than 3,120 people and is responsible for more than 91,000 people on March 20,20.
Alam has been crying and the world should be ready for the coming SARS-CIV-2 epidemic.
All seven HCVs have a source of ozone from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
The majority of evidence supports the origin of all HCVs from bats, where bacteria adapt well to the environment and do not cause disease but indicate a wide variety of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has set up major medical, scientific, social, and environmental challenges in China and the world.
A study of the origin of HCVs provides a framework of understanding natural history, the forces and aspects of the conception of creatures.
This can also guide or assist in foreseeing the cause, the internal, and the development of the SARS-CIV-2 animal-divi-2, which will have a major impact on future transmission.
In this receptor provides a brief outline of the root of the ozone layer, the combination of different species, and the HCV interferons.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the same field that the HCV parent bacteria are usually not a cause of illness in their natural organization but are causing illness after a combination of different creatures with a new organization.
We also repeat the process of HCV when the growth of links usually comes in with a fall of a process of processocinity.
The effects of the continuing SARS-CIV-2 are discussed in this context.
Animals CoVs have been known since the late 1930 ’ s.
Before the first group of HCV-29E type B814 came from the noses of patients who had a common cold, separate CVs were separated from various animals, including galaucoma, rats, cattle, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCVs in sequence (The Table 1) may benefit and teach.
The first type of HCV-29E was separated from the respiratory system of patients who had air-cushional respiratory trouble by the year 1906, and was accepted to develop in the lines of WI-38 lungs.
Patients with HCV-29E had common cold symptoms, including severe headaches, sneezes, radiation and sore throats, and fever and coughs were seen in 1020% cases.
Later in 1967, HCV-OC43 separated the tissue from the tissue and the subsequent series in the brain of wet rats.
The aspects of HCV-OC43 treatment appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which was not disparityly in the development of other respiratory diseases such as influenza A and nanoviruses.
Both HCV-29E and HCC43 are scattered around the globe, and it is often associated during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the time to absorb these two germs is less than a week, after about two weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people with HCV-229E suffer from a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with depression indicated that they had a serious respiratory disorder below.
SARS, also known as "a strange pneumonia", became the first epidemic caused by HCV recorded in human history and is the SARS-CIV cause of SARS-CIV, the third HCV discovered.
The first SARS illness can be traced to the end of 2002 in China Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spread throughout many countries and continents.
Apart from the major outbreaks, it was estimated that each incident could cause at least two other cases, during a four - to 7 - day receptor, and the rise of the virus occurred on the 10th of the illness.
SARS-CIV patients initially seemed to suffer from salgia, headache, fever, malaria, and flu, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory pressure as later symptoms.
lymphophenia, faulty liver examinations, and even high - techcretine are among the most common conditions for SARS.
The spread of aaveular damage, the epolial tubes, and an increase of macrophages are marked in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients need critical care and machine installation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many parts of the body that involve a gamma system, liver and kidney may also be associated with these critical conditions, often associated with cytokine storm, which may kill especially patients with antibodies.
The virus was first isolated from open lung surgery by a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much effort has been made in connection with HCV research.
HCV-NL63 was separated from the 7-month Dutch child towards the end of 2004.
First it was discovered that it was growing in small children, older patients, and patients who had a respiratory infection.
Conryza detection, conjunctitis, fever, and bronchiolitics are common in HCV-NL63.
One independent study explained the separation of the same virus from the vaginal tube of an eight - month - old male with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Though discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually spread throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCV-NL63 represents about 4.7 percent of normal respiratory infections, and its higher rate occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCV-NL63 is associated with obsctive laryngatis, also known as scup.
In the same year, HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old male who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from the common hormones and bronchiolitics, HCV-Hkuku1 is reported to be related to acate asthmatic acidation.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing lower respiratory infections.
All these HCVs found in society are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to change to be pathogenic diseases, although accidents occur for reasons unknown as in the rare case of the most lethal form of HCV-NL63, reportedly causing a serious respiratory respiratory disease in China.
Usually, when these HCVs acquire the ability to absorb easily and maintain themselves progressively within humans, they also kill or become less resistant.
MERC-CV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60 - year - old patient who suffered severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the conditions guaranteed by the laboratory are from the Middle East, the conditions installed are spreading to nearby victims reported in various countries of Europe and Tunisia.
One second outbreak took place in South Korea in 2015 with established 186 cases.
The appearance of MERS treatment is similar to that of SARS, which is marked by a growing serious virus.
In contrast with SARS, many MERS patients suffered severe kidney failure, which is currently a different thing from MARS among HCV diseases.
Over 30% of patients have gestroinstinstinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by the laboratory with high mortality rates in 34.4%, resulting in MERS-CIV one of the most dangerous bacteria in humans.
From mid- December 2019 to its end, many cases of pneumonia known as SARS-CIV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Provence, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of sARS-CoV-2 as the Public Health Emergency System that should affect the World Health Organization and named the disease COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, there were reportedly 90,053 cases worldwide, with 3.4% death rates.
Significantly, the number of deaths in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the other outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CIV-2 causes a serious respiratory disorder such as SARS-CIV and MERS-CV, which has been exposed as fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Patients also have diarrhea.
Hormone is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into a vasectomy syndrome.
Although SARS-CIV and SARS-CIV-2 are nearly identical because of the same high - nucleotide sequence of 82%, there are different groups in the phylogenic tree branches.
SARS-CIV-2 appears to be a relatively small processogenic but is closely related to SARS-CV and MARS-CV.
There are reportedly people who have no symptoms of SARS-CIV-2 and may have an impact on its rapid increase worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CIV-2 with six other HCVs points to the most interesting variety.
First of all, the duration and duration of HCV is much the same.
In this regard, SARS-CIV-2 follows the standard number of six other HCVs.
Second, the risk of CEVID-19 is between SARS-CIV and four HCIVs found in society (which is HCV-299E, HCV-OC43, HIV-HCU1 and HCV-NL63).
SARS-CIV-2, on the other hand, shows factors that are often seen during the public transmission of HCVs, which include a lack of clear symptoms, slight symptoms or symptoms.
On the other hand, a lower set of COVID-19 critical conditions can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CIV disease, although the rate is low.
Third, the SARS-CIV-2 link has also shown interesting patterns with both HCV features found in society and SARS-CIV.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-CIV-2 is as high as that of the HCVs received in the community.
On the other hand, it is still going to be determined whether the transmission of SARS-CIV-2 will decrease in people as in SARS-CIV and MERC environment.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-CIV-2 can be found in samples in the wild.
Whether an SARS-CIV-2 oral transmission plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CIV under certain circumstances will still be made clear by future research.
It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will reflect the appearance of certain seasons of the year as are those of HCVs in the community.
Nevertheless, SARS-CIV-2 features involving its integration, protocol and maintained expansion after human passage will have a bearing effect on the final conclusion of a continuing COVID-19 eruption.
All HCVs found in society cause small signals to fit in well with people.
According to one view, it may also be true that people have adapted well to these four HCVs.
In other words, both may have survived the plague of ancient HCOV.
HCVs cause serious diseases in people and people with HCV serious HCVs still exist.
To this end, HCVs must return to humans to sufficient extent to allow for the growth of changes in accordance with conditions opposed to the characteristics of the organization's recovery.
In this way, if the SARS-CIV-2 outbreak continues and is contributing to more people, it will be more likely to become more cooperative.
If they are highly compatible, human involvement may be difficult to prevent by closing off or by other means of control.
Over the years, four CVs have been found in the society that surrounds human society, which causes general fever in people who have the right immune response.
These bacteria do not need a source of animal life.
In contrast, SARS-CIV and PS-CV in most procedures are not well matched and their internal interaction cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow up at their source of ozone and need an opportunity to pass on to vulnerable victims, likely with one or more medium and to be raised by strangers.
SARS-CIV-2 has similar features as well as both SARS-CIV/MERS-CIVs and four HCIVs found in society.
It is more closely related as HCVs found in society, at least in the first creature.
However, Pathogenic is much greater than HCVs found in the community and has a narrow protocol in SARS-CIV or MERS-CIV.
It is still to be seen whether they will fully adapt to humans and move around without the source or the center of the animal.
Before discussing the origin of HCVs, it will help to discuss the descriptions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, source, middle and hosting HCVs.
The animal becomes a host of HCV changes when we lay on the closely related ancestor shared with her by high homology at the rate of the nucleotide sequence.
The virus is usually highly cooperative and does not cause spread infection in the developing world.
Similarly, the source organization carries HCV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, strangers are naturally infected and are not the natural host of HCV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCV is renewed to the central or early stage of human development, it is not well suited to the new organization and often causes sickness.
This inner layer may be a source of ozone in humans and play a role in raising the virus that allows it to multiply for a short period of time and can be passed on to humans to increase human exposure.
HCV can be faced with the final connection if it is not able to maintain its connection within the middle organization.
On the contrary, HCVs are able to adapt to the central unit and even develop long - term chemistry.
In this condition, the central vibrations become a natural source of moisture.
A epidemiological data showed that when viewed back as a SARS symptom patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent studies of seroprevalence showed that animal traders had a high SARS-CIV value compared with the average population.
Masked palm licvet (pambro larvata) and racoons of animal markets were found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CV that are almost identical to SARS-CV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS was reported after the execution of all market civets.
It has been reported, however, that the masted Palm civets in the wild or on the unexploded farms of animal stocked animals were so deadly as to SARS-CIV, suggesting that the masked palm civet may be a middle - class but not a natural source of SARS-CV.
Significantly, 80 percent of Guangzhou's various market animals have immune systems against SARS-CIV, we cannot ignore the possibility that most mammals are the breeding host of the SARS-CV.
All of these appear to be the last SARS-CIV receptors.
A study followed by the SARS-Cov's natural animal identified the CoV closely related to the bat, called SARS-rectated Rhinolopus Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Batcov HKU3), which is found in the roebis.
These beetles are particularly sensitive when it comes to the immune system against SARS-CIV and the genetic code of SARSr-Rh-BatCIV HCU3.
This as well as other fly-Cubics equals 88-92% of nucleotides and SARS-CV.
These studies led to the development of a new idea that bats could catch up on people's new Pathogens.
CoVs such as SARS (SL-CIV) are marked in bats, but none other than those called WWV1 can be classified as a living virus.
People's anteotenin conversion 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CV hosts.
WIV1 taken from the sewage of bats was shown to use bats, civet and ACE2 people as an assignment to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the sac of healthy SARS was able to kill WIV1.
Thus far, WWV1 represents the closely related SARS-CV patriarche to the bats, sharing 95% of nucleotide-comology.
Although there is an elevated homology between these two bacteria, WIV1 is generally believed to be not the nearest SARS-CV virus and the bats that were a nearby SARS-CV organization.
Proclamation of phylogenic consists of MERC-CV and the same channel for CV-HBU4 and coV-HDU5.
CV-HCU4 of the bat and MERS-CV use the same organization's host, diaptil popping 4 (DP4), in the transmission of the virus.
The RNA series of RNA based on the RNA of MARS-CV is closely linked with the physiogenical-CIV-beta-CIV-CV partners discovered in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CIV is found in wild bats.
MERS-CIV and its close relative CoV-HBO 25 bat share only 87% of nucleotide-comology.
As a result, bats may not be a nearby source of MERS-CIV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the hydromediate camels are used to protect the body directly from the self-containing system of MARS-CV, like camels native to many countries of Africa.
A living MERS-CIV virus was separated from a motorized camel tube, which further showed that camels are a real source of MERS-CV.
It is also noteworthy that small symptoms were often observed, but major releases of the virus are linked to the MARS-CVs according to research.
Significantly, the accompanying camels release bacteria not only by respiratory means but also by the mouthway, which is also the main means of decomposition from bats.
However, questions remain, since most MerRS diseases do not have a history of communication with camels before the beginning of symptoms, it is possible that the relationship from man to another or unknown interconnectional connections involving the unknown animals who carry the MERS-CV.
SARS-CIV-2 shares with 96.2% of nucleotide-CV RATG13 bat separated from the receptors at Rhinolopus afinins.
As is the case with SARS-CIV and MERS-CIV, the differences between SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 are too large to be assigned to parent relations.
That means, bats may have had a nearby sARS-CIV-2 source unless they were discovered about the same sizes in the future.
It is thought that non-submarine SARS-CoV-2 must be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huan Seafood Wheele Market, the majority of them were related to the first COVID-19 illness, which indicates that there may have been an event from animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may be responsible for adult beta-CIV-CIV-CIV-2.
These new gengolin CIVs equals 85-92% of nucleotidism and SARS-CV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 by approximately 90% of the nucleotide sequence.
They combine to two subgroups of bacteria similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenic plant, one of which shares the background of the closely related host (RBD) and SARS-CV-2, with amino acid sequence of 9.4%.
In sharp contrast, the RBDs-CIV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, though there is a high rate of homology.
An earlier study of sick pangolins reported the discovery of bacteria in lung samples, which appears to be related to SARS-CIV-2.
The study used various construction methods as well as hand - made schemes to form a chain chain made up of approximately 86.3% of the total length of the virus.
We cannot set aside the opportunity for the pangolin to be one of the nearby SARS-CIV-2 nearby nearby animals.
At present, however, there is no evidence to support that pangolin is a direct source of SARS-CV-CV-2 due to the variations between SARS-CIV-2 and SARS-CIV-2 of the pangolin related beta-CV.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CIV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter between SARS-CIV-2 and SARS-CIV-2 of the beta-CV.
SARS-CIV-2 on bats, pangolins and other mammals are still to be found.
While high-ordered homology has been found in RBDs-CIV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CIV-2 related to beta-CIV, SARS-CV-2 and RaTG13 share a high-compression strategy of widespread schedule.
There are high assumptions that the high rate of similarity between the RBDs-CIV-2 of the beta-CIV and SARS-CIV-2 interconnection-covational-action.
Another recommendation recommends a reunition of SARS-CV-2 of the quadolin related to beta-CIV and RATG13 on the third wild animal.
As a force behind evolution, reuniting is widespread among beta-CIVs.
The conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the nearest SARS-CIV-2 ozone source.
Without major HCCVs, the source of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCHCU1 is also investigated.
Phylogenic evidence has shown that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-2229E may have started with the batics, while the parent bacteria of HCV-OC43 and HIV-HCU1 have been found in rats.
It is reported that ARCV.2 (Apparachian Ridge CoV), found on a three - color North American reef, reportedly showed close contact with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-29E was a genetic link with another bottle code, called the Hippoporoderos/Ganakwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, while the calciums have been suspected of its immediate organization.
To clarify it, the current information about the origin of known HCV animals is summed up in Picture 1 and Table 2.
A study of phylogenics has provided evidence of the links between HCV creatures in history.
When HCV-OC43 from another animal to be passed on to humans came from domestic animals about 1890, an epidemic of respiratory disease was recorded.
The history of the cooperation of HCV-29E creatures is not very clear.
A related HCV-229 E.
Among them is the alpha-CIV of the apaca.
A few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
For one thing, humans and not the Alpacas are more likely to communicate with bats in the same environment.
Rather, people are close to the apacas.
Second, the bacteria related to HCV-29E are different and do not cause illness in the bats, while alpaca’s alpha-CV caused an outbreak of respiratory infections in endangered animals.
Finally, the Alpaca alpha-Covy has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we will not overlook the opportunity for the Alpacas to receive the alpha-CIV related HCV-229E to humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of germs that cause human diseases involving the virus of the rabbis, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may have directly transmitted HCV-29E to humans.
On the other hand, when bats' alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic group of HCV-29Es, the aparacas and the hydrogen camel may be the central bactere that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MERC-CV.
MERS-CIV is a good example of the interaction of different species from bats to human camels.
The origin of MERS-CIV evolution from bats is known for its first diagnosis and confirmed by the following discovery.
It is evident that bats provide an opportunity for a exchange of genes between different animals and the interconnection of different animals.
Long health, crowded colonies, close social attachments, and the power of flying are all ideal conditions for bats to be a 'bacterial'.
On the other hand, MERS-CIV has been introduced for hundreds of years in a hydromediaary camel.
It is well suited to these camels and turns into the middle organization a stable and natural source.
MERS-CIV causes small illnesses and has a lower rate of changes on these animals.
Its interaction with people is a mistake and people remain the last structure of MERS-CIV since its transmission can be saved.
Contrary to the role of camels in MERS-CIV transmission, the role of pangolins, if available, in the transmission of SARS-CIV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-Covin beta-congulin causes more serious disease in the pangolins.
It may be the last collection of beta-CIV related to SARS-CIV-2, like civets in SARS-CIV environment.
A few possibilities for the interconnection of the SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or considered in future studies.
First, bats may be a bug source of the SARS-CIV-2 virus related to SARS-CV-2 similar to SARS-CV-2.
People may play a role similar to that of bats by operating on animals or collecting coal.
Second, pangolins may be a middle - class growth device where the SARS-CIV-2 virus is recently launched.
People are infected by surgical procedures and the eating of stolen meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be identified to SARS-CIV-2.
The immune system of domestic and wild animals needs protection.
Third, as mentioned above, the reunification and replacement of SARS-CIV-2 may occur in the third animal connected with both bats and pangolins.
Thinking of the SARS-CIV-2 animal is still in progress.
Apart from the different types of predatory, there are three major factors on the part of the virus that are important in making the CVs across the biological limit.
First, its maximum number of changes to the RNA multiplication.
Compared with some RNA viruses that have a single string, the average number of converters may be viewed as "small" to the "high" level of changes per year by each other type of 2 stations, depending on the co-compliance unit for new hosts.
CoVs have a search for errors, their removal results in a higher change and a decrease in strength or potential failure.
Interestingly, nucleotide is known to suppress the frequency of CV with the blockoculosis and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesir is one of the most promising scientists against SARS-CIV-2 that will be tested for medical research.
Nevertheless, the number of converters is about a million higher than those who did not know them.
Moreover, the number of changes is usually high when the CoVs are not properly in harmony with the organization.
Compared with SARS-CIV with a high number of changes, the number of changes SARS-CIV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a higher level of acceptance.
Supposedly, it may already have been agreed upon by another close human organization.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this applies to MERS-CIV, which fits well with the hydrogen camels.
It is thought that genetic mutations may cause viral goals and antibiotics against SARS-CIV-2 to be delayed.
Second, a large RNA frame in the CoV uses more softness in changing the logome to change and recombination, thus increasing the co-evolution of various creatures, which is beneficial to the appearance of new CVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a number of different frames of open learning and the function of protein produced by a 3
Third, permanent CVs change the profiles by randomly during the RNA repetitions in a different way of "copying" option.
In a system that works as a mixed device, change of type occurs regularly during the context of the CV RNA.
Too many homologous receptors with full length and subgenomics may be reunited to form new CVs.
Phycogenic evidence of natural reunification has been found in both HCV-Hkuku1, HCV-OC43, and animal covs such as the SL-CoV virus and BatCIV-Hkus9.
Bacterial co-ordination in connection with the infection
Besides the three aspects of the virus mentioned above, the connection between the virus and the virus’s host is another major factor affecting the interaction of different species.
Here, the reuniting of SARS-CIV is viewed as a common example, which shows evidence of a weak choice between the events of different species.
Based on a balanced analysis between separate people and SARS-CoVs in civet, SARS-CV is thought to cope with the rapidly changing situation for different hosts, especially with the change in S RBD for S protein protein.
Generally, RBD in the SCV project cooperates with the host and is strongly chosen by the organization's immune response.
In SARS-CIV, RBD is in 338 amino acids to 510 in the S1 component, which adheres to ACE2 of the person and its correceptors for the infection.
SARS-CIV is able to recognize the ACE2 responses of different animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon, which allows the virus to be infected by different creatures.
In fact, only 6 remnants of amino acids that were marked as different from the separateity of the human virus and the 4 civet on RBD are found in a ovarian who adheres to an ACE2 response.
CARS-CV has a K479N change and S487T to its RBD, which may increase the level of spike protein relationship with an ACE2 man's supply.
In other words, this change of two amino acids may be important to the transmission of the virus to humans.
Significantly, SARS-CIV-2 has the same vehicle as SARS-CIV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV in S1 unit of SS protein means that the level of S and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, a survey of clyo-EM shows a high level of 10-to-20 of this siege rather than between ACE2 people and S S S S S S SS-CV.
It will also be interesting to consider whether another correceptor is needed for the SARS-CIV-2 installation.
Interestingly, HCV-NL63 is also attached to ACE2 but with a different S component.
There are other HCV responses, such as aminoepide N in HCV-229E, and 9-O-acetyacted salic acid of HCV-OC43.
They may also be seen as a reason for the successful cocosion of the people after the combination of different creatures from their animal hosts.
In addition to the cells, the effect of the combination of the different species of HCV is also controlled by dependence on another creature and the characteristics of the limits.
The differences between humans and strangers who are the natural source of HCVs such as bats, dragonadaary camels, and rats may create a barrier between different species.
HCVs should take the aspects of dependence on the owner and interfere with the phases of the movement of the organization in order to bring successful harmony to living creatures.
In this regard, cell cells in this vital area dealing with the virus will be identified and identified.
The wide range of unrequested log configuration and SARS-CIV-2 audio content using the current CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCV breaks: initialization
The variety of bats shows many opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, bats crystals serve as a group of HCV genes.
In addition, rapid mutations and recombination of the genes also play a role in HCV evolution and serves as two important steps in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein code has the power to greatly change pheromone type.
Among sARS-CIV helpful proteins, theorF8 is thought to be important in human tolerance, since the bacteria related to the SARS-CIV are separated but found to produce differentorF8 proteins.
The aspect of the removal of SARS-CIV is derived from different types at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal splits the OrF8 into the OrF8a and the OrF8b and is thought to be a harmonious change that encourages the conversion of strangers.
Besides, SARS-CIV may have a history of reunification and ranges of alpha and gamma, where a large number of smaller meeting places were found in RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Reset positions were also found in unsp9, in the main part of Minp10, and in parts of unsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CIV epidemic experienced reunitive events between different rows, which occur on the camel in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CIV and MERS-CIV, reunitive events have been observed in some HCVs, where HCVs reunitive with other animals in their non-booted genes.
It should also be noted that the selection of choice may also have a hand in unregulated alterations in the viruses, which may result in freeing the bacteria from the agents used, such as those of the immune system.
An example of these results is the loss of ORF4 of full length in the HCV-29E type of protein, as a result of a double nucleotide removal.
While a completeorF4 was seen in the bacteria and camel related to HCV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CV shows a single nucleotide installation, leading to the change of frame.
Finally but most important, new HCVs are reactivated by the pressure of selecting their source users.
There were no signs or only small signs found when bats were introduced by the CoVs, showing the same harmony between the shows and the bats.
Ants seem to be well suited to the CVs as structure and operation.
For example, the interference in the use of analgesics that stimulates abiologic growth in bats easily reduces the pathology initiated by CVs.
Besides, the role of a natural killer in bats is stressed because of the rise in the response of the cell cell of the natural killer cell NKG2/CD94 and the low level of display of the complex histocompinentity of hiss.
In addition, the high rate of oxygen - response creatures (ROS) built on the task of eating high - food bats may affect both the stress of the return of the CoV and affect the diagnosis of error by the xorobbinosis, thus giving rise to the choice of forms of <thogenics) when introduced to a new organization.
High - tech strains of CV may also change by recombination, which leads to new proteins or protein components of the organization's coordination.
As a result, it is not uncommon for three new HCVs to come out two decades ago.
CoVs do not affect one another or cause little symptoms to their principal hosts, such as bats and camels.
They multiply quickly without encouraging a strict response to the immune system.
Here are the secrets of why signalsless carriers are identified and what is behind the critical conditions in human sickness.
Particularly serious symptoms are caused by the increased effectiveness of antibodies and cytokine storms when there is a strong reaction to the immune system, the damage of the lungs increases.
In contrast, for those who do not show symptoms of disease, the immune response has been divided twice to the infection.
The same method of detoxification of the immune system may have a beneficial effect on treatment against SARS-CIV-2.
The interferon response is especially strong to bats.
As a result, the use of I interferon in at least the first stages of SARS-CIV-2 people should be beneficial.
In addition, the use of NLMP3 inflammasome bats is useless.
According to this opinion, NLMP3 inflammasome prevention may be useful in the treatment of CEVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CIV-2 follows the general paragraph of the SARS-CIV development and MARS-CV.
While there has been a 9% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CIV, there is also a band of bats that shared 96% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CV-2.
While civets and other market animals have been found to carry viruses such as SARS-CIV, nearby SARS-CIV-2.
Pangolin beta-Covlines have the same structure as SARS-CIV-2, which indicates that the pangolins may be some of the non-inte-Covable non-CV-CV characters or the beta-CVs may have a hand in the last part of the SARS-CV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CIV-2 is man-made by purpose or error.
CoVs are returned to the theater because of the recent SARS-CIV-2 explosion.
A study of the coral reefs and other animals has greatly changed our view of the importance of the ozone layer and the sources of HCVs in human interaction.
The widespread evidence shows that SARS-CIV, MERS-CIV and SARS-CIV-CIV has a common origin and is passed on to humans by internal strangers.
Since SARS-CIV links from human contact with market civets, closing the stock market and killing civets could have completed the SARS epidemic.
In a similar vein, pangolins must be removed from biological markets in order to prevent ozone integration, considering the discovery of many rows of pangolin beta-Covin related closely to SARS-CV-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how SARS-CIV-2 is transmitted to humans by pingolin and other mammals will still be revealed in future tests.
On the other hand, MERS-CIV has been present for a long time in the hydrogen camel.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, honey, skin, and spices for local people.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all camels in order to take control of MERS, as happened in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CIV and SARS-CIV-2.
In order to prevent the frequency of MERS, a detailed approach should be used to set practical goals that are opposed to the camel-CIV, along with other steps to control disease.
Since we can’t eliminate these bacteria, new genotypes may appear to cause diarrhea.
The variety of zoos is spin in the wilderness.
Particularly, the ozone - rich ozone crystals are very varied.
There are many opportunities for these zoos to change and reunite, resulting in new conceivably close - knit and/or kill people in the future.
The custom of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned in order to limit unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS factors, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better method of preparation and response.
In fact, most microbes live on the earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have an opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many factors that promote the spread of bacteria, the opportunity for humans to communicate with bats and other wild animals can be diminished if people are taught to be remote from them.
Further care for mammals is needed to understand better the context of the code of coVsists, which will be helpful in preventing attachments from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent the ozone layer is to keep people from being away from the environment as natural sources of ozone.
A few sections of the SARS-CIV-2 ozone source have not yet been found.
First, if bats pass the SARS-CIV-2 to the pangolins, it will be beneficial to see what conditions bats and pingolin are not able to share the environment's common environment.
Second, if bats play a key role in human interaction, it should be observed how humans communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a real central centralized organization, the way we deal with various creatures involving humans, bats, and pangolins should be explained.
Finally, as many mammals as well as domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-CIV-2, both care and research intervention should be done.
If there may be a bat, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CIV-2 or its parentlike bacteria will be found in their natural organization in the future.
Further research on the site will explain the approach of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution system on animals, with important results in the prevention and control of CEVID-19.
A return of the subject of a "reproached" and the "notored" that they suffer from COVID-19 is needed.
On February 6, 2020, our team had published a quick set of advice for testing and treatment for the new colonavirus (2019-nCov), and the program provided our experience and the appropriate documentation to combat this global epidemic.
However, Coronavirus (COVID-19) new disease, alertness, and understanding increase based on continued research and medical experience; hence, testing techniques and treatments continue to be replaced.
In this book, we answered one comment about our lawyer and presented the subject of a new test for those who have been ‘ condemned ’ and "confirmed" that they are ill with Dagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 colonavirus (1919-nCIV) had caused outbreaks, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named after the respiratory system of respiration 2 (SARS-CIV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To meet the SARS-CIV-2 connection, our unit has established a method of rapid response and has been printed on the Internet in the Miltary Medical Research in 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since its publication.
Note, however, that COVID- 19 is a new disease, increased awareness and knowledge based on research and medical experience; hence, testing techniques and treatments continue to be developed.
For example, Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http: /www.hn.g.v.c., between January 1620 and 3 March 2020, it has published seven volumes when other things are significantly changed.
Our lawyer received notice from Zhou et al., giving a simple suggestion on points based on their experience.
Their work adds to the new evidence of our creator and makes valuable reference to this global epidemic.
We commend their valuable work and express our gratitude.
Their DO, however, needs to be rewarded in accordance with the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (The 7th edition of the research) and the latest research.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), to ensure the certainty of the diagnosis, it requires that any single substance of epidemiological history and two displays of treatment to make a general revision, or to meet three aspects of medical treatment that have no specific background in epidemiological:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of visiting or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which COVID - 19 is reported on in the last 14 days before symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people associated with SARS-CIV-2 (by a test of nucleic acid acids); (3) the history of contact with patients who suffer from malaria or breathing symptoms in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 are reported at the start of 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with many patients who are infected (two/or/oral symptoms in the center of school, school, school, school, and clinic).
Medical evidence: (1) fever once/ or breathing symptoms; (2) with the features of COIVD-19 image image; (3) total number of normal lymphocytes indicates the number of normal, low, or low in range.
A confirmed diagnosis should be based on one of the following side effects of conductgenic or servitological evidence: (1) a thorough PCR scan for the actual time period of the SARS-CV-2; (2) the complete chain chain chain of a virus that displays high-homogenity in the new coronavirus virus; (3) to be active with the direct immune system and the SARS-CV-2 protection of the SARSA-C2 in the screen; or the direct change of the environment of the IGG/CV-CV-CV2 virus, which has been called a positive attack attack attack attack, or a positive development of the next time.
We see that the actual time checking for PCR of the nucleus acid in the respiratory system or in the blood samples of the country in the second order (Janu 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Transogenic adoption of blood samples is extended in four tables (27 January 2020) and five (8 February 2020); and the iron evidence is installed in the seventh order.
These changes are based on the ongoing search for high - tech nucleic acid test, as well as the samples of the respiratory system, which increased the availability of different tissues, and supported the bringing of a severe side effect of the immune system into a confirmed case.
Besides, there is more evidence to remind us that we are cautious about patients who have unusual symptoms and who have no symptoms.
That is why, the Zhou et al flow chart should be paid back, since it refers to a person who has no symptoms "as at low risk."
The process of reasoning also requires constant confirmation at work and in medical courses.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and for the disciples to note.
In order to make an evaluation of the "disgraces" and "confirmed illness", we recommend that the new national methods be followed and sleeped in their home.
Our hold will also repay our rescuers for help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest number of day
Last night, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest case of the day caused by the virus.
Since yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a reported number of sick people are 114 and 33 righteous people sitting at home.
The total of 17 people who have died was recorded.
On the Internet media, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men as well as one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60 years old, two were between 55 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two were coming from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID- 19 is a disaster on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corrument Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in the Internet video proclamation, the Bangladesh Traffic Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will be closed longer than that scheduled, until this coming Saturday.
This ban on public transport had started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods -- for treatment, fuel and food is still approved.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, among two persons returning from Italy with one of them.
By March 19, these three are already doing so.
The number of SARS-CIV-2 is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, illness caused by corronavirus.
This occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus illness and Zambia had its first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea has said, beginning Thursday, it is one of the few countries where there is no corronavirus.
Last day, the World Health Organization introduced a valid 1,051,635 medical report, which includes 79,332 cases in twenty - four hours before 10 a.m. according to the Central European European (800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus diseases are recorded, associated with about 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, that there are more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday caused by corronavirus.
Around the world, countries have declared strong measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sovyan, a Moscow city, has extended the siege of the city to May 1.
Throughout the country, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russian people will continue to be led without work until April 30.
Portugal’s Parliament has decided to increase national emergency in 15 days; the vote is awarded 215 votes by votes, 10 votes, and one vote against this.
Saudi Arabia has the time to return to the home of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to continue throughout the day; previously, the time to return home was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use the return time between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The ruler of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has announced that the state has published its policy of living at home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the cost of buying small house paper for each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chain Wonkakaths and Coles cut down its limit of the purchase of toilet paper so that a person buys two and one pack in each store throughout the country, in turn.
ALDI also opens a limit of one pack on Monday.
These limits are displayed as messages to exit, and on Facebook pages of this store.
Buyers kept buying large quantities of it out of concern for COVID-19 if they had to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Wonkakaorths again has the purchase of a toilet paper for those who are brought home to be a single cooking pot with each order.
These changes follow the previous four-points of the four stations on each purchase of which Wokwrights and Coles were introduced in March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8 news statement, reported that with a limit of four clocks laid out, "Many stores are still losing goods about the hour of its import"", and called the need "no equal" "," while LDI, in its Facebook pastor on Tuesday, said "Unexpected"."
"Selling" has increased over the previous week, according to the Wonkweorths spokesman.
The Cestco store in Canberra also calculates the number allowed to be two zeros a week ago.
In order to deal with the demand, Coles has ordered the largest openings in the operation and also announced the increase in the delivery, Wokweorths has an extra container, while the LLD has made provision of the three-deopts that it is readily available.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that merchants are trying to raise the store, but the limits of the local council regarding the time of trucking make things difficult.
He expects the cost of production to increase, as surgeons try to meet the need, with a few carpets.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early release of the store, some stores could not keep up with a third click.
In a report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimemer, expert on marketing at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up the store regularly at night.
He pointed out that a small house paper is a heavy object, which leads to a low price for numbers, and, when completed, leaves a large space open, strengthening the feeling of devotion.
Coles and Workaorths have a view [that] if there were many things on the shelves, if a product like a small house - paper and a tie could be [sell Zimmerman's] and there is much, you would probably ease the fear, says Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The producer of the residual paper Who Who Who Gaves a Crap said on Wednesday and is out of shelter.
Kimberly-Clark, who created Klenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, stressed that they worked 24/7 to keep the product present, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a home sales site, reports that some houses vendors offer free paper to the first person attached to an organization in Melbourne, when a few annotations are being conducted because consumers have time to relax for a longer Labour Day weekend.
A Fourth edition of the NT News, a daily printed newspaper of Darwin, added a nine - page index intended for cut and used as a toilet paper.
Stores were at first reluctant to set limits, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3, when they said they had no plans to set limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a higher need, including minks, potatoes, dried foods, soaps, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the supermarket selling to the British Internet of Ocado was seen at an early stage buying Andrew's toilet paper so that it would be two of the 12 - wheeled cooking pot.
The World Health Organization calls COVID- 19 disaster victims
On the third day, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called a continuing COVID-19 — a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CIV-2 — plague.
"While the word "easion" refers to the extent to which the disease is affected, not in the way specific examples are dangerous, WHO has shown the need to care for the need to conduct governments in action: ""
All countries are unable to reverse the plague.
When countries investigate, investigate, are here, subdividing, following, and responding to population control, says Telos Adanon Gebreysus, WHO Director of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming and the formidable spread and the alarming lack of movement.
" According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epidemic "" has no previous parallel."
"He said, by noticeing what was announced to the CNN at February, "Out of the influenza," no other respiratory virus has been followed from birth until it spread the whole world." "
"Ghebreyus has produced a similar view, "We have never seen a plague removed by a coronavirus."
"He has continued," and didn't stand before we see an epidemic that can't be controlled at the same time."
The new epidemic situation follows the WHO's January decision to call a rash as a worldwide public health emergency.
"The U.S. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said with explosion, "" which remains, there will still be worse." "
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 dead.
The 2019 Coronavirus epidemic is a continuing epidemic of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CIV-2).
The outbreak of an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 was declared an international public Health Emergency on the Troubles in January 30, 2020, and was considered a plague on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, 1,661 million accurate models of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and limits, leading to 97,000 deaths.
Some 36,000 people have improved.
The number of examples of destruction has been estimated to 4% in China, at the same time round from 13.04% in Algeria to 1.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, coughing, and loss of breath.
Problems may include pneumonia and acupatory stress syndrome.
The time of exposure to symptoms usually last five days, but it can range from 2 to 14 days.
No known cure or treatment can defeat the virus.
Specialized safety measures include washing hands, brushing your mouth when coughing, keeping distance between others, and avoiding contact with people who suspect that they are vulnerable.
Authorities around the world have responded by setting limits on travel, division, movement, measures to control hazards in the workplace, and habitat closing.
This epidemic has led to serious economic and social upheavals around the world, changes or exposure to sports, religion, politics, and cultural events, as well as a dearth of the things needed to buy quickly.
Schools including citadels are closed up by the world or in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the total number of students worldwide.
False knowledge about the virus has spread to the Internet, and there have been cases of racial prejudice and discrimination among Chinese people, as well as other people from the Orient and backgrounds and of the countries of North Asia, and others from the lands with many examples of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in the amount of travel and closing of large industries, there is a reduction in air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions.
The health authorities of Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei region) have reported a series of cases of unknown pneumonia in December 3119, and the study was opened at the beginning of January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huan Seatun Seatle Market, so the virus is caused by the development of an animal from the beginning.
The virus that caused an outbreak is known as SARS-CIV-2, an emerging virus that is associated with the bottle - cronaviruses, pangolin cronaviruses, and SARS-CV. The first known person who showed the symptoms was later found to be ill on 1 December 2019, and that person never had a direct connection to the web mark.
In the first collection of examples reported in December 2019, three sections were found joining the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post raised that the example followed back to 17 November 2019, for a 55 - year - old Hubei district, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported, as new examples are reported in China but are growing slowly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new examples outside China’s first - year - old state.
There may be some reporting under examples, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, small examples had been reported among youths, those who were 19 and below made up 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief scientific adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Valley, who estimated to me 60% of British society, would need to be included so that an Effictive head immuniity could be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their tests confirm the certainty in terms of the law.
Since March 23, no country has investigated more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws against screening those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published in 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 links were not yet found, and this unwritten link is the source of 79% of recorded cases of disease.
A mathematical analysis published in March 30 estimated that the number of connections in Italy is much higher than the recorded examples.
The first average of a simple birth rate (RF) of COVID-19 of 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that there may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are improving.
Those who are not prepared, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, which are most commonly 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were set up as a reason for COVID-19.
In China, starting about 5 February 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% of the health problems already exist, which include heart disease and diabetes. The official death rates for COVID - 19 generally refer to those who have died under test as confirmed by the law.
The true COVID-19 death number may be too large, since it does not include every person who dies without checking - b. at home, at the elders' home, etc.
A data component from Italy found that the number of premature deaths during the epidemic exceeded the official death rates for COVID in 4-5x.
"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the released number of deaths] are below the limit"", a speech corresponding to the reports of anicdotal statistics below the U.S. similar to that of an epidemic, such as the H1N1 disaster in 2002. The first recorded death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020."
The first death occurred outside China itself on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death occurred outside Asia on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, countries and more than 40 countries had reported deaths, in all continents other than Antarctica. There are several steps that are often used to measure the rate of death.
These numbers vary from place to place, and are influenced by the magnitude of diagnosis, the state of health care system, the forms of treatment, the time of the onsets, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. The modeth-to-cateo shows the number of the dead and separates them with the number of examples tested during a particular period.
By supporting the figures for Johns Hopkins University, the global dath-to-case has been 6.0% (97,039/617,204) since April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China,  modeth-to-case modeo is down from 17.3% (for those with symptoms appearing on 1.10 January 2020) to 0% (for those with symptoms appearing on 1 February 2020). Some measures include catalytalityrate (CFR), which indicate that the percentage of people tested due to illness, and inition fatiguerate (IFR), which indicates that the percentage of participants (fected and not diagnosed) die due to illness.
These statistics are timeless and are followed by a number of individuals from the introduction to the model resolution.
A number of highly educated people tried to calculate the numbers of certain individuals.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Investigation-Based Medicine estimates that the entire infection risk is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher the level is in accord with the results of an unplanned COVID-19 survey in Germany, and statistics that assess the results of CFR tests.
WHO asserts that an epidemic can be controlled.
The true degree and duration of the eruption are either uncertain or very different.
"Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "If left unchecked, a conjugal eruption is reduced and began to decrease when the disease is lost by the guardians it can find."
"But it is almost impossible to make the guessing now as to when it will be."
"Chong Nonshan said "It may have been over June" if all countries can make an effort to follow WHO's Advn measures to prevent the spread of the virus."
"In 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropic Medicine spoke that SARS-CV-2 "will go around, with a strong force for one or two years"."
" According to the Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be required "until the solution is found (by washing 18 months or more)."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this corronavirus (because it is easily passed away" may also "become a season sickness, it returns again every year"."
Return violence will depend on the strong protection of the flock and the degree of changes
COVID-19 symptoms can be negative in one way or another, and infected people may have no symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, nausea and nausea in the chest (phlegm), loss of breath, loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cynosis. WHO has said that by not cutting, 1 person in 6 is seriously ill and has a respiratory problem.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list that shows symptoms of an emergency as difficulty when breathing, chronic pain in the chest or depression, anxiety in the privacy, difficulty in waking up, and the face of green or lips; rapid medical care is encouraged when these symptoms are present. The progress in this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, a form of hyperactivity syndrome, sepsis, epiticsk and death.
Some of those infected may not have symptoms, but their medical symptoms prove infectious, so researchers have given advice that those who have had close contact with the confirmed ones must be watched closely and hunted to ensure the absence of disease.
China's estimate of those who do not have symptoms range from a few to 44%.
The average temperature (a period between one and 14 days) is a distance from one to another; it usually becomes five days. For example, measuring half of COVID-19 people who lose their sense of smell at first was 30% and later fell to 15%.
Other details of the spread of disease are still considered.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact with small droplets that form during coughing, coughing, or speaking; when contacting close to one another about six to four feet (1 to 6 m).
Research has found that the undamaged cough can lead to the falls to a distance of up to 40 feet [4.5 m] (15 m) to 8 feet [8.2 m] (27 m).
Some have raised the possibility that the virus may be transmitted by small droplets that stay longer in the air, which can be present during speech, and breathing babies can also be formed during breathing, including when speaking, although the virus often does not move through the air.
Flax can remain in the beaks or in the noses of nearby people or can be picked up into the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as integration and Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause breathing loss to become hydraulic and result in air pollution.
It may also spread when someone touches an infected area, which includes the skin, and then affects the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Or there is concern that it may multiply in the wild, the danger believes that it is inferior.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection by touching the mouth after contact with sewage. The virus has a greater risk of collusion within the first three days of symptoms, even though the spread may occur before symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Tests revealed that people were infected three days before the signal was given to indicate that transmission is possible before the development of important symptoms.
Only a few reports do not have the signals confirmed by the moth, but unmarked transmission has been reported to other countries during a follow - up investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports that while it does not fully explain how disease spreads easily, one person often infects two or three others. The virus lives on for hours and days beyond things.
Directly, the virus is detected until three days in plastic (pollypropylene) and 304 on stainls, one day on the board, and four hours in the colon.
This, however, differs from the temperature and temperature. Home animals and other animals have been found to have COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, even though British gadgets ordered that a person wash his hands after touching animals, as is the case after contact with infected people who may be infected.
Savere acre respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CIV-2) is the new virus, which was first isolated from three cases of pneumonia in the Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CIV-2 virus occur in a way that is related to the environment of coronaviruses. Apart from the human body, the virus dies with a domestic nail, as it melts its external defense. SARS-CIV-2 is related to the SARS-CV first SARS-CV.
It was caused by the introduction of the relationship between the animal and the wild beast.
Genetic research has shown that coronavirus is a genetic link with the Betacoronavirus species, the lowers of the Sarbecovirus (lineage B), and a few of the bats.
It is the equivalent of 96% of the total number of samples of other bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is a single amino acid in different parts of the chemical order between bacteria from pangolins and humans.
All the genetic comparisons up to this day found that it could be 92% of the material between the pangolin and SARS-CV-2, which would not be enough to prove that the pangolins are the middle guardians.
A viral infection may be obtained by detecting symptoms, even though confirmation is finally resulting by converting the transdictorase channel reaction (rRT-PCR) of the target or by a CT image.
A study that compares PCR to the CT in Wuhan raised that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although its accuracy is lower, since most of its group's images are in some of the methods of pneumonia and disease.
"Since March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT should not be used for research or for the first method of checking COVID-19".
WHO has published a list of RNA laws for SARS-CIV-2, first published in January 17.
Test uses the conditional-time regexpation protocol channel channel reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be made by breathing samples or by blood products.
The results are often obtained within a few hours of the day.
The test is usually performed by a nasophaaryngal swab although the tube is also used. The number of tubes and companies improve the performance of natural, which is capable of finding an antibodides.
Since 6 April 2020, not one of these has advanced as well as was accurate if it was ordered to be used everywhere.
In US a test of a natural process developed by the Cellex is authorized to be used with emergency situations only with certificates.
Image attributes in radar and uploaded tomography (CT) for people who show symptoms include asymmetrically perimeter signal signal blows and an increase of visualisation.
The Italian Radiological Society combines the international database to be found with valid models.
Because of the risk of some diseases such as adenovism, taking pictures without checking the PCR has a limit to identifying COVID-19.
The major research in China compared the effects of CT and PCR and showed that although the image has a small degree of flexibility, it is very sensitive and sensitive, which is thought to be considered a test instrument in the epidecic areas of an epidemic.
Organizational and national services based on spiritual information development have been improved so that they can investigate the properties of the virus by means of both radar and CT.
Prevention techniques include maintaining personal hygiene, handwashing, avoiding eye contact, nose, or mouth by the hands that are not washed, and coughing and using the toilet and putting the toilet directly into the trash.
Those who may have had a measure of popularity were encouraged to wear a mask in the community.
The steps of physical isolation are also encouraged to protect communication. Many governments have set limits or warn of unnecessary travel from lands affected by the epidemic.
Yet, the virus has reached the point where it can spread to all parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still in the middle of communities, and some members of the community do not know where it is. Health personnel who care for someone who may be involved are encouraged to use a specified method of caution, contact care, and protection of the eyes. Following a vital approach to health authorities see the source of communication and prevent further communication.
Using a local tap from the government for this purpose has eliminated concern over privacy rights, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations produce a statement that restricts this view.
There have already been different apps installed or raised for voluntary use, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional groups have worked with mutual understanding and secrecy, such as using Bluetooth to insert a log of user's attachments into other people's scam.
Users can now receive a message when it happens to get close to someone tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. There are falling misconceptions of methods of prevention; for example, cleaning the nose and moutthush fishing is useless.
There is no cure for COVID-19, though many organizations are involved in building it.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially when you leave the toilet or slums visible; before eating; and after a cold, cough, or sneeze.
The reason for this is that apart from the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, since it emits its own vaccine.
The CDC also encouraged the use of analcohol - based handanitzer to have at least 60% of the alcohol in volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Areas can be treated with a few resolutions (in a single minute of exposure to us instead of stainles steels), including 62.7% of ethanol, 50–100% of the isopropanol, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% of hydrogen perxide, and 0.2.7% of Povidone-idine-idine.
Some solutions, such as the laalconium chloride and chrohexidine glunet, work at a low rate.
The CDC recommends that if the example of COVID is criticized or confirmed in such places as office or day care, all such areas as office, private rooms, public facilities, and public transportation systems, such as cables, portable screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM devices, must be killed by germs.
Health organizations encourage people to brush their mouth or nose with a doll or with an acne when they cough, or sneeze, and then throw out any rash at once.
The surgical masks are lifted up to those who may be associated with them, as wearing a mask puts a limit on the amount of breath and the degree of breathing drops out when speaking, coughing, and coughing.
WHO has provided guidelines as to when and how to use masks.
" According to Stephen Griffin, avirogist at the University of Leeds, "Hading a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of exposure without proper handwashing. "Amaski is also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill."
WHO recommends that non - ill people wear masks only when they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to promote the public’s use of masks.
In the U.S.A., the CDC encourages wearing a cloth mask rather than a health care. China has directly recommended that non-integration members use the abandoned medical masks, especially when you get closer to one another (1 m) or below) with other people.
Hong Kong encourages wearing surgical masks when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded places.
Health workers in Thailand are urging people to make sandwiches in their homes and to clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed the door to the community without wearing a mask or wearing a nose and a mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going to public places for protection for himself and for others.
The government of Austria ruled that everyone entering a food store should wear a mask.
Israel has invited all citizens to wear a dominant mask when in public.
Taiwan, as it continues to produce ten million masks a day since mid - March, asks the train and city buses to wear face - to - face masks on 1 April 1.
Panama has made it a challenge to wear face masks whenever you go outside, while at the same time it encourages building a face mask at home for those who can’t afford face masks.
Eye masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control the interaction intended to relieve the spread of disease by reducing human contact.
Roads include division; travel barriers; closed schools, places of work, stadiums, bars, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use the means of separation by staying at home, having pregnancy, avoiding crowded places, greeting one another without contact, and physically isolation from others.
Many governments are now pressuring or promoting socialist control in those areas affected by the epidemic.
The highest number of meetings raised by the US government and health organizations was suddenly reduced to 250 persons (if there was not a shortage of COVID-19 in place) was placed on 50 perpele, and later on 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed the public meeting of more than two people. Older adults and those with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, respiratory infections, and immune agents were faced with the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay at home as far as possible in areas of the endangered society. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health branches began to use the term ‘ physical isolation ’ instead of the ‘ social isolation, to make clear that it is intended to reduce physical contact at the same time being kept in contact by the same way as it is kept in contact.
"Use of the "Neutral" club" and lead to the conclusion that people must participate completely in social isolation may encourage them to continue to interact with others in different ways. Some authorities have given out guidelines for sexual health that are not used when the plague continues.."
These include encouragement to have sexual intercourse only with a roommate, who is free of HIV or the virus.
The isolation of home is what has been encouraged for those who have a COVID-19 and for those who feel that they are likely to be involved.
Many governments have put pressure on citizens to keep their homes in good repair.
The most difficult instructions to keep close to home are passed by those in high - risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or a territory that can be widely distributed are encouraged to be confined for 14 days since it may be the last time.
Tacts to control the epidemic are to prevent or control, to prevent, and to reduce, damage.
Coverage is followed in the first stages of the epidemic and is intended to search out and separate the infected and to introduce other programs to control the spread of infection and to prevent the spread of disease.
If it is not possible to prevent the spread of disease, efforts are going from lowering the limit: measures are taken to facilitate the spread and to reduce its effects on health care and society.
Two steps to close and slow down may be followed at the same time.
Stress requires more extreme measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the average birthrate to less than 1. Part of the care for the outbreak of an infectious disease to try to reduce the height of the quake, known as the stroke line.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be overwhelmed and allows more time for medicine and herbs to be built.
Uncommunicative interventions include self-contamination measures, such as handwashing, wearing masks, masking, social action towards physical disparity such as blocking schools and exposing public social events; sharing in encouraging the public to accept and participate in such involvements as such; and so non-natural measures as cleaning. The more extreme measures to block the eruptions were taken in China where the extent of the eruption is clear, and to make clear, and to enforce laws that protect visits.
Other countries have also received different measures designed to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced the public view and made space imprisonments, and gave warnings of the movements of those involved.
Singapore has had financial support for those who are involved to close up and has forced a high price on those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan has raised the face - to - face product and has laid down the sentence of the medical assault. Imitating the situation of Great Britain and the United States shows that reducing (saturated but not halting the increase of the plague) has major challenges.
The main reduction rules may reduce the serious need for health care by 2/3 and death in part, yet the result is the death of hundreds of thousands and the frustration of health programs.
Stress may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until a cure is found, if that comes first), as contact jumps as soon as the steps are released.
Long - term intervention to suppress the plague creates social and economic costs.
No drugs are specifically authorized to fight COVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing existing drugs.
Taking drugs from stores, taking liquids, and resting may help reduce symptoms.
It depends on difficulty, breathing air, fluid injected fluid, and support for breathing may be necessary.
The use of steroids may undermine the results.
Many of the elements that have been authorized to work on a growing number of other diseases are being investigated to be used in treating CEVID-19.
"WO also published that some "old and home's" herbs can be effective for the symptoms of SARS-CIV-19 creatures.
To raise the strength and adapt to health care according to the need of COVID-19 patients is raised by WHO as a critical step in response to puberty.
The ECDC and the European regulatory of WHO have released hospital procedures and health - care providers who have been able to move services in different stages, including focusing on the use of laboratory operations on COVID-19, highlighting the preferred procedures where possible, separating and separating the patients of COVID-19, and increasing the critical care capacity by reducing personnel and increasing the number of respiratory - beds.
There are various opinions as to where the first example (called egg cell) came from.
The first known example of a new coronavirus returns to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In about a month, the number of examples of corronavirus in Hubei increased slightly.
These had been closely connected with the Huan Seafoot Wholesele Market, which also sold living animals, and the theory that the virus came from one of these species; or, in other words, it had a source of transfer from an unknown animal. The bottle of magagre was recognized in 26 December and treated by the physician Zang Jixian at Hube Special Hospital, who reported to the Wuhan Jianghan Jiang CDC in December 27.
"In December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their partners of "coronavirus like SARS".
Two doctors, including Li Wenling, are ordered by the police by spreading erroneous gossip, and the other, Ai Fen, was warned by his officers against sounding a warning.

A study of prepropourary corroavirus since 2019 Covid-19 and SARS-CV-2 virus involves the means to identify the presence of the virus and those which see the antics that are formed as a result of an individual's intervention.
The presence of vibrations is verified by the RT-PCR who checks the presence of the RNA for clonevirus.
This survey is specially designed to monitor the RNA of SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to ensure a new or existing diagnosis.
Anthropomorphisms, serology, can be used for both a person's disease test or the working of a company.
An antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small if they had no symptoms at all.
The exact number of deaths due to this disease and the degree of public inadequacy can be determined by the results of the test.
In view of the estimates, by March 2020, there are no countries that have statistics to be relied upon as to the number of viruses in their society.
By March 23, no country has investigated more than 3 people in its own countries and there are major variations in the number of surveys that have been done in various countries.
This difference may affect the number of deaths reported on in some countries.
With the use of re-time reprocessoration power channel for action, rt-PCR, this test can be made by various sources of information, including the Nasoparyal database or the "Super-PCR" software.
The results are usually achieved within two hours to 2 days.
A test called RT-PCR by throat swabs can be trusted only in the first church.
In the future, the virus can disappear from the throat but continues to increase in the lungs.
In infected people tested for the second week, some oral receptors can be removed from the bottom of the vaginal smoke channels or through the coughing of the maritial, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR methods of testing were developed at Charite in Berlin in January 2020 with the re-time reprocessation power channel channel for action, giving the basis for the distribution of 250,000 boats by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed the method of testing on 23 January 2020. South Korea’s Kogenebiotech Company developed the PCR-based SARSCIV-2 kit on the medical level on 28 January 2020.
"Congrete" "Egene" is similar to all beta coronaviruses and RdRp gene only available in SARS-CoV-2. China, BGI Group was one of the companies who received the permit of the National Products Administration of China to use the PCR-base SARS-CV-2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDCC, is spreading the 2019-Novell Corveviruss, 2019-20-Nol RPLCCCCCCCs at the National Center of Health for Research.
Three of the genes tests on the old checkpoints caused a vague result because of the misdiagnoses and the difficulty of a CDC test in Atlanta, resulting in a average of less than 100 satellites a day successful for all February 2020.
Research using two undiscovered sections can be relied on until 28, February 2020 and up to that time when regional and local research agencies are allowed to begin a test.
This method was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Administration. The private laboratory began a survey at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 the LabCorp announced the worldwide availability of a CEVID-19 test based on RT-PCR
The Queen Diagnostics similarly conducted a COVID-19 survey from 9 March 2020.
No mathematical limits were announced, collection and recording of specimen should be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 investigations were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Viology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this test was registered by the Federal Service for Survival in Health. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a type of COVID-19 tests. On 13 March 2020, the Roche Diagnostics obtained a FDA test form made within 3.5 hours, thus allowing one device to perform a 24-hour examination.
In 19 March 2020, the FDA has issued the Abbot Laboratories authorisation of critical times, EUA, to investigate with Abbott m2,000, FDA had previously given Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific to obtain the same authorization.
On 21 March 2020, Cephed has likewise received EUA for FDA type of test that takes less than 45 minutes.
FDA has allowed the test type to use for PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this type may provide the effects of postage in a few minutes with a ignitive in 13 minutes.
There are currently some 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott is waiting to increase its performance to do up to 50,000 tests a day. The tests using the nonobony that adheres specially to the nuclecopsoid program, N Protein, and novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan in the hope that it may not provide results in 15 to 20 seconds similar as influenza.
"Recording of the text of March 2020 concluded that "secret" radar records are of little value in the early stages and that CT, computer tomography, may be present before symptoms of disease begin to appear."
Common features of the CT include bipolar group grouping-groups (percientificial, ansimetial service).
Sub-procession, chrazy diavidation and consuldation increases as disease changes.
A search that compares PCR to CT at Wuhan at the site of the epidemic and suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR but has no details, most of which are related to other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"According to March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT can be used for sorting or testing COVID-19 for the first time" according to March 2020, the CDC encourages the PCR in the first case"
The fourth part of the immune system is the production of antibodies, including Igm and IgG.
These can be used to test the presence of disease from the past seven days or more, so that the symptoms of disease could appear to be in the presence of an infectious disease, in order to indicate the integration and employment of the community. Asseys can be made into principal checks , CLTs, or point-of-care test, Postt.
The high rate of automated systems in many medical research centers will be able to work with essies, but their availability will depend on each of them.
With CLT, only the perimeter of perimeter blood is commonly used, even though sepecimens are not used for immune response.
With PoCT, single specimen is commonly obtained by placing the skin on the skin.
In contrast with PCR methods, shot action is not needed before the approach. On 26 March 2020, FDA introduced 29 letters that reported the Agency as necessary and are now able to distribute their antibody test.
According to April 7, 2020, only one method of testing approved by FDA under the authority of emergency conditions. Toward the end of March 2020, the Euroimium Medical Laboratory and Eroimme Diagnostics obtained permission for its European bytes to test to see IgG antibodies and IG and IGA against the viruss on the web bells.
The test volume is a few hundred yards per hour so it is faster than the transnational PCR assy of Viral RNA.
In April, UK found that none of the antibodies she had bought would be able to use effectively.
"Ehong Kong of programs where suspects of patients can stay at home, "" the emergency exits which will give the patient a capimen tube", to pour them back and receive the results after a while. The British HS has announced that it initiates a test program that eliminates the patient’s threat if he goes to the hospital or the need to clean the patient’s public transport if there is an operation. In regard to the patient's personal transport service. In regard to the diagnosis patients in the COVID-19, the health worker will not go down on the vehicle that will use the appropriate treatment.
In Germany, the National Association of Status Health Physicians spoke of 2 March, saying that it contained some 12,000 meals a day for a fast - making program and a survey of 10,700 in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance when a test is called by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to include 160,000 studies a week.
Beginning in March 19 the driving test was given in many large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of surveys done by Germany was unknown, since only true results are reported.
"The first analysis of the site showed that from the 12/2020 calendar calendar week a total of at least 483,225 samples were analyzed and included 12/2020 plus 33,491 samples (6.9%) when checked checked for SARS-CV-2. Israeli, researchers in its Technion and Rambam Hospitals, and analyzed how to examine the data of 64 patients at once, with only more evidence and more when the data was included to confirm. Wunndox 1000-pope of the screen of the issue called "Hone" or "Hone" for "Hone" or "Hinz" for "Hone"
Since the building was still under the hands of the American founder Wang Jian and took five days, modeling shows that the Hubei models would have been up by 47% and the proper cost of meeting imprisonment would be doubled if the capacity to include research was not available at a time.
The Wuhan Leb is immediately followed by the Hu-Yan libraries in Shenzen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 towns throughout China.
From 4 March 2020 the total daily transmission of a day into some 50,000 daily surveys. The open source, complex drawings released by Origami Asssays have been opened so that it can examine the majority of patients ’ samples up to 1122 on COVID19 using only 93 asseys. These technical drawings can work in small libraries without the need of alcohol - sensitive robots.
Since March, a shortage of an average number of regegents has become an item in surveying the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This led some writers to check the rules for samples that involve burning samples at 98 ° C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to allow more tested RNA elements. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now examining its more people’s own population considering Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was walking with good foot to increase the quality of the test to reach a large portion of the population.
"This was a combination of merger-depence-sphere to group power, and bought a protocol-thropouterator in Group 42 and BGI (based on "Hoo-Yan" megeny system in China).
It is built in 14 days, the library is capable of directing tens of thousands of tests per day by the RT-PCR and the first in the world of this active level outside China.
Various methods of understanding research in various corronavirus components are developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German method of building coconuts sent to poor countries without their own resources.
The German procedure was published in January 2020; a policy established by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not established until 28 January, delayed the available research in the U.S.A. China and the United States faced the problems of autopsy tests at the beginning of the eruption, and these countries and Australia were not able to build and produce enough boats to satisfy the need and encourage health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the wide availability of experiments in South Korea has helped us to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The powers of monitoring, especially in private libraries, are built over a period of many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the ability of test procedures as the best way to relieve the infection of the COVID-19 virus. The high need for screening due to the spread of the virus caused an integration of hundreds of thousands of workers in U.S. libraries, and the production of satellites and chemicals are stressful.
In March 2020 China reported problems on the accuracy of its checkettes.
"In the United States, the CDC checkpoints found "with error"; the government removed the law walls which were forbidden to check secretly. Spain bought the keys from the Chinese firm Shen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it found that the results were not true."
The company explained that the wrong results may be due to judging the collection of samples or the proper use of the keys.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would release the boats to produce the wrong results, and they would put in their pocket the different operations for Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the Czech Republic checkrs that bought them in China produced some erroneous results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million checkpoints in China that were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovič raised that they should be cast off by being added to Danube. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said that Turkwewichry checks found to have "a high degree of error" and didn't" have been used. "UK bought 3.5 million checkpoints in China but at the beginning of April 2020"
The study, followed by the arrests of those who were found to confirm their testing and were followed by the individuals who had had had contact with the individuals who indicated that SARS-CIV-2 test, and the results were to be verified.
Researchers working in the Italian city of VO, the first COVID-19 death area in Italy, directed the two rounds of a total survey of 3,400 people, at least ten days away.
At least half the individuals who went through the tests did not have symptoms, and all the examples they found were locked away.
Since the visits are short - lived, this puts off completely new attachments.
In the wake of enthusiastic arrests, incoming visits have been started, investigations, and shutters, the 2020 Coronavirus epidemic in Singapore continues much faster than other developed countries, but without such difficult restrictions as forcing fast - food and other commercial stores to close.
Many events have been turned on, and Singapore began to advise citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but schools opened early on vacation on March 23.
A number of countries have also been able to deal with the epidemic with the stride of tracking, internal pregnancy, investigations, and shutters, but to a small degree at low level, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that the more research countries, compared with the number of deaths, have a lower mortality rate, which may be due to their being in the best position to investigate those who have symptoms or have none at all.
WHO recommends that nations who have no access to national testing and have national databases with limited experience on COVID-19 sent the first five and ten reliable samples of COVID-19 for each of the 16 registered U.S. libraries will ensure a search.
Of the 16 reliable libraries, 7 of Asia, 5 of Europe, 2 of Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next chapter, the album "Declaration % of Tests" is influenced by a national survey plan.
A country that examines only hospital recipients will have many a guarantee of % of a national survey of all its citizens, whether they show the symptoms or not, other things are equal.
Handwashing (or washing hands) is also known as handwashing, the practice of washing hands with the intention of removing soil, glue, small objects, or unwanted Portuguese.
Cleaning hands with soap regularly in those "disaster times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are associated with the oral waste process.
People may also be exposed to respiratory infections such as colds or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the traits that we have just developed).
The five crucial times during the day when washing the hands with soap are essential include: before and after the discharge, after washing the breast or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing the food or handling the raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization promotes washing of hands:
First, inside, and after preparing the food.
Before and after treating a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing the child used the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Hygiene refers to hygienic practices that are closely related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or treatment can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of the surgical washing of hands is to wash the hands of the hands (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms can cause diseases) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important to people who are handling food or working in the medical field, but it is an important procedure even for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of cold, corronavirus, and other infectious diseases; to protect against the common causes of diarrhea; to reduce respiratory infections;
and reduce infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing may lead to a small improvement during the child's development under five years of age.
In developing countries, the death rate of young people associated with respiratory and diarrhoeic diseases can be reduced by starting a simple change of behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
A simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by about 50%.
Handwashing techniques can reduce diarrhea chapters by three parts, and this can be compared to performing clean water in economically poor areas.
A drop in diapers in 48% can be linked to washing hands with soap. Washing with soap is one way that works well and cheap to protect diarrhea and acupation (ARI), as a process of functioning in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The main ARI, which leads alone as a cause of infant deaths under five years of age, costs an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to the death of about 3.5 million babies a year.
According to UNICEF, changing the washing of hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet as a strict routine can save more health than any single therapy or medical intervention, deciding death for the cause of diarrhea about half death for respiratory infections in one part.
Hand washing is often combined with other sewage interventions as part of the water, sewage and sanitation programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against spina bifida through direct contact.
A small accident results as a result of regularly washing hands is skin damage caused by skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can have a side effect on the bite, and the skin condition known as quadrititis, which is the most common in health - care workers.
Washing hands frequently is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsive-compulive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease through oral hygiene: after using the toilet (baby, defecating), after washing the baby’s genitals (the change of diapers), before feeding the baby, before or before or before preparing the meal or handling of raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
Other times when proper handwashing should be followed in order to avoid transmission of the disease includes before and after the maintenance of an injury or injury; after coughing, coughing, or whetting; after touching an animal’s nostrils or touching animals; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on the average, 38.7% of families are following the practice of washing their hands with soap. 2014 surveys showed that Saudi Arabia had a high rate of 97 percent; the United States close to between 77 percent; and China at the lowest level of 23 percent. It is now available in raising the practice to accept the practice of handwasing at difficult times. The washing of hands as a school group of children in one of the developing countries to improve the hands of children's bodies.
The "Essental Health Care Program" that was initiated by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the number of health and education efforts of children.
Two rings a year, accompanied by a regular washing of hands with soap, a daily fluoride, are a pillar of the world order.
It was also successfully started in Indonesia.
Removing microorganism from the skin is better by being applied to soap or cleaning water.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce substances preventing the solution, and increase the peaceability.
Water alone is not enough to wash the skin because oil and protein, called soil buildings, are not easily dehydrated.
But sanitation helps to increase the flow of water.
The powder, which is capable of reuse, may harbor the bacteria remaining in previous operations.
A small number of research studies dealing with the transmission of a virus from an infected ovary conclude that it is impossible as germs are cleaned and foam.
The CDC continues that "a liquid soap and control without hands is better."
Antiviral soaps are widely advertised by health - care community members.
To this day, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or improved digents prefers natural antibiotic-resistisms.
However, antibacterial soaps have common antibacterial agents such as trilosan, which have a long list of sistant straons organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial antigens are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may be unable to function properly as they are sold.
Besides the surfactant, complex buildings may have acids (acetic acids, arcric acids, lacic acid) as the control of the pH, anti microbulbilly antibulic acids and other skin care providers (aloe vares, viras, vitamins, platforms, platforms). An extensive analysis of data from the Universe of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that useless needles function in the same way as doric acid is used to prevent infections and bacteria.
Hot water that you can’t clean your hands doesn’t burn enough to kill germs.
Germs increase considerably when the fever of the tsetse fly is (37 ° C).
Yet, warm, soapy water works better than cold water, which has soap to remove natural fuels that capture soil and bacteria.
Unlike belief in a multitude, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water does not contribute to the reduction of microbial lead in hands.
The hand antizer or an anti-antiseptic is a symbol of water - free hands cleaners.
At the end of the 1990s and early part of the 21st century, non-monetic agents of alcohol vomiting (also known as alcohol-bad din ubbs, antiseptic waves, or danizers) began to receive the applause.
Many based on the isopropyl alcool or ethanol extracted was grouped with a burning agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to form a humict like glycerin liquid, or foam so it could be easy to use and reduce the temperature of alcohol.
Plastic - peroxide inserts an anticubial activity further. Handholds containing 60 to 95% kill bacteria successfully.
Alcohol rububs kill germs, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other bacteria (including HIV, herpes, RSV, thinovirus, vascinsia, influenza, and hetaitis).
Alcohol rumb saniters with 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% less, as well as 35 decibels less than 30 seconds after rubbing and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log) bacteria in 1 minute hands after they are rubbed. Handholders are effective and are less effective in certain bacteria.
Alcotil is virtually useless for norvirus (or Norrwilk) bacteria, a common cause of gestrenteritis. A sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to administer it completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the back end of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the fluid, nose, or pipe is dry.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing instead of washing with hantizers, a large area where the hands are clearly bent.
The rise in the use of these representatives is due to their simple action and quickness to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to replace proper handwashing unless soap and water are not available.
Using alcohol pants regularly can cause dry skin unless the enzymes are inserted together and/or skin perfumes in a combination.
Analcohol process can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or emollents in combination.
In a medical study, netizers based on alcohol with emolliens produce better skin discomforts and dryness than soap or anticlips.
Allergicint properties, Canturia syndrome or hyperventilation to alcohol or annotives present in the alcohol bell rums are rare.
The humble state of creating the irritant concrete dermatatis becomes attractive when compared with the washing of hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water - free agents cannot wash their hands from natural elements, but they kill germs.
For this reason, the hanits are not as efficient as soap and water to protect the spread of more Pathogens, since the Pathogens continue to be in hand.
The success of non-alcohol non-combs depends more on the materials and combinations, and history is more complex than alcohol and alcohol bubs.
Recently, a combination of the allcoinium chloride has shown the persistence and expansion of an anticlipbial activity after anointing, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the performance after repeated activity, may be the reason for the continued reaction of the skin.
Many people in economically poor societies are unable to buy soap and use ash or ground instead.
ash or soil may work better than water, but it is less efficient than soap.
One of the main concerns is that if soil or ash gets contaminated by micro-organisms, the spread of disease may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also an agent that eliminates the virus because when it is mixed with water, an alkaline mix is created.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap when soap is not available.
A proper procedure for washing hands that is encouraged by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Training of Diseases includes:
Fill your hands with warm or cold water.
Flowing water is encouraged because standing bees may be contaminated, whereas cold or hot water conditions do not reflect the difference.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with adequate soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap raises bacteria in the skin, and studies show that people tend to clean their hands better if there is soap than when they use only water.
Move down at least 20 seconds.
Sneaking causes heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and long - term exposure removes more viruses.
Rinse well under running water.
Cleaning your hands can be damaging
You dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Dried hands and skeletals are easy to take in the pollution. The easily forgotten places are the thumb, the wrist, the middle of the fingers, and the underside of the nails.
The bumps of the fitting with a low polish may carry microorganism.
A steaming machine is often encouraged to keep hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise the risk of infection.
Various inexpensive programs can be made to deal with the washing of hands when tap water and/or soap is not available. To pour water by running a well or a well with suitable openings and/or use ash if required in developing countries. In conditions such as schools or rural areas in developing countries, there are methods of saving water, such as "tily-taps" and other methods of saving money.
Lipy-tap is a simple technique for using a rope drum, and a foot-worker that draws little water into the hands and the tip of the pot.
Practical hand washing is an important part of the washing process, but there are disagreements as to how it works best to dry in public toilets.
A growing rate of research suggests that paper taps are better hygienic than electrical heating found in the bathrooms.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and supported by the European Tissue Sympusium paper firm, compared the standards of hygiene found in paper floors, steams, and the latest steams of hot air.
After washing and drying hands in hot air temperatures, the total number of bacteria was found to rise by the size of the fingers by 1994% and at the left of the hand by 254%.
Drowing in hot air temperatures was effective in raising the total number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and 15% hand to a quarter.
After washing and washing hands with a sheet of paper, the total number of bacteria fell to the fingers by 76% and on the fingers by arriving at 77%. Scientists again took a test that would indicate if there was a chance to join the users of the cleaning facilities as a result of each dry process.
A quick steam of air, which releases the air from it at a fixed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), succeeded in pumping micro-organisms on the hand and almost joining other users and cleaning space of about seven feet [2 m].
The use of hot air may not cause micro-reganism to be up to 50 feet [0.25 m] from the steam.
The paper drawers did not show a significant rise in the presence of micro-Organisms. In 2005, a study directed by TāV Produtt und Wwalt was conducted.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after laying hands were noted:
There are many met metamorphosis manufacturers, and hand mills have been compared to drypaper toels.
Washing your hands using dry hanits is another way when traveling by soap and water.
A hantizer built with alcohol must have at least 60%.
Medical care was forced long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis got its work (in 1846) in the hospital area.
There are electric - powered ticks that operate by keeping the hospital staff reminding them to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found a reduction in the rate of disease rates in the workplace.
Medical washing is about 15 seconds, using a large quantity of soap and water or a gel to relax or clean each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together by twirling the fingers together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since bacteria can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to thoroughly clean and dry with a clean bed.
After drying, a sheet of paper must be used to close the water (and open any exit door if possible).
This, of course, avoid any repetition of the unclean hands in such places.
The aim is to clean the hands to care for the care system to remove the pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that giving up handwashing continues to be out of favor in many medical areas, a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget washing their hands before contacting patients, thus passing microorganisms.
One study showed that handwashesing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catalyd bloodred blood pressure in 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a chart showing the system of handwashing and handwashing in the field of health care.
The organization’s improved sanitary regulations can be obtained from its album to make public opinion.
The return should be directed by the Whiteby etl.
Storers may be able to measure and ensure handwashing, if it is necessary to prove and comply with the law.
The World Health Organization "has five times" to wash hands:
after blood transfusions
before an apocalyptic operation, right
and after care for the patient. putting antidepressant chemicals into the bottle ("in the bottle" or the "rejection of microbes") gives the power to kill in such handwashing.
That power may be required before surgery or in cases where antibacterial ororgenisms are plentiful. 'Cartisting hands to someone for the purpose of the operation, it is necessary to have a pump open and closed without being touched by hand, chlorophexidine or iodine wish, towels to stop hands after cleaning, and a screw towish to wash your hands, and other refrigering device to clean under the nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This process requires the washing of hands and arms to the foreway, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long drill periods (10 minutes) are not needed.
When kicking, the water in the arm must be prevented from running back into the hands.
After completing the washing of hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth or a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash your hands or use a steroids before and after care for the patient.
In order to control staphyloccal diseases in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from clean hands comes from the first 20% of the cleaning, and that very little more is available when repeated washing is increased than 35%.
Washing with empty soap has a three - fold rate of foodborne disease compared to cleaning with an antibacterial soap. Compare hand-rubing with analhol-based condition to a timbiterial acid for a medtime of 30 seconds right right right to the alcohol right right right right in eating. This compares the automation 26% of the an antibacterial service.
But soap and water works better than alcohol-bad dand bubs in reducing H1N1 influenza Avirus and Clostidium dialysis in the hands. Taking in to improve physical hygiene in health care conditions may include teaching personnel by handwashing, promoting the availability of alcohol-bad bandb, and the written and spoken reminders to workers.
There is a need for further research to determine which methods of introduction works best in different health - care situations.
In developing countries, soap - washing is viewed as a desirable means, an important tool for achieving good health, even physical health.
Yet, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces presents a challenge to achieving the world’s habit of washing hands.
In many African villages, for example, there is a lack of access to handwashing and private toilets, although there are no shortcuts for building handwashing.
Yet, low standards for handwashing may be the cause of more entrenched habits than the lack of soap or water.
Advertising and standing for soap can contribute to legal action, promoting awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and leading to a change in social behavior.
For this to work properly, caution and discretion are essential.
A report of some 70 surveys found that the methods that depend on society are effective in raising hands on the LMICs, while social advertising campaigns work slowly. One example of a campaign to promote handwashing in schools of UNICEF's "Thirtyth System" encourages schools to take simple, practical measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, during other requirements of hygiene.
When small amounts are reached, schools can come from one another and eventually up to three stars.
Handwashing can be part of the advertising campaign that is being done to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is one of the examples of activities that promote caution in an attempt to achieve a change of habits. As a result of the 2010-20 Coronavirus epidemic, UNICEF declared the widespread use of handwashage.
A few studies have considered the total cost of hand washing in developing countries and relationships with DALYs.
However, one return suggests that soapwashing can save far more costs than water entry and cleaning.
The importance of personal hygiene – especially for people under the weaknesses of the new mother - in - law or injured soldiers in hospitals – was first observed in the middle of the 19th century by two ways of physical hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, England "initiates modern nursing."
At the time, many people still believed that disease was caused by bad odors called maasmas.
In the 1980 ’ s, outbreaks from food and medical - related diseases led to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advertise more handwashing as an important means of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of Tsine flu in 2009 and the COVID - 19 epidemic in 2020 led to high awareness in many countries regarding the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from this type of infectious disease.
For example, the phototas carry the "right handwashing procedure" is held up near the public toilets and private rooms in the buildings of the offices and airports in Germany.
The phrase ‘ to wash your hands, ’ for one thing, means to make clear that someone does not want to take responsibility for something or get involved with it.
Its origin is part of the Bible in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision to beat Jesus Christ, but we have become a more effective term in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth is first forced by washing his hands in an attempt to clear himself of the alleged uncleanness, which represents a guilty conscience regarding the crimes he had committed and persuaded her husband to do them.
It has also been found that after remembering or imagining wrong acts, people tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they usually appreciate the importance of washing more hands.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands after that, they are less likely to share in acts of “cleaning, ” such as scholarship.
Religion promotes the washing of hands for both the purpose of cleanliness and the image. It is a symbol of the washing of hands, using water but without soap, which is part of the washing of hands in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and natlamy in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam. The religions also promote handwasing, especially after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam demand the washing of hands after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam demand the washing of hands before and after meals.
COVID-19 Risk Management Controls
The risk control system for the office of COVID-19 is the use of theoravirus (COVID-19) safety procedures for opportunic safety and emergency control.
Proper safety controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and type of work, by supporting a study of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors on the crew individually may be weakened in preventing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Organizational Safety and Health Administration (OWA), low - risk activities have a level of social contact with other employees, which means that simple preventive measures are recommended, include washing the hands, urging workers to stay home when they are sick, good breathing habits, and maintaining the system of cleaning and poisoning in the workplace.
Both activities that are exposed to internal hazards include those that require regular and close contact with strangers or those who are suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected by constant social transmissions or travel abroad.
These include employees who have social contact with the public as public schools, crowded business districts, and crowded business conditions.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple preventive measures, include high-offiication that uses high-ficiency factor factors, sneeze guards, and the ability to have a visual effect on the environment in which a person with COVID-19 is found.
The OXA considers health workers who are exposed to well - known people or who are suspected of having COVID-19 as the highest risk of exposure, which rises to the highest risk of exposure when workers make an aerosol-genering program, or pick up or carry spems from well - known people or target to COVID-19.
The appropriate safety controls in these operations include construction controls such as build control control control factors, and adequate persertive action on the job.
the rise of the*COD-19 can have serious effects inside the working area.
Workers may be absent from work because of sickness, the need to care for others, or because of fear of being exposed.
Selling habits may change, in both types of goods needed, with means of obtaining these goods (such as buying at leisure time or by being picked or by driving jobs).
Finally, the transfer of materials from the hard - affected regions of COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparing for an infectious disease with a system of response can be used to direct protective activities.
Programs take into account the risk factors involved in various workplaces and types of work environments, including the types of exposures, the hazards that arise in home or in public conditions, and the hazards of workers as high as age, or the conditions of chronic diseases.
They also explain the proper control to meet those risks, and the following programs for situations that may arise as a result of an eruption.
The preparation of infectious disease and responsive programs may depend on the promotion of national or regional law.
The aim of responding to an emergency includes reducing the number of colleagues, protecting people at higher risk of serious health problems, maintaining business practices, and reducing the serious consequences of other businesses and consumers.
The severity of the disease in the community affects the action taken.
Staffs to control hazards, which are widely used in the "Occupial" and "heal" administrations with the results.
When COVID-19 accidents are not removed, building control works best, is followed by control, and eventually personal protection.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related dangers without relying on the worker’s routine, and it can be a step toward greater expense when applied.
Ants to administer changes to a job policy or procedures requiring the action of a employee or an employer
Personal protility (PEE) considers it to be less effective than administrative and administrative control, but it can help prevent exposure.
All forms of PPE must be selected on the basis of a job accident, properly dressed as necessary (e.e., predefects), and in a manner always worn, checked, maintained, and modified, according to the need, and appropriately removed, cleaned, and stored or discarded.
According to the U.S. Global Safety and Health Administration (OWA), low - open jobs have little social contact with the community and other social institutions.
The simple precautions recommended in all areas of the workplace include regularly handwashing and careful cleaning, urging employees to stay at home when they are sick, breathing habits involving covering coughs and noses, massage and tubing, preparing household chores or stoves that are needed, encouraging the staff to avoid the use of tools and equipment, and keeping them up - to - date cleaning and contact with germs in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of people who may be infected are a vital step in protecting workers, clients, watches, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with oral respiratory symptoms should stay at home until they have no more heat, and other symptoms other than 24 hours without the use of anti-spacing or changing symptoms, and that day - care rules are extreme, allow the staff to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these rules.
According to the OHA, inner - open jobs include those activities that require regular or close contact between six 1.8 m) and unknown people who are considered to be COVID-19 patients, who have the SARS-CV-2 virus because of constant friction in a society near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned to a foreign country that is a mixed with COVID-19.
These include users who have social contact with the public as public schools, high - profile operating systems, and high operating systems. To create control systems for these high - risk groups includes installing super-level environments, lifting the vastilation level, installing controls as platforms, and install a window pass by the Internet service. Working on this side-level workgroups includes inviting sick crews to stay home, inserting a network connection system to take up the superstructing platforms, set up remote controls, set limits for environments, and traffic control control control control, environments, and environments, and traffic control control control control systems, environment settings, environment settings, and environment settings, and environments, and environment systems to use the Internet configuration systems, and traffic control control control systems to use the Internet configuration, and traffic control control control systems, and traffic control control control control systems, and environments, and traffic control control control control control control control control control control control systems, and environment settings, and environment systems, and the Internet systems, and traffic control control control control control control control systems to use Internet systems, and environment systems, and Internet systems to use Internet systems, and Internet systems to use the Internet devices and Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems, and Internet systems to monitors that monitors that monitors that monitor systems, and Internet Internet systems to use traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic systems, and Internet systems, and Internet systems, and how how how to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to navigate about how how to use Internet systems to navigate and how to use Internet systems to use Internet devices and how to navigate and how to navigate and how to navigate and how to navigate and how to navigate and how to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to navigate to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet systems to use Internet Internet Internet, and how to use Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet systems to use Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet Internet systems to use Internet systems.

Workers in this group of exposure are rarely required to use charatora.
If a person begins to get sick in a plane, proper control programs for behavior of workers and other passengers include separating the patient from others at a level of 6, putting one crew to care for the patient, and giving a face mask to the patient or asking the patient to cover his mouth and his tears when he falls or sneezes.
A cable cru must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body fluids or areas that may be contaminated, and it may be that more protective equipment is available if the patient is hot, chronic cough, and when breathing is difficult.
Gloves and other wastes should be disposed of in a bottle of bioharard, and areas that have found pollution should be washed and treated later. In the case of the market ships, they include passenger ships and other passenger transport vessels, the control of the cargo includes reducing the journey when you are sick, and isolate yourself and cherish the treatment center as soon as anyone starts hot or other symptoms while it is on board.
If possible, medical tests must be affected by a person who is separated. In schools and day - care facilities, the CDC encourages short - term evaporation for sanitation and detoxification if the infected person is inside the school building, regardless of the spread.
If there is little or no public involvement, social isolation plans may have been started as an introduction to afield trip, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as a natural education, attending classes or eating meals, increasing space between desks, arriving in half and hours of escape, taking advantage of visitors who are not important, and using a different health center for children with flulike symptoms.
When the virus spreads dramatically in the community, despite efforts to keep people away from one another, it may be thought of closed schools. For day - to - day law workers, the health risk is then viewed as lower than the CDC.
Legislature workers who must contact people who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as health - emergency workers, including appropriate safety precautions.
If there is too much contact during contact, workers should wash and remove the germs from their work belts and clothing before reuse them with a spray or cleaning cloth, and they follow traditional methods to prevent the spread of infection and the loss of PPE used and to wash and wash clothes.
The OWA considers that some medical and cold workers are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The services of the emergency victims include medical agents, relief goods, laboratory personnel, and health - care workers who are exposed to known patients or who are suspected of having COVID-19.
These become the greatest risk of infection when workers develop techniques that form aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The mechanisms that introduce aerosol include the inserting of tubes in the body, processes causing cough, bronchoscopies, certain procedures and dental tests, or the body’s collecting of samples.
High - risk cold activities include employees involved in preparing bodies for known or suspect cases of COVID - 19 when they die; these become particularly dangerous when examining bodies. The additional engineers of these dangerous groups include private - room rooms known to patients who are or suspect that they have COVID-19, which include the development of aerosol.
Special airway pressure may be appropriate for some medical and cold - weather satellites.
Samples should be covered with the Biosafeity Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that arriving patients be separated into waiting sites that are different from whether they have COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, the OWA is encouraging prespirators for those working apart from those who are known, or are suspected, that they have SARS-CIV-2 virus, and those who develop aerosol.
In the United States, N95 facial deformators authorized by NIOSH or better should be used as a standardized means of complete despirators, which involves a medical examination of health, exercise, and medical examination.
Some types of despirators can more protect and improve the user's well-being. WHO does not promote coverals, because COVID-19 is a disease that is injected and not through the body’s passing fluid.
WHO only encourages surgery for surgical personnel in the entry area.
For those who collect smoke samples, careers, or transport COVID-19 patients without the techniques of aerosol, WHO encourages surgery masks, mirrors, or face shield, gloves, and gloves.
When aerosol is invented, N95 is replaced by FFP2-perator instead of the operating scan.
Because PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing PPE need by telephone contacting patients, virtually shutters such as windows showing it, which allow only those directly involved in treating treatment to enter a patient with COVID-19, use only the required PPE, continue to use the same reperator without removing it while caring for many patients, watch and control the presence of PPE people without symptoms.

PHATHER: [Covid-19] Reduce the load and plan for the future
DAY/OWENDS: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: CCD: No privileges denied
We find ourselves in a very different situation during this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a factor that makes it clear how people in the world are linked to the burden we have on each other.
We have never experienced such challenges, but we know that our reaction is based on the kind of compassion that exists on earth, cooperation, and the built - in social structure of this society.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees by means of e-mail, telephones, and conversations is a remarkable proof that we have good people with whom we are privileged to work.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me of how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia now, and this most powerful symbol is the source of its regular access to the Internet and is available to everyone.
Your work is doing this, whether it is good to keep a schedule or to keep our employees in charge or our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, now more than ever before.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will affect the world.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make big changes in our dealings with one another, starting with our new mate from the very beginning.
Changes in our work with checks
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the thug-c has met tomorrow night and discussed how we will work with our cheese for the days and months to come.
In that discussion, we considered what we had felt would be the best response to the situation and the best way to keep the organization moving forward during this time.
We could not expect to remove stress and support our long - term goal.
If you need to retrace your steps again, that is fine.
For all the workers, the contract companies, and the contract workers:
Our expected daily job will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not advertise holidays — if you are able to work longer hours, a company may use them.
However, things are not going well in the world today, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy food, or consult a doctor, your health comes first.
We will not pursue it for any time.
If you are sick, don’t work.
There is really no need to say this, but we will say it.
You don't have to enter your sick days or PTO - will simply tell your manager and help your staff to recompliant calendars and check checks to make sure that key parts of the work are done.
( If you are diagnosed with COIV-19 virus, please tell Bryan among the T&C Ops so that the T&C can help by supporting and ensuring that your situation is properly cared for by the administrator).
Full - time employees will be well paid.
We have already said, and we are stinging to fulfill our obligations to our hired employees and those who work hours.
Everyone will be paid according to his normal hours of work in normal conditions.
This includes when you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of bringing their stress into harmony with the environment.
What we do can be a great reward, especially at times like this.
Again, it is important that you take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we know what we can expect and then plan accordingly.
Another job is viewed as important.
There are still things that we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundrasis (among others) perform a crucial task that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all the doors to explore current goals and expand our focus on supporting what is vital to our goal.
All of us have much to do, but we will only focus on the main project.
Reflexing our pace now will not harm us later.
We don't plan "work double to hold the shell" when the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to finish at a particular time at this time.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and times when it is convenient.
What happens to the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adjust to our new circumstances and to the hours of work we expect each day, we intend to change the timing of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our aim is to suggest an extension of our 2019-20 program that allows more time to make a bill allowing workers to do difficult tasks first, to care for themselves, and to care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work a reduced check in the next few weeks.
This expansion of the working period greatly reduces the work schedule now and the pressures that are in the rest of the organization.
We will introduce what we are suggesting to Bod the next week and reward the representatives and the hosts at the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
We thank the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office status, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF operators may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, because of extreme anxiety, we sent a group of cleaning agents to clear away germs from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use an antibacterial spray to remove germs everywhere, as well as in the reception area and in laboratory areas.
The building uses its maintenance protocol by using products that support the safety of its accounts.
We feel at ease that the office will be fine when we decide to return to it.
Our DC office is at We Work, which shares with us its COVID-19 protocol as well as all the users on the DC.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area that has been completely cleared in accordance with the direction given to San Francisco.
As some of our NYC staff knew, we had been talking about renting a place in Brooklyn.
The conversations persist but may take time.
For the first time, some of our employees were very busy.
Our longtime employees know that it can be a big change, and they want to give you advice:
Reduce the meeting length by at least one or two hours.
If long gatherings are needed, give thought to how they might be divided over the course of several days.
Point out that the meeting is about you, take a goa, and send out the items that should be studied in advance.
Do this with video, with such tools as Google Docs and Zoom to work around and connect to each other.
Have someone take the lead in arranging all the meetings, someone who will look at the questions in the discussions and follow up on the lines of communication, and someone who will help in writing notes (or write all of you notes).
Send an email to those who support technology support you in need of a good cassette.
Use your savings to buy expensive jewelry.
Win the #remotics channel in the Blackjack to discuss the work you are sending
The HR Operations user needs guidance on the Internet in effective working methods to support the growth of missions sent to the entire Company.
In the previous report we asked all who received back money in society to give public coverage to social events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as reditathons, WHO even announced that the epidemic was over.
We will tell them that we have come to understand that our request for enlightenment and other restrictions can make it impossible to finish the course of their investment and that no one will be paid for them by delay or by changing those goals.
In this coming report we will follow further direction to Wikimania and other public relations in the state and sector.
The general sense of society in the world seems to be a frustration with disorder but a relief from being defined and the opportunities to focus on their societies, Wikimedia, and so forth.
In time, the CRTC works to type the page to Meta-Wiki to give a public position so that you can check the impact and follow our conversations with them.
Keeping in touch with news related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars on the next Thursday, at 14 UTC/00 for a special task meeting of the workers.
We will take advantage of this opportunity to share some of your expenses, to answer your questions, and to communicate with each other for a while.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
Currently, you can continue receiving information in this mail, as well as all other essential CEVID-19 related information, in your Free Software Foundation.
CRTC will save these restore pages and all information at the same location.
We also work to keep regular contact with the workers who live in the most affected countries.
If you have questions about travel, events, the main job route, the bridge challenge, and anything else you may need to help, please be quick to tell and work with CRT.
We are here to assist with support and communication when needed.
If you have a confidential or serious matter, please send an email to Bryan Judah - the HR International Global Tasks.
None of these changes are to be taken as personal relief from our work and our commitments.
Rather, they are keeping in mind that at this time, our work and obligations will likely need to be updated as never before.
These steps that are believed to be necessary to support one another in order to carry on the work, to give our group the support they need, and to give the world to your trust.
The work we have planned will be ready for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is a time for mutual support and a time for the important work that may exist in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to do that, so we need to look after ourselves and our families so that you are fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please - reach your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Banda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doryen, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Major Party (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime, Jaime W, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Angziotin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the inner enzyme (in the cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, muscles, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is against the operation of anteotinin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of anteotensen-III and raising Ang(1-7) to make it a promising drug for treating heart and blood diseases. ACE2 also acts as a place to enter the cells in some coronavirus.
The human-type of the enzyme is commonly referred to as hAC2.
Anteotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme with a enzyme found in the face of endotheial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal pepide M2 and C-terminal collectin renal amino acid (transparent).
ACE2 is a protein of a joint I-type I, with its enzymes that operate on the face of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane in the enzyme known as sheddasse, and the resulting dissolved protein is absorbed into the blood and finally results in the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body organs: ACE2 is associated with a cell cell primarily with the cell cell cell of the type of analvelar, tiny terocytes, arterial and vaginal cells, and the venotheal cells of the arterial cells in most cells.
ACE2 RNA is also found in iceral cortex, stritum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2 primary function is to act as ACE's letter.
ACE divides anteotin I into avisory angotin II.
ACE2 split carboxy-terminal amino ped from annguoten II (Asppg-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ppe) and divides it into vasodolator ambiotsin (1-7), (HH-Arpp-Arg-Til-Tyr-Ile-Pro-POH).
ACE2 can also distinguish a number of pepides involving [des-Arg9]-bradykin, apelin, naurotensin, dynorphin A, and rrelin.
ACE2 also controls the flow of autral amino acid (LL619) fluid and is included in Hartnup disease.
As a proteintransmmbrane, ACE2 acts as a primary entry area in certain coronavirus cells, which involves HCV-NL63; SARS-CIV (SARS); and SARS-CIV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Directly, a combination of SARS-CIV SARS-CV and SARS-CV2 on the ACE2 enzyme on the front of cells results in endocytics and in the course of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes between cells.
This procedure also requires that Sprotein be reused by the protease TMPRSS2, a block under the current test as a cure for the disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 tablets, in cells, can be helpful in combating the virus.
However, many of the major organizations and working bodies have encouraged continued with the general ACE ban and ARV treatment.
"Recordation and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "using ACE preventives was associated with a major reduction of 34% in pneumonia risk compared with the controls." "
"Despite," pneumonia's risk has been reduced to patients treated with ACE vaccines who were at greater risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart disease."
"The use of ACE preventives has also been linked to a decrease in pneumonia patients, although the effects have been less serious than the damage that pneumonia can cause."
ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new approach to increased lung damage, and it seems to improve pulmary hemodynamics to release oxygen from pigs containing the polylysacid-incid respiration disorder.
A half of the rhACE2 per person takes 10 hours to work and starts working 30 minutes later than the 24-hour (time).
According to one study, rhACE2 can be a suitable drug for those who are unable to take normal renovators (RAS inhibitors) or disease when anguotsin II is increasing. BhCE2 has been tested in a medical study on a form of diaspiratory disease.
"Accaps for b'COD-19 are the software software software programs designed to help you find numbers regarding the 2019-20 Coronavirus epidemic, as a means of finding people (" touched") that may have been contacted with an infected person.
A number of programs have been developed or considered, with the backing of government legislation in some places.
Synonyms have been developed to build the desired searchers.
A secret concern has been raised, especially in regard to the system-based tracking location of the applet users.
Other methods that do not require secret information include the use of gears in Bluetooth to replace the user’s position with other youths.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they were going to build the route to support such programs in Bluetooth directly to the OS in Andoid and the IOS.
In China, the Chinese government, working with Alipway, has developed an app which allows citizens to check if they have had contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a wave called TraceTogether is used.
"This app was started by local IT's staff, published as an open spring and will be given to the government. In North Macedonia a "Stop Korona" was released "Stop Korona!"", the app that works through Bluetooth to pursue attention to people who may be infected and given quick response to health authorities."
Ap is established by the Communications and Health Services Department.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was expected to be authorized by the Google Play Store and the Apple Applet.
"On the day of April 12, the government said that the search for man's identity was in a advanced stage of development, and it was to be obtained in a few weeks. The same aap is prepared in Ireland, and in France ("Stop Covid "")."
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the pleases based on the Singapore’s TraceToger and the Blue Trace protocol. Russia aims to develop an accolades showing when a person cross the limits set for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are out of the home.
Ross Anderson, professor of defense at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential problems with the app's masts, which include misleading warnings and the chances of getting a warning if the app’s powers are limited to a small number of people.
"In order to resolve problems related to the rise of the application "e-cornavirus" is misleading or dangerous, the Applet places on the types of organizations that can insert corronavirus on its App freedorrus, said it would be those of "licent" or only trusted institutions."
Google and Amazons have developed similar boundaries.
Secretists express their concern about the problems of tracking the majority of people using coronavirus appends, especially in the case of a search program designed to handle the coronavirus epidemic when the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have produced a statement that limits this type of search.
These agencies have set up nine restrictions on government projects:
"Regulation should be "" legal, necessary and appropriate"*
the extension of the period of watch and exploration should have subjects of sunset;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of the CEVID-19;
The protection of the data and unknown names will need to be protected and displayed as evidence-based protection;
a distorted study should avoid reducing the effects of prejudice and reducing the value of things;
any matter of sharing in the meal with the people shall be declared legally;
should be on guard against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"A useful sharing in a useful way is for all "particular" ones, which includes social health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (Reporter hyne Gkzen) (RSF) will also produce tests.
The proposed Google/Apple program aims to address the disorder of being followed regularly by launching a search work on the OS client when you are no longer needed.
Some countries were using search for space based on a network rather than with aap, which eliminates both the need to sign the app and avoid following after.
In Israel, neighbors-based tracking was granted.
Tacts based on the network that can reach the continent’s garbage can have serious secret problems.
Not all masts, however, have big Web sites to find access to a local grave; the number of syms protecting the secret has been built using supercomputers only for contact (see the subsection below).
In South Korea, a mast that is not based on the app was used for man's tracking.
Instead of using a built-up, the symmetry builds a search information from various sources that involves the sequence of a small computer and a card card card, and combines this to send announcements with text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn people who may be infected with the virus, the government has also made public knowledge available for the public, which is approved by many changes to secret laws after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public by the App and the Index. The countries involving Germany consider using both large and secret simonys.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
A search for privacy is a well-programmed method, with dozens of research publications dating back at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than 12 groups of experts have been looking for solutions that accept the secret, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user with other youths.
However, PPPP-PT is an attempt to connect with both major and varied methods, and not just one protocol. Various protocols include Decentrad Privacy-PVerving Protocol (DPPPT/DP/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numerators (TCN, BestCN), Proculation Projects, and Mechanisms for Contact Tracing (PAT) and others.
In these proteins, man’s visible net never leaves a peek, and all the link taking place is to break down.
The MIT Media Lab has been developing Safety Paths, a platform to use coded codes when collectioning and using a transverse space or channel to follow the expansion of COVID-19.
"It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Inteinating Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. One same attempt is the SaphETrace stand of the Enigma MPC, a company that introduces the code technology that was first developed in MIT Media Lab.."
SaphETrace uses security technology to allow users to share the critical local and health data with other users and legal authorities, without risking the data of the accident.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups associated with what had been the same course as the vast diversity of proteins, with the goal of reducing divisions, and allowing worldwide application of the accups to explore and warn, an important feature in general acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced an invitation for the Blue Trace protocol that is used by its official government extension.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the firms that control Andoroid and the IOS youth platforms, announced how to track people, and asserted that they would protect the secret, based on the code of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography.
They also published technical features used in the mast.
In harmony with the Apple and Google, the mast is intended to be removed in three stages:
the production of equipment to allow governments to build legal laps that capture the corronavirus protected
to address this factor directly to the IOS and the Andoid Google and Apple programs to correct ongoing problems of starting and monitoring by sending the system first with the OS returns, and then releasing it in the same way as when the threat has passed.
B'Drug reposition (also known as reuse of medicine, reprofiling, re-asking, or a parapeuctic self) is to reuse the prescribed medicine to treat another disease or health condition that is different from what it was designed to do.
This is the kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safer and more effective methods of treating COVID-19.
Other research guides include the establishment of the COVID-19 goal and the use of transvalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CV-2 contains about 66 proteins capable of taking medication, each with a large number of channels to meet molecules.
An analysis of those meeting sites creates a logical project to develop an antibiotic against the COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important proteins in SARS-CV-2 is a protein such as papain, RNA polymerase based on RNA, helicase, Sprotein, and ADP  ribphosphatase.
The Hussen A, others, studied several drugs that could be used and then improved the similarity of its building with the same high - quality drug to speed up the development of a powerful treatment drug for SARS-CV-2 in this pre-summeric study.

nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (original of Part I and a set of goals: Modernna, MRNA 1273)
viral vrector (first of Part I) and a set of goals: Canno Biologics, adinovirus type 5 bector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 cassettes are in the first stages of the goal, and 78 are confirmed as infected technologies (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 have been announced, but little public information available (which may be planned or invented).
III’s research tests before the use and fight infection, usually planned, controlled by a bullet, and in most institutions, while more accurate, effective levels are considered.
The study of Article III often involves additional helpers, including the control team, and the effectiveness of a program to prevent the disease, while serious side effects are handled in the right amount.

The chairmans quoted from the leaders of various chat rooms refer to the already existing chairmans of the genetic code and the goals of other corronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
The b 'Coronavirus 2019' virus (COVID-19) is a infectious virus caused by a respiritory system system system that is called 2 (SARS-CIV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and coughing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throats, nausea, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in the symptoms of disease, others result in ongoing pneumonia and the death of many organs.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have recovered. The virus is spread primarily among people contacting one another, usually by small droplets that come out when you cough, sneeze, or talk.
Although these droplets appear during breathing, they often fall to the ground or to the surface rather than to the surface.
People may also be infected with the virus and touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive for about 72 hours.
It is more closely related during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it can spread before the onset of symptoms and later phases of the virus. The usual method of testing is the reverse presupposition polymerase channel reaction (RT-PCR) through the cane.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
Opinions that society as a whole use of skiki are different, some authorities say that it is not used, others say that it is not used, and others are demanding that it be used.
Currently, there is no specific target or treatment against the COVID-19 virus.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries in all six WHO areas.
Those infected may have no symptoms or have such symptoms as fever, fever, fatigue, and backbone.
Symptoms of an emergency may include respiratory trouble, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and a mild face and lips; they are encouraged to seek the doctor’s help immediately if these symptoms are identified.
Strangely, signs of breathing above, such as nose, nose, or throat, may be visible.
Symptoms of the disease from the mouth to the hips like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed by a number of percent.
Some events in China first developed only chest intensity and heartbeat.
In some cases, disease can spread into pneumonia, killing many organs, and causing death.
This is also called the era of symptoms.
The period of symptoms of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those with symptoms develop within 11.5 days of infection. The reports show that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role these who do not have symptoms in transmitting disease is not yet fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of people who do not show the symptoms of the disease is now known and studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected patients have not been infected during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases of nondiagnosing disease in its daily numbers on 1 April 1; of 166 infected on that day, 180 (78%) were not screened.
Both gestation and saliva can involve the virus.
Extensive comments produce more drops than normal speech.
Research in Singapore has found that a cough without a covering can lead to a tube of about 15 feet [4.5 m].
Although the virus may not normally be transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by inhalation and air-cushion containers outside human rooms produce tested samples of RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as cadiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause the production of crystals to be removed from the air and result in a rise in exposure.
While there is concern about the spread of the disease, the danger is thought to be minimal. The virus becomes more common when people have symptoms; although an outbreak may occur before symptoms of disease appear, the risk is minimal.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet fully clear how easy it is to develop the virus, one person usually infects two or three people. The virus lives for hours on things.
In particular, it was found that the virus lives one day on a board, about three days in plastic (pollypropylene) and iron (Asis 304), and about four hours in the space of 99%.
This vary, however, in humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be useful if used properly; soap products reduce the immune membrane of the virus, kill it, and remove it from the skin and elsewhere.
Other soaps, such as bealconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (the antibiotic of the surgical site), are in use. In Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken two days after first hospitalization.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed the number of the virus at high levels, and the sixth patient showed the number of the virus on the second day under test.
Savere acre respiratory system cornavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very serious form of respiratory corronavirus, starting with three cases of pneumonia that were associated with many very serious respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CV-2 virus are from corronavirus.
When out of the human body, the virus is killed by a household soap, which emits its own protective tube. SARS-CV-2 is closely related to SARS-CV.
The lungs are the most affected parts in COVID-19 because the virus enters the primary cells by a enzyme called anguotin-conceining enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in large quantities in the type of anveular cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called "i-spike" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 and enter into the main cell."
The most serious heart damage was found in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized at the hospital in Wuhan, China, and are more likely to be in serious cases.
High levels of Cardiovascular symptoms, resulting in slums and immune infections during the rise of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are more visible in the heart and are involved in the working of the heart.
Phombololosis (31%) and renous thromboelism (25%) are found in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to a weak prognosis. The diagnosis of victims of COVID-19 has shown diffuse alvelar magge (DAD), and lymphocyte fever.
Although SARS-COV-2 has an ACE2-expressing type of respiratory respiration, patients with a critical COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinfmation.
In particular, Gthongic GM-CSF-selecting T-cells appear to be in harmony with the discovery of IL-6-selecting monocytes and the causes of serious disease in the lungs of patients with COVID-19.
Gymphocytic infilrates has also been reported.
WHO has published a number of microbi protocols.
The usual method for testing is the transmission protocol channel channel reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests are usually made in samples of breath samples obtained from the breast moth; however, a nose tube or sputum sample can also be used.
The results are usually obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but this requires two samples of blood taken within two weeks and the results have little value at the time.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the corronavirus and to produce a genetic sequence so that bacteria around the world can develop a polymerase channel reaction (PCR) test to identify the virus.
Since April 4, 2020, a genetic study (which may find active bacteria and if one has ever developed the virus) has been developed, but it has not been widely used.
Chinese studies show that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved the initial medical study on 21 March 2020 that was used at the end of that month. Test guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested ways to identify the virus based on the aspects of treatment and the risk of treatment.
Biltimer mutibal grouping-glabis spread with perimeter, assymmetric and polynometers common to infection.
Sub-procession,crazy poving (velobular reserpal by varicial conditioning), and consulation may appear as the disease progresses.
Small data is available through microscopic glasses and on a COVID-19 protocol.
The main causes found in the study are the following:
Microscopy: pleurisy, pericarditics, pungention and pulmary odema
Four types of weight of pneumonia can be seen:
Normal hormone: pulmary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia,lage atypical pneucytes, interstitial inflamation inflammatic infomatic infilation and multilititation
critical hormone: mouse alvelar diamond (DAD) and mouse alvelar hedades.
DAD is the cause of an acuate respiratory system (ARDS) and a form of hypoxemia.
treated hormone: an Epididate combination on analveular cavities and pulmary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Reservation integration (DIC); Leukorythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce infection include staying in the home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, adapting to mouth and nose hygiene, and avoiding eye contact, nose, or mouth with unsparented hands.
The CDC encourages closeing the mouth and nose when coughing or coughing and encourages the use of the inside of the tube when it is not available.
Proper hand washing after coughing or sneezes is encouraged.
The CDC promotes the use of masking cloth while in public, in part to reduce the infection from people who do not have the symptoms of the virus. Social isolation techniques are intended to reduce contact with infected people and large groups by closed schools and workshops, preventing travel and lighting large gatherings.
The boundaries of distance include that people are always separated by at least 6 feet (1.8 m).
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 1921 at least, the foremost means of controlling COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those who are infected, called "" to make the line clear."
The CDC also encourages people to wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating and after breakfast, coughing and coughing.
It also encourages the use of at least 60% of alcohol hand pipe, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand tires are not easily available, WHO provides two ways to produce them in the area.
In these ways, the antemibilal function comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; "It's not "eascable" for handwashing".
Glycerol is inserted to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include chemotherapy, oxygen therapy, and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having a virus wear a normal face mask.
ECMO (ECMO) has been used to solve respiratory problems, but its benefits are still considered.
Hygiene, health care, and healthful food have been encouraged to avoid infection.
Physical therapy may be helpful to those who have recently contracted HIV - positive symptoms. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions to care for patients in a hospital with COVID-19.
Intensivists and polynologists in the U.S.A. have combined treatment methods from various alternatives to free source, IBC.
Since April 2020, there is no way to treat COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of bubprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting infection to one another, especially in medical areas where procedures may produce aerosols, such as integration or hang vitilation.
For physicians caring for patients with COVId-19, the CDC encourages a person’s being stored in Airbone Infectionion (AIR) over the use of conventional measures, to prevent contact and exposure of the virus. The CDC defines the guidelines for the use of precession action (PPPE) during an epidemic.
What is required: PPE, prepirator or facial mask, eye protection, and doctor gloves. When available, prepirators are encouraged (in place of eye masks).
N95 respirators are authorized to be used in factories but FDA has authorized masks to be used under Emergency Use Administration (EUA).
It is designed to protect it from particles in the air as dust, but protection from a particular body chain is not guaranteed in its use.
If masks are not found, the CDC suggests using wave shiells or, if no other method is available, automation masks.
Many COVID-19 conditions are not too bad to require metanical vetilation or other methods, but some are needed.
A form of breathing support for those with respiratory problems related to COVID-19 is still being studied by hospital patients, and there is some evidence that initation can be avoided with high fever and sal cannlula or bi-level radiation.
Whether these two things lead to the same benefit to people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to live with metabolic ventilation because this method reduces the spread of hydraulic particles when compared with high fever and sal canlula. The most serious conditions are common among adults (over 60, especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduce the number of cases causing the failure to handle the unexpected rise in the number of people with COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
One survey in China found that 5% were installed in a horrible environment, 2.3% needed vitilitation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of patients in a hospital with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Ventilation devices become more complex as the acuate respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) developed in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with high stress-control modes and PEPs are needed to increase the availability of oxygen while reduced the risk of damage to the lungs associated with ventilators and pneucorax.
PEEP may not be found on oldventators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs in medical research.
Remdesir is likely to be effective.
Although by 1921 new drugs are already being developed, several of the drugs being tested are already authorized to use another or are already improved to the test.
Antiviral drugs can be tried by people with a serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to participate in medical research and safety of drugs that can be used to treat treatment. FDA has established for a brief period a transvalescent plasma as a treatment studied in cases where man has become infected.
He has not been involved in the medical research needed to prove that he is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, China was introduced to a cell application to handle the outbreak of the virus.
Users were asked to enter a name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'if you are close to a person' using a test chart that can be dangerous to infection.
All users can check the condition of three other users.
If a potentially dangerous situation appears, aap not only encourages isolation, but also warns health authorities. Reviews of a vast array of data about a young tie, face - to - face technology, cell phones, and introduced information are used in transporting infected people and infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government authorized security agencies to follow a telephone chain of people thought to have coronavirus.
This is done to set them apart from the community and to protect those who may have contact with infected residents.
In March 2020, Deututsche Telekom shared with the German government’s telephone and mail, Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the infection.
Russia developed face - to - face awareness technology to find those who break the laws of social separation.
"The Italian minister of health, Giulio Galela, said you were told by young workers that ""-40% of the people are going around."
The German government has conducted a 48-hour computer - breaking campaign on the weekend of the 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kerti Kaljulaid, has made a national declaration of solutions to prevent the explosion of the coronavirus.
People may face the stresses of isolation, of being prevented from walking, of ill health, or of being infected by the virus themselves.
"BC has broken down by Rony O'Connor says, "A continuing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic collapse is a storm that poisons people's minds and their well-being."
The virus may have fewer or less symptoms, compared with some common respiratory infections such as common cold.
Common occurrences have been cured within two weeks, while those infected with a serious or a severe infection may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at greater risk of COVID-19 on the basis of data from other similar bacteria, such as SARS and MES, but COVID-19 is missing. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those most affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into a form of a transpiratory system (ARDS) causing damage to the respiratory, subsized shock, or multiple organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include seps, abnomal specialization and heart injury, kidney and liver damage.
Sclotting amortis, especially an increase of prothromin time, are found to 6% of those who are hospitalized because of COVID-19, while kidney failure is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show high liver enzymes (trassamines).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of the symptoms and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transmitted to the ICU have been about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the amount of time from the first symptoms to the death was 14 days, a total of six to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% while the death rate for women is 1.7%.
Hexophymatic hydraulics are samples of a bone-searching of the lungs that show a fibromyr and cellular fibroyxoids in both lungs.
The change of thevial cytopathic appeared in praumocytes.
A lung image showed an acuate respiratory system (ARDS).
Of 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted for high levels of tropopan or heart condition.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of those who were hospitalized were already ill. The availability of medical and social factors can contribute to deaths.
The rate of deaths due to a virus varies from place to place, but also because of the difficulty in the methods used.
A few of the worst conditions can cause the average deaths to exceed expectations.
However, the fact that death is the result of previous infectious cases may mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers have at least 1.4 times the risk of detecting symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times as many cases of emergency care or death compared with nonsmokers. Concern about long - term diseases has been developed.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority has discovered a 20% to 30% reduction in the activity of lungs in some infected people, as well as lung scans that indicate that it may be injured.
This can also lead to a after - intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could help to provide effective and long - term protection for patients who recovered from the virus.
Protection from the virus appears to be possible, based on other coronaviruss, but cases have been reported in which the recovery of COVID-19 has been followed by a gentle check of coronavirus later.
These conditions are thought to be spread rather than re - infected.
The virus is thought to have evolved from an animal, and it infects humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was likely guided completely by its transmission from person to person.
A survey of 41 of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in Lancet, indicated that the first day of the outbreak was December 1, 2019.
The official WHO documents reported that the symptoms of the first disease occurred on December 8, 2019.
Several methods of counting deaths are widely used.
The numbers vary from circuit to district and from generation to generation and depend on the quality of tests, acupunctures, medical methods, time from the early onset and characteristics of people such as age, sex, and health.
Toward the end of 2019, WHO distributed emergency records at ICD-10, U007.1 killed by the SARS-CoV-2 - 2 virus and U02 killed by COVID-19 prepared by medical and screening without the SARS-CV-CV-2 confirmed virus. The mortality rate rather than the virus is indicated by the number of deaths produced during a given period.
According to figures of Johns Hopkins University, the world's mortality rate over the virus is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) on April 17, 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Some methods include cataactityrate (CFR), which indicate the percentage of carefully handled persons who are killed by the virus, and infected sleeprate (IFR), which indicates that percentages of people who are infected (or not prepared) are killed by the virus.
These statistics are not based on time and follow the number of individuals from infection to problem solving.
Although not all infected are infected, the presence of a disease - causing gene can provide information on how many people are infected.
In an area where most people are infected in Italy, Castigline d'Adda, a small area of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangalt, the virus was spread by the Carnival parties, and it entered the young, resulting in lower death rates, and not all patients who died of COVID-19 were officially recognized as infected.
Moreover, Germany’s health system is still relatively low in numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent may be infected with the disease, as blood donors have studied.
64 (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have been killed by COVID-19.
The effects of an epidemic and the mortality rate vary from one man to another.
The death toll is high among men in a survey conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest danger for men is when they are 50, and the gap between men and women closes only to 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The underlying reasons for this difference are unknown, but genetic and behavior factors may be the cause.
The gender difference between the sexually transmitted virus, the low number of commonly smoked women and men who experience other symptoms such as hypertension can contribute to a high mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected are males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US government does not follow the sex data related to the COVID-19 virus.
Studies indicate that rising diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have many opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official bug's name would be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Director Teds Addanom Gebreyes explained that CO represents corona, V represents virus, D represents disseasse, and 19 means the year marked the first outbreak: December 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen not to be named after a specific area (such as China), of the species or group of people, according to the proposals of different countries to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a severe a break effect system zone 2 (SARS-CIV-2).
"WO again uses "" COVID-19" and "A" virus that causes COVID-19" in public conversation."
"Both sickness and disease are often called "coronavirus".
"Between the first outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "a-coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCIV respiratory disease as names that will be used for germs and disease in accordance with the guidelines of 2015 against using sites in names of disease and bacteria.
Legal terms COVID-19 and SARS-CIV-2 are published on February 11, 2020.
Because of the lack of products in the industrial industry, some industrial manufacturers are producing such medical products as moths and vantilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needs velve, and the surgeon could not send it at the time required, the local company used its equipment and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, speculations, false and misleading stories emerged regarding the origin, development, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread to the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the presence of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no known cure or potential for the disease.
International research on goals and medicines is conducted by government agencies, schools, and industrial researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization began "Shortful Research" to examine the results of the four antiviral treatment of the existing virus with great hopes that it will work."
No vaccine is available, but various types of needles are working to develop vaccines.
The previous SARS-CIV operation is used because SARS-CIV and SARS-CIV-2 both use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three methods of prevention are studied.
First, researchers intend to build a vaccine against the virus.
The aim of using a virus such as this, inactive or dead, is to develop the body’s response to the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, sobunit vaccides, aims to set a goal that enables the immune system to respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If SARS-CIV-2, such research focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third option is the nucleus of nucleic acid (sets of DNA or RNA, a new method of setting a goal).
The goals that are studied in any of these methods will have to be tested for safety and work. On March 16, 2020, the first medical research on this subject began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains a code of genes that is not a threat to a disease - causing virus. The development based on the genes has been proposed as a challenge to the establishment of the SARS-COV-2 goal, but this is not confirmed.
There are more than 300 medical studies going on since April 2020.
Seven studies have already been conducted on the treatment already approved for malaria, including four hyxychloroquine or chloroquine research.
Antiviral drugs form a major part of research in China, and a nine study of the third class of remdesivir in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
A powerful return to the development of the medical goal of COVID-19 and nonprescription drugs had begun, in April 2020. A number of antiviral drugs available are studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesir, chroquinne, and hydroxychloroquine,lovir/ritavir and opinavir.
There was physical evidence of the integrity of the remdevir function, in March 2020.
The progress in the treatment of patients that is evident in the use of sufficient remdesivir.
A medical study of the Type III is conducted in the US, China, and Italy. chloroquine, once used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, the results of research are being proposed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend chloroquine to be used.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while encouraging the daily volume of a quarter of an ounce, notes that the volume is twice as high as possible and can kill.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA granted permission to be used in emergency situations for the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine through the observation of physicians dealing with COVID-19. The seven Chinese programs included interferon, himifavir, or imifinvir for treating COVID-19.
Unauthorized data indicates that high readings of libabilin are required to prevent SARS-CIV-2 from in vitro.
Tynoxonides has been suggested for a continuing vivol research after showing the weakened SARS-CoV-2 ban. Research shows that the first rise in the protein priming through thetransmbrane wheel 2 (TMPRS2) is essential to SARS-CV-2 in the relationship with the ACE2 block.
The study of chlororoquine and hydroxychloroquine and without it has large or large limits that prevent the medical community from getting this treatment without further research. Oseltamavir does not prevent SARS-CIV-2 on vitroro and has an unknown role in treating COVID-19.
Cytokine systemm may be a problem in later stages of COVID-19 very serious.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can have anti-cytokine system. Tolcizumab has been added to treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a brief investigation.
A 2-dependic study was conducted in the Italian field after showing the serious effects on people with serious illness.
Linked to a blood test of serum ferritin for cytokines stroms, intended to prevent this development, which is thought to be the cause of certain deaths.
interleukin-6 receptor anganganst was authorized by FDA on previous research in treating steroid refractory cytokine syndrome, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no random, controlled evidence that tolikizumab is effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of hydraulic antibodies produced by the body of those who are recovering in COVID-19 to those in need is considered as a method that does not need to prevent partial immunity.
This method was tried in SARS and the results are unknown.
The prosthesis is the expected method in which a limited medical approach may lead to prevention against SARS-CV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytoxicity based on the genes and/or phagocytics, can occur.
Other methods of treating the elements of the disease, for example, are developed with the same cells.
The production of natural serum, which contains a blood component from the right patients and is related to the virus, can be lifted to use quickly.
Coronavirus, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenling, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after assisting in the spread of the virus.
