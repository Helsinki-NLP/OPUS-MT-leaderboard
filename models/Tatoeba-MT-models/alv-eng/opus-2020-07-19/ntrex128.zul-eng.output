Welsh AMMs are concerned that ‘ will look like a mouse'
They ask themselves and answer some among the AMs in the view that the way they are called MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament) has changed.
This is removed by reform programs called the Welsh Parliament.
AMs in all political institutions fear that this calls for ridicule.
One component of the Labour AM said they were afraid because there is the same sound as Twp and Pwp.
For students outside Wales: According to Welsh you mean a fool and pwp means dirt.
The item of platform AM said that as a group the happiest people could not be selected and that they should not have been able to give other names to it.
The Welsh Conservative officer said as a group they were willing to accept a change of name but observed that MWP is too close to being called.
According to Welsh the letter W is the same as the U letter in Yorkshire England.
The Chairman of the Conservative Assembly said: "The final decision by the mention of the members of the law will be a matter of the division of the parties.."
The Welsh Act 2017 granted the Welsh Government authority to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of the open - air polling of the public, which received a great commitment to the movement of the Welsh parliament.
In the case of the AMs commission it established the WMP and the public opinion has indicated reliance on the MWP.
The Ams also introduced their own ideas, but this conflict will be a problem for Elin Jones, who is responsible for the formation of the policy of a change law in the following weeks.
The laws of compensation will involve a change in the operation of acupuncture, including the law of the amendment of the AM and the order of the cups.
An AM shall have a final voice in the matter of what it shall be called in the law.

"Today, there's no record.

He asserted that the churches could be converted into empty living quarters that would no longer help the remaining congregations.
Most of the people who buy living rooms in these clubs are white people, he continued, "They will make it possible to make the closing of these congregations legally because there is little possibility that they will be members of the church."
Both churches were built in white before Harlem to become the black city of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and became St Martins ten years later.

Some congregation elders wept over the failure of the crates.

This issue shows the difference between ideas about a visitor who appears to be a hero to the German Turks and who as a mother is opposed to others.

Some people climb the trees and run for Tsunami, he says.
About 17,700 persons were taken to 24 stations in Palulu.
Photographs taken by the disaster station showed a number of buildings and shops destroyed, bridges destroyed and collapsed, and a flood - flooded train.
The quake continues to shake the coastal city for the rest of the week.
The series of earthquakes was known in an area of 2.4 million people.

"Tell me that they see many houses destroyed," he said.
It’s very bad.

"I think that means messages are not sent," says."

Once West: he changed his position to Himself.
fo'c'sle Kane West changes its name - Ye.
To announce a change on Saturday, he wrote: "You are known as One.

Mexico’s Amloes do not want to use war against citizens
Mexico’s President Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to use no military force against citizens as the country approaches 50 years of blood attack against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza "Never use soldiers to force Mexicans."
The police were fired in a peaceful presentation on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at that time when the movement of the sofst students was concentrated throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support the young Mexicans by providing full - time services to those who are studying and opening many public universities free of charge.
He says that unemployment and lack of opportunities to learn attract youths to crime.
U.S. must increase the support of A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., U.S. should double the number using research in the field, say financial and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Annotations from after the various sides of the U.S. government made an announcement at AI, as throughout the U.S. plan is not organized.
During that time, China began its program last year: intended to produce 0.1 in AI in 2030.
"AI research assignment will be a good start, for all other countries are still too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success in AI," says Lee.
Conflict with financial support may replay the possibility of major AI achievement in the U.S., and Lee told the CNBC in a discussion of this week.
Lee, her book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Sivont of the Sinotion Ventures, director of one of China's most important industries, Fair +.
In the 1980 ’ s, he worked on a new AI program that became the most visible American Otheillo player, and later became the head of the Microsoft Research and the president of the China Google branch
Lee agreed to the previous U.S. technical competition as the Robotics Challenge Department of Paper and asked when she would be next, to help identify the following industry.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to overcome government policies, says Lee.
"No China removes the academic leaders; they are companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical companies have used lights from the universities to work on AI years later.
Lee said that the changes in the move could also help in the U.S.
"I think the blue cards should be automatically operated on the PhDs to AI," you say.
The Chinese Council of China has issued to promote the next General Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation has poured money out to people at such educational centers as the National Science Foundation and other research agencies, but a professional profession is small in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year. The Defense Department has established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should include the management of this field as well as academics, and the White House has announced the development of a special cup of Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA has announced $2.2.1 in a program called AI Net.
The NSF, has grown to $100 million annually in an AI survey.
Meanwhile, the American National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not yet been ratified by the National Security Commission.
The Macedonians decide whether to change the name of the world or not.
The Macedonians have voted on Sunday to convert the country's name into "The Republic of North Macedonia," a shell to resolve the conflict with the Greek state of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its state, continues that their neighbors on the north side of their route look for their own place and want to enter the NATO and EU.
Both governments sign a signed name, but some say that changing the name means undermining the traditional languages of the Macedonians and Slavs
President Gjorge Ivanov said that they would not agree and that protesting for votes raises the question that 50 percent of the people will arrive until the trip is legitimate.
The question on the vote sheet reads: "You agree with the membership of NATO and the EU by the Greek agreement."
The word converts, according to the Chief Zaran Zaev, say that this is what you now pay for the euros like the EU and Nato in Macedonia, other countries that are experiencing the breakup of Yugoslavia
"I came yesterday to vote for our country’s sas, so that Macedonian youths will live well under the European Union umbrella because it describes all our complete health," says Olivera Georgjevska, 79, Skopje.
In any case, sufficient parliamentary members have decided in favor of a vote by the vote.
The change would require two thirds of the total consumption of a parliamentary joint.
The country’s election commission says that there were no documented cases of contradiction by 1 p.m.
Yet, it has always been 16 percent, with 34 percent of the previous parliamentary votes due in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters signed their votes.
"I have gone out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, voter in town, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted refendum in Macedonia by changing the country's name to join the NATO and European Union in Strucca, Macedonia Seplo 30, 2018.
Before parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing the stadium and sitting in front of the tents set up by those who were to resist rasendum.
"We may have NATO and EU, but we want to join the head, not through the service door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor world, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as in Macedonia, we can convert others as China and Russia and become part of the euro-Asia development.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will bring necessary investment in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 percent of the unemployed.
"I believe that the majority of 80 percent of our citizens will weep with the EU and NATO," says Zaev after the vote.
He said "Yes" results "trusting the certainty of our future."
The envelope was published in Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research and said between 30 and 43 percent of votes to participate – under expected.
Another police guide, who suffers from Macedonia's Telma TV, finds 57 percent of those who respond to them who are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent claim to be vote.
In order for festendum to be a success of those who came, I had a 50 percent per cent and a vote.
A failure in lifendum will present a major problem for the Pro-Western government as long as May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the wall of all Brghton to pick up.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smash down the Brighton wall at the defeat of Manchester City by 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero has made it very easy for his 65 - minute article.
The Argentine marmot is pushed in the stomach at the beginning of the plan.
He tipped over among three of Brighton’s guards, before he passed the court.
Aguro finds himself surrounded by four green hats.
You grab one of the halter before passing another pile through the Brighton box.
Then she cries to the left, finding Sterling.
The fore-playing English has just touched the ball in the box to bring it back to Aguero, who used his right-to-w to conquer Brighton bat Matthew Ryan with an article on the left side of the net.
"Aguero is still facing problems in his feet," Christian administrator Pep Guardiola tells the media.
"We talked to him about playing for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
And we have had a good chance to take the crown in it for a short time.
But it is Sterling that gave the Sky Blues the opportunity at the beginning of the Premire League conference.
The wheel appeared in 29 minutes.
Aguero found a ball in Brighton's bell in that game.
You sent a ball so gently on the left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sande said to touch it before leading Sterling toward the pole.

Scherzer wants to play on popiler facing. Then Rockies
The National Group has been ripped off in a plastic orff competition, and there was no more reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who sits in the challengeer, wishes to enter the stadium on Sunday to face Colorado Rockies, which may be all the more likely if Rockies are facing problems in the plastics, has won a single game by playing Los Angeles Dodgers in the West and NL.
Rockies still hold a single wald-card call by a victory of 5-2 when it is long before the Nationals on Friday day, but they are still looking to hold their first screen divit.
"Denver there is nothing to play, but it remains that once it has reached the Denver class of its followers and one group will be playing at the highest level this year.
What could make me avoid playing there?
The Nationals are not the publishers to play on Sunday, but they seem to let Scherzer enter the contest.
Scherzer, who may have entered about 34, had a bullpen ring on Thursday and will be throwing on Sunday his vacation.
This Washington right-hand operator has 2.53 ERA and 220 strikeouts in 2/3 in the case.
Trump broadcast West Virginia
The president has published his speech in a context surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court when he stressed the importance of the leaving of the Republicans to the internal election and leadership.
"All that we have done is on the stock market in November.
Five weeks before the crucial choice of our health.
This is one of the largest, especially -- I'm not running, but you can say that I'm running so full of all time fighting for the best seats," he said.
Trump has continued, "You see this horrible, shocking group of violent Democrats, that's what you see right now.
And they are determined to return to power in any way they can get it, only to look at cruelty, pollution.
They don't care whom they hurt, and who must be cast on to gain power, is what they want to control and power, which he won't give them."
Democrats, according to him, are in the "Regulation and disruption" campaign.
"If you look at these four days," he says, "and call the Democrats "no more fierce, unclean, and false."
He then refers to the Senate Legal Committee that calls Sen. Democratic Dimit by name, which draws water from the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Enlarge the document?
Oh, yes, I am.
No, at least, it was that one stand has not told me the good news - I have never seen a man’s stand so elaborate."
The work force is no longer a congregation of anyone.
They no longer speak in their mind’s eye.
When the Capitos in our group forced me to close their mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But, I’ve later joined the UN team of workers who have been told that they are not acceptable — simply because of the speech in our thoughts.
My next member of Parliament Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because of opposing the Semics.
In my case, those who wanted to shut up my mouth blamed me for my objection to Jeremy Corbyn.
In the point of the importance of a planned budget, national security, Europe, and other surprising things Jeremy has competed with other leaders ahead.
In the declaration of the Nottingham East's staff group for the Friday convention, we say "We want the meetings to be impartial and enjoyable."
For nearly a year, I am the N of my local staff group, the GC Friday's Friday conferences have been a thing of the past.
Sadly, today, it does not go as normal assemblies and the political promise of ‘ tender and gentle ’ has long been forgotten if, indeed, ever.
It is becoming increasingly evident that differing views are no longer accepted in the Labor Committee and that ideas were judged on whether they were acceptable to the gang leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my siblings, who would say that we have the same political views, have also seen me take sides that I would not agree with — whether in national security or in the limited business of the EU.
Whenever I speak to the public, it’s no longer important and I’m going to come up with a wave of sexual harassment on the Internet that says I’m not expelled, it destroys politics without complaining, saying I’m not a part of the gang.
And I am not alone.
Of course, I know that I have been better off than my neighbors because the talks directed to me still prefer to be political.
I still suspect that those of my siblings are still at work and are not aware of their commitment in the face of sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the most discouraging elements of this political era is the degree of the brutality that has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said that last week Labour party must establish a tradition of restrictions.
The fact is, we no longer see the great church and distrustful of it or the changing of the rules of the burning group.
I have had much counsel for the past two years to be urged to slow down, not to speak too much, and it will be "I'm ready."
But it’s not what I get out of politics.
Since I had met Labour for the past 32 years as a student, I was upset by the government truth that he had left behind the destructive school department, wanting to bring the best public services to those in need – perhaps as a local government or as a minister of the government.
I have never had to hide my identity in politics, including the last one.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way be confused about the law of the determination and the positions of present leadership.
For those who have missed a trip on Friday, all I can say is that when the world moves forward to Brexit that will benefit householders, businesses, and our public service, I do not wish to spend my time and energy honestly with the Master of the Labor Party.
But I really have one message that I have in Nottingham Momentum, to non-infecters, whether members of the Labor, or not: I am free by serving you and also promise that there will be no threat or political means that will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr has 38-17 Melrose: Aymar never lost a seat on the top
Two recent tries have improved the final results, but Ayr is no doubt worthy of commendation for the modern best Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now divine, the betrayal on the side of the ten invincible.
Finally, their defense, whenever possible, put them in place, and the trainer Peter Murchie has every reason to be happy.
He said, "We have been tested up until now, and have never been overcome, so I must rejoice."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Reproach to Ayr, take advantage of every opportunity than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14 - minute star is installed by Frazier Clili, which put forward Ayr, but, cap Roy Hughes of the Soctland got a yellow card, was released from Warriorors's game, which caused Melrose to make it through the eggs and Jason Baggot to hold all the berys.
Climwu'e Ayur went ahead with a pencil, just before, in the first shoro, insert a try to make 17-5 Ayr on a leave.
However, Melrose on the second stage started well and Patrick Anderson's star, fitted with Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then there is the time being caught because of serious injury Ruadedh Knott, she was thrown out with a stick, when from then on Ayar with a power forward by Stafford McDowall, fitted by Clili.
The Ayr captain is then given a drink card, and, Melrose is too high with Bruce Colvine's Try, at the end of power.
Our family returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow flash after crossing Cli without a ball, except for the pencil line, MacPerson touched an Ayar.
Climi entered, as you did at the beginning, after Kyle Rowe meets with David Armstrong's ball that sends the David Armstrong on the fifth side of the home.

‘ Sea is ours: Bolivian officials hope that the court will open the Pacific road
Watchers at the ringing-clad headquarters and the L Paz ship's crew.
The interior structures raise the flag ore-blue.
Naval is from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon with this title: "The sea is my right.
Recovery is our job.
In all parts of Bolivia, memories of coasline disappeared in Chile in the 19th century are still clear – as you look forward to going to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes are perhaps based on your age, Bolivia is waiting to be ruled by an international court for repairs on 1 Saturday, five years later.
" Bolivia has Power, a spirit of unity and humility, and is, in fact, waiting for a passage," says Roberto Calzadilla, who speaks for Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch the CJ ruling on large screens everywhere, with great hope that the Hague court will reap Bolivia's cry that – after the talks that extended years – Chile is forced to negotiate with one another by giving Bolivia control over the part of the sea.
Evo Morales, a suitable president of Bolivia – facing long competition with choice and next year-- has much to do with Monday.
"We are too close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," vowing toward the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is less likely to reap Bolivia’s harvest — and that name will change if it agrees.
The Netherlands supports the UN body that has the power to commend the Chilean areas, affirming that it can never be determined by the results of the talks.
That the ICJ rulings came only six months after the debate was heard that the subject was "not difficult," says the international policy observer of Chile, Paz Zárate.
Not far from being fulfilled in Bolivia's purposes, the past four years may have brought them back.
"The question of allowing sea use is adopted by the Bolivian authorities," says Zarate.
Morales ’ aggressive speech hinders the integration of Chile's cooperation, so he put it.
Bolivia and Chile will for some time continue their discussions, but it will be very difficult to continue reasoning after this.
Two countries have not changed with delegates since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in Hague, has cleared the charges that the court is too quick to make a decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new period of relationship with Chile" and the opportunity "to set a 139 years of agreement on the benefits of both countries", and so.
Clazidilla and you will deny that Meorals – is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used sea issue as a basis for politics.
" Bolivia will never abandon its branch of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is an opportunity for it to appear that we need a past victory."
North Korea says that the surrender to nuclear weapons will not happen unless they are able to trust the American.
Foreign minister Ri Yong Ho of North Korea says that his country will not stop armed with nuclear weapons without having confidence in Washington.
I was talking about Saturdays at a conference of United Nations.
She appealed to America to follow her promises at the Singapore conference among rival leaders.
His observations until the time of America. Country secretary Mike Pompeii looks at the first unsolved nuclear issue three months after Singapore and Kim Jon Un of North Korea.
It is an unrealistic dream that a continuing drug and a U.S. shortage of a U.S. peace treaty in Korea has caused North Korea to fall.
Washington is aware that he does not agree to make Pyongang announcements before he begins to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S. / American President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
However, there is a growing trend in Pyonging’s willingness to give up weapons that the world may view as the only safe way to escape.
Pompeii plans to visit Pyongdang the next month to prepare for the second conference of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows a lot of wear in the head that comes to the closets of nearby clothes
If you want to increase the list of your hats or you just block out the sun altogether, don’t look away.
The painter Valentino and Thom Browne have produced a list of large head hats in their S19 hole in the Paris Facion Week presentation.
Unbelievable hats are filled in Instagram this summer, and the weavers bring eye - catching exhibits.
The highlights of Valentino have been a long hat on the sides of a dust that has feathers and a tip over the head of the model.
Some of the larger sizes include jewelry, a hat of witches.
Thom Browne has produced rare face masks in the time of Halloween.
Most masks close to the mouth look like Hannibal Lectter rather than the material made by the top - model designers.
Another structure that is similar to underwater life jackets has breathing and harbours.
If you persist in a fad or fashion, you can put yourself in harm’s way.
The fashion world suspects that large hats may be on the way to large rows of clothing stores.
A large hat is soon followed by I ‘ La Bomba', a two-foot hat that can open the sunlight, which is seen in Rihanna's "everyone" to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of an unreliable hat that is popular on the communications pages sent some goods to the exhibit-a life bag about the same as the swimmer was shown.
A red - orange bag made of a raffia tree was finished, dressed in white skin in the hold, taking it alone to the Jacques exhibition La Riviera SS19 on a fashion show in Paris.
The popular wearer Luke Armamitage tells FEMAIL 'I expect to see large hats and sea bags arrive at the major shopping malls in this coming version-assisters have had a great impact on them will be difficult to realize the need to do more things as a couple.'
John Edward: Muslim skill is important to the inhabitants of the continent.
The private schools in Scotland keep details of good results, and this has continued in the year 2018 with other good results, guaranteed only by the success of individual and fellow sports, art, music, and other social efforts.
With a consuming number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are placing their focus on providing the best help.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education, as well as in the field they choose as citizens in the country.
As an educational department that can organize and start a special educational program, we see modern fields continue to be famous and popular as a school curriculum.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man about a spirit he hears, what you say straight to his head."
If you talk to him about his nose, what you are saying will come to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we will not always rely on the English if we want to establish cooperation and trust with foreigners.
From the results of this year’s tests, we can see that the most important chemicals in the club are achieved most in private schools.
There were sixty-eight of all the students who had learned the outer fields, and received the High Class A.
The symptoms, gathered from 70 and four schools of SCIS, indicate that seventy percent of the students received High Class A from Mandarin, since 70 percent of the other German - speaking students, sixty-9 percent of those who were French other than sixty-three percent who also learned Spanish A.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as important skills for children, and young people inevitably will need them in the future.
It stands now as a choice in which to choose a study, being considered the same as the courses (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in schools that are independent of the curriculum and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Eplomymeny and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons why employers are unable to close up to 17 percent (17 per cent) are made by a lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, in particular, the ability to speak in a language is of great importance in preparing youths for employment opportunities.
With the many expected tasks that I am learning, these skills are vital in a united world.
No matter what field a person takes, if they read the second nose, they put themselves in a better position in the future to develop this skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign lands puts one in line for another.
According to a UK survey of more than 4000 adults (4,000) of the UK in 2013, 7 and 5 per cent were unable to speak foreign language well and to communicate well and French is the only one 1 percent raised by a population of two, fifteen percent (15 percent).
There can be no end to the practice of agriculture that is important for today’s children.
Having more crops you know, especially those of developing lands, will help to deprive children of better opportunities for a better job.
In Scotland, school and school differs from one language to another.
Many of the schools focus on teaching old and modern fields, and some teach vegetables that are considered more important in the UK in terms of the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes you, there are many types of dew that you can choose from private schools, feeding inexperienced ones in the area.
Scotland’s private schools are committed to provide educational structure for the children and to give children the skills they need to succeed, the future holds.
In the present era, there can be no doubt that agriculture will continue to play an important role in the future of the world, so I must be made up of education.
In fact, the modern field must be included in the "international communications skills."
The private schools will continue to offer this opportunity, variety, and ingenuity to the young Scots.
You have to do the right thing.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

The Ruder 2018rd band in America is confident to fight in keeping up with the prospects of one - day sports a Sunday.
After a three - side meeting, on Saturday afternoon, the Ruder Cup games may have been four times as often as possible.
A full - fledged weapon is a game program that has been started but the players believe in it, not in comparison.
Where, then, will they say that they are stronger now?
"They lead in six points and are now four, so we continue as if by less force I think" says Jordan Spieth as they drive slowly on the day.
Europe has opportunities, indeed, four points ahead of twenty.
Americans, as Spieth puts it, have little fun and much to be encouraged, not by the way of the Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day long and each has three points.
Spieth has been dangerous and has been taking the lead by example.
Those who watched were thrilled when he became, the patient beating of a golf course is vital to the balance of the game when Thomas himself separated by twos.
His golf course won the game by the same 15 pleasure, this type tells you that you believe the American group has not yet gone out.
"Surely you will have to dig deeper and worry about your game," says Spiegel.
One of these players is now left.
There are 18 holes to mark them.
The only player with more grades than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are those of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, asked by the Ever Cup.
Europe's contents but the struggle which makes them very tender and determined.
"Moliwood" are the only mats who won't start the begey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoid bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
This race, as it were, comes from this noisy crowd who conclude that they are the winners on Sunday, and there will no longer be famous players who will be eager to win Europe as the sun sets this Gulf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
The two mines are all alike
The well - known expression in Europe has not changed, yet it does.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson perform little work for Sergio Garcia, the morning fobballs, when Alex Noren was arrested.
Bogey, the first doubles leave a long gap in Spain and Swede not to catch them.
On Sundays, no one will help you get out of your pit.
Fourbals and dustsomes enjoy watching closely because of cooperation between fathers, counsel given, firm counsel, and the way a clever strategy can change quickly.
Europe has enjoyed good growth as a group and led to the end but the dustsomes have shown that the USA still has the power to continue, by choice, in the United States.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ruder Cup.
Europe will be on the best on the last day of the Ruder Cup after going out from the dustbals and folders on Saturday by 10-6 leading to the United States.
duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won twice as much as to pull the Tiger Woods out of four points from the Golf National.
On the European side Thomas Bjorn, is determined to break the cup that they lost in Hazel two years ago, the failure of America on the second follalls, and a 31 series.
The U.S. has set up a difficult and heavy dust for the dust, to win two games, but it will not just wear a bear.
Jim Furryk, on the other hand, needs nine points on the 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to find out the details in order of the time when he himself, Molinari, named her "Molliwood" after a beautiful weekend, did not provide four points in their four freeways of the Ruder Cup's history.
By separating Woods and Patrick Reed from the dustbulls, they then took up the belt Woods and the American Bryson Dechhambeau in 5&4.
Woods, has entered two Saturday games, expressed great determination, but she now loses 19 of 29 fields and a rowsomes.
Justin Rose, sitting on the morning fanbuls, returned to a ta Henrik Stenson on the fo'c's in 2.1 to divide Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – 3th class around the world.
And they are determined to return to power in any way they can get it, only to look at cruelty, pollution.
The Jordan Spieth and Justini are three times beaten across the Americans by three points on Saturday.
They gained 2 wobulter and the Spanish Ian Poulter in foulls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy at 4&3 at the fo'c'ss while crossing two open holes.
In the case of Rylader Cup only twice to have a team from four points to single games, the Furyk on the other side requires only measuring to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, the Sunday attack seems to be overcoming them.
North Korea says that it will ‘ not be armed out, it is not trusted.
The foreign minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the United Nations continues to magnify infidelity and that it is impossible for the world to release nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
R Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had made a "reconception" last year, such as nuclear deterrence and nuclear testing, nuclear disarmament, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "No matter what, we don't see an answer from the U.S."
"Unbelieved in the U.S. will have no hope for the security of the world, and under this situation there is no way for us to be self-constituted first."
While it is not in agreement with North Korea's research on Washington's rejection of the nuclear end while North Korea may be rewarded with taking steps, the statement is that it does not prevent the total nuclear extinction as Pyongang did in the past.
Ri refers to the statement established by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump first met between the president U.S. and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, where Kim asked to work in the "destruction of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised the protection of North Korea.
North Korea has been trying to bring an end to the war of Korea in 1950-53, but the United States ordered Pyongang to release nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists on "the first-rate ending" and raises the measures of the law to achieve its aim by force, and also refuses the "war" proclamation.
"Recognizing that the law can humble us what is a fantasy of people who don't care about us.
But the problem is that persistence fosters feelings of insecurity.
Ri has not disclosed plans for reunification between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader has declared it to the United Nations from rivals.
The minister presented at least three seminars between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If half of the case of the nuclear genocide is in South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear genocide of Korean penicillin will not cause this commitment."
Even so, it is said, the sound of Ri's speech was totally different from that of the previous year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that looks at the U.S. key place and North Korea's crossets that occurred after "Mu. As the evil Judge Trump called Kim "rocket man" in this case.
This year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened the "exasperation of North Korea, raised Kim’s courage not to take up armed action, but there is still much to be done and the law remains until North Korea eliminates the nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump says he has no time for all this, "If it lasts two, three, or five years" there's no problem.
China and Russia argued as the U.N. Security Council to win the Pyongang for the steps taken.
Even so, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: Security Council on Thursday: "The forcing of the Security Council must continue with force and will not fail until we see the conclusion, complete, and evidence of the nuclear destruction."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in breaking law since 2006 in establishing nuclear payments and Pyonging strategy.
Pompeii met Ri with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we would visit Pyonggang next month to prepare for a second time.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been smooth.
He left Pyongyang in July which advanced progress was made, of North Korea alone by making a public display of the "tribution" as a criminal.
North Korea arranges a meeting with Moon for this month to complete the radiation position and nuclear mixture when the United States takes the "one action."
Kim said that she told me of the ‘ similar steps" she wanted to strengthen safety when Trump promised in Singapore and caused the general social status of Washington.
Harvard heady students help them get enough sleep
Course was new at Harvard University this year for all the young graduates to go to bed so that they can overcome the habit of taking on caffeine “all night. ”
The educational system has found many students in high - school institutions that they are useless when it comes to basics that they can take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and an expert in Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course, the first of this type of U.S.
She was encouraged to start a course after giving a talk on how sleep takes me to read.
At the end of her came a girl to me, saying, 'Why did this be told me now, in my middle year?'
He said that no one had told him of a strange – sleeping condition, and told the Telegram.
Course was first published this year, explaining to students the value of sleep habits as well as the benefits of regular exercise and exercise.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's educational system, said that the university has decided to die during the week that most students do not sleep at all.
The length of the study involves a series of steps being taken.
The first part is the picture of the school room, where students select caffe, caffeinies, trainers, and books about the effects of caffeine and the light of exercise helps sleep, and sleep.
On the other hand, half are told that prolonged sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, stroke, and cancer.
A compass map, with useful signs, will then encourage those who share in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
‘ We know that he will not change the behavior of the disciples' immediately.
We believe they have a right to know — just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke, ’ adds Professor Czeisler.
The tradition of boasting in ‘ community until ’ is a practice, saying, which adds that modern technology and excessive pressure to students reduces sleep patterns that are becoming more and more serious.
To ensure sufficient, sufficient sleep, it must be the student's ‘ secret weapon ’ to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means to avoid obesity, since lack of sleep puts the mind into the condition of hunger, causing them to be hungry.
Raymond Shuti, a 19 - year - old student in California who is studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the study, once in one of his classes a year during his first year in Harvard.
She said that the study opened her eyes and urged her to study the study and be at the center.
The next step, of hope, is to ask the high - school students to learn the same way before they join this supercolliant center.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students think of catching them when they go to bed, however, that they will wake up, and understand the dark side of ‘ blue light of the sky ’ which is produced by the electric screens and the LED light, which can remove them from the orbit, which leads to the angle.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranges: Menga article lowers Gerard’s men
Ringers were organized by a medium and went away during the siege of Dolly Menga who attacked Steven Gerrard’s unremitting charge and broke it to the ground and failed 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox has long intended to record their first victory since they won February 41 on St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team is responsible for the second conquest of Gerard on 18 games as an administrator who has left his side on eight notes to the Ladbrokes Premiershipshets.
Inganga has attacked you for seven minutes before heff-time and the Ringers' players are enduring without any resistance to the fighting.
When Ringers now descended to the sixth, Livingstone jumps to the third position and behind Hebernian apart.
And there may be a problem coming to Ringers after a rowman Clum Spence was tested for first aid after an accident caused by a remote turn.
Gerard has changed eight times in the past Ayr to Betfried Cup of GConfs.
Holt, on the other hand, took 11 of the same Book 11 out of Hearts a week ago and could not rejoice in the way your well - worn clothes kept the rivals on all sides.
Ringers may have held the ball extensively, but Livingston has done much with the ball he found.
They would have failed within two minutes when Menga’s sleeping sent Scott Pittman to an article in Allan McGregor but a prosthetic player who lost a large chance of riding a ball.
Keh superior Jacobs have obtained Craig Halkettoi-cupper but his partner, Alan Lithlow, cut it off from the background.
Ringers managed to control but were more confident than to believe in their game in the last third stage of the game.
Alfred Morelos had felt that he should have obtained a mere pencil for us when he was fighting with Steve Lawles but with a secretary Steven Thomson had dismissed the Colombian request.
Ringers are able to insert two articles in the first half directly facing the pole but the oldest Ibrox sticker Liam Kelly is not concerned about the bullet inserted by Lassana Coububaly and the reduced attack of Ovie Ejaria.
When Lisa opened the opening of her 34th leg, it may not have been in the form of a game, no one would deny that she was fit for her activity.
The Ringers again failed to cope with Jacobs ’ soccer stick.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher taunted Scott Robinson, who had us coolly thrown Menga away to finish easily.
Gerardube took a walk after vacation when she changed Coubally on Ryan Kent, and the change almost gave way to a sudden turn of events when the captain jumped off Morelos but Kelly, who is impressed with the movement from his line to block it.
But Livingstone goes on to describe the spectators by playing their own game, and Lithgow and Halket squealing ball behind other long - distance parades.
The Holt's side could open a gap in the last stages, but McGregor stopped Jacobs before Lithgow hit a ball in the corner.
Ringers Glann Middleton finds a stick stick as long as he has a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson is also on the opposite side.
Almanac: Geiger Counter receptor
And now our page " Sunday Morning" Almanac: Hope 30, 1882, the 136 years ago, and UVA ... the day when the next physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of identifying and measuring the radio content, which led to the development of the fame that eventually came to be known as the Geiger Counter.
The nucleus of science since then, the Geiger Counter that became the nucleus of the pop cave, such as in the 1950 “Bells of Coronado, ” to which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, is used to find radar active minerals, such as uranium.
While you insert open anchorphones, you may be able to hear the atoms released by the radioactivity by minerals.
Evans: "We, it's going out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, 63 days in the meantime.
But this original name bears his name for all eternity.
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ identify ’ wrong cells
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ identify ’ wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the immune system to ‘ identify ’ wrong cells as a treatment program
The procedure involves taking the immune system cells from the patient, which are replaced by the web.
'Not seeing' normal protein in most cancers and then reactivated
The goal of color demonstrates the promising effect on cancer patients.
A woman treated with the goal of teaching the immune system to detect the wrong cells, saw the cervix vanishing at the end of 18 months.
This procedure involves taking protective cells from a patient, converted into a laboratory to "see" normal protein in a large number of cancers called heR2, and reactivated cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "prototypes of cancer," including breast, uterus, lung and other cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same way to take protective cells from patients is to teach them" how you understand cancer cells that have worked well in treating a particular form of kraemia.
The West once had the idea of establishing Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his appearance with a cup of beer.
It’s not going well
Once West was hailed for the Saturday Light Live after singing praises to American President Donald Trump and said that he would join the election by 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called the Ghost Town when wearing a cap inscribed Tike America Great, he began to sound with Democrats and confirmed the establishing of Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and say, "How can you love Trump, you are prejudiced?"
If I had been concerned about prejudice I would have been away from America long ago, he said.
SNL started the program with Matt Damon's chapter when a Hollywood official ridiculed the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Special Committee on cases of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not to be spread, the West sound chapter was put in chat rooms by the humorist Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to ridicule West by writing it.
Also, West complained to onlookers that they were treating him severely at the rear of the stage and put it on my head.
"They hit me behind the platform.
They said, ‘ Don't have that helmet there.'
They beat me!
They also said that I was going to a place of refuge," saying, according to the Ministry of Washington.
The West went on and said: "Do you want to see a place in the holes?" saying "Can you wear his superman cap, because it means that you won't tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try love.
Not long ago they were twice seen by the SNL screeners and the shy SNL team, while Variety reported, one telling the printers: "The silence of the radio was quiet."
West was fitted with the pledge of the singer Ariana Grande after the time, his old boyfriend, Rapper Mark Miller has died a few days ago.
Many of the West's writings are about the singing of I Lovet, as a Perrier Bottle.
West is the victim of the former TUPSA, Candace Turner who put it on to the tsettter, said: "There is a strangely strong wind: WE ARE A DEPRESSED AND A EXPLORER.."
But the director of a chat program Karen Hunter wrote to twetter that the West "is a man sitting and that's good."
"But I chose not to hire anyone (by buying his music or clothing or establishing his "art") which I believe is present and full of dangerous ideas in society.
You are free.
So we are," he adds.
Before the exhibition, rapper was afraid to have changed his name, saying that he is now going to be called "by the old name Kane West."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as auff Dadddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The jupper, Snup Dogg’s partner was once called SNup Lion and, indeed, the pre-competent singer Prince, changed his name by sign and was named Prince.

The explosion occurs after Kavanaugh was introduced to three satellite questions.
Old Web sites such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedSTate reported that the IP address points to it and that the Waters Office is the one that has produced the data of Waters' activity, reports Hill.
"These uncertainties are false and false," continues Waters.
"The integrity of my employees – the ownership, the personal data, and the safety of the victims as a result of fraud and lying – did not involve the explosion of the details.
These false charges are absolutely false and not true.
Waters statement soon became a criticism on the Internet, including the former secretary of the White House Express Ari Fleischer.
"Deep rather than tired," writes Fleischer.
"This means that he is not mild enough to call the Pre-Change.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not give up.
They must not give in.
They should not accuse the accused’s motives.
They must be quiet and at peace.
Fleischer is comparing Waters' answer to criticism by the Democrat Justice Kavanaugh, who was criticized by the critics who were too tired at the time of trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a member of the Republic who is going to enter Waters's shoes in the middle-time selection, with him in his opinion to Twutter.
"Great if true," he writes to Towtter.
In his statement, Waters told his office to inform the "Court officials and the judiciary on these charges of fraud.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," continues, "and they will be held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts anywhere or all my employees."
The vision of Johnny English Strikes Again - lowers the strength of Rowan Atkinson’s Pypoof
It is now customary to consider Brexit's importance in any British film and is not even seen in the promotion of the Johnny English game that began in 2003 with Johnny English and its replacement in 2011 The Johnny English Rebborn.
Eating hot potatoes as mentioned in the article could have a new opportunity to sell outside?
At any rate, the open - eyed face of Johnny English who had the right to promote new things for the second time — that name is a big joke designed by the non - English movie theater.
It is indeed a minute of the unpretentious checker that out of even his unusual pretense to the flashing glory produces Clousauau, Mr Bean's drier and his influence from the Chariots of Fire comeme in the opening of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also drawn from the identityist and secretman Atkinson who passes through the latest commercials of the Barclaycard TV, who has left the turmoil at his wake.
There are other times and two of this current visit in J.
I like Johnny English to get on the helicopter and have a long suit of soldiers and small swords hanging on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift is a fair display, but humor seems to be too low and too elaborate, especially in the production of "solid" films such as 007 and the Mission Impossible itself which now present humor as a substance.
Laments about us are more than adults, and to me Johnny English’s journey is smooth and smooth and hard and is not based on Atkinson’s silent film that is accompanied by Bean’s sounds and personality.
The story now is that Great Britain is in a big bank.
The cyber-hacker entry into the secret task of the British explorers, reveals the data of Britain's majors in the field, which is concerned with a job - less work to Kevin Eldon.
The last minute of the full-time printer is hot, faced with a failure in the political community: Emma Thompson is trying hard to imitate Teresa-May but has nothing to do with the text.
His spies inform him that all the spies are to be reformed, that they must follow the man on their way.
This means that Johnny English is himself, now like a shoolmaster in an expensive, but provides some introduction lessons about the identity of the explorer: these jokes, since English offers the obscenities in Rock-type cardemmy.
Englishud in Whitehal to be given urgent orders and to be reunited with her partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, joined by submarine commander, a pleasant place to play by Vicki Pepperine.
So Batman and Robin, the Secret Minister of the Queen has returned, meets Olga Kurylenko's being autil system of death Ophelia Bulletinova.
There, the prime minister is fast preying on the culture of millions who say he can solve computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, which Jake Lacy played.
English and Bough began a strange journey: hiding like a net, starting a fire at a restaurant in France; they began the problem of selling themselves in the Volta luxury boat; and English that took away the puzzle while learning to use the Virtual Reality headset to adapt to the Volt house.
All efforts are made to improve the last chapter or to have a friendship and force, rather than the children’s TV on everything.
He has never given up on them.
And as with other films of Johnny English I could not restrain myself: Britain’s movie world was unable to give Rowan Atkinson a beautiful seven - story restaurant?
Labour denies that they proposed that Britons work for four days but to be paid for five days
The Sammy Coryn team of the Laborer is thinking of an amazing scheme to see Britons working four victims – but paid five.
The team reports that they want company executives to pass on the profit generated by ARC Intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them more time.
Workers appear to be having fun for three days of the weekend — but pay the same amount.
The sources say that this view can fit the economic aim of the group as well as the program to convert the nation into the labor force.
The four - day transition is authorized by the Trades Union Congress as a way to take the opportunity to change the economy.
The well of Your Party tells The Sunday Times: ‘ The diagnosis of a pill is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'It won't happen by night but by four days in the church but working four days is a reflection of the economic system of the reindeeration to harvest workers and the whole concept of the field.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to recommend the plan, and the Green Party that binds the four working days during the 2017 gene operation.
The intention had not yet been established by the entire Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A four - day job is not an organization’s cure and is not considered by the group at all.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous Labour church conference to express his view of capitalism in the economy.
Mnn McDonnell said he was willing to absorb and the power is also ‘ the unknown guides ’ and ‘ the winners ’ in the plant firms.
And the shaft chancellor also explains that dosholders in water companies may not get the whole party as did Labour government to ‘ pull ’ in the wrong ways.
She also made sure to include personnel in company boards and on the Inclualve Owenership Funds to give 10 percent of the pravate-serial screens to the staff, who will be leaked for a year the profit limited to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy observed "60 Minutes" that the FBI research about Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The FBI investigation by judge Brett Kavanaugh reduced the time of election for the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the detectives's findings can change how nebulators in Repubblica attract followers.
In a Sunday discussion, the "60 Minutes" head of conversations Scott Pelley has asked the Republics Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they can find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more relaxed than his South Carolina peers.
"I tell, of course," says Kennedy.
"When I went aside to the side, I also spoke to Kavanaugh, the judge.
I called her after this, and those excuses went out, and I said, 'Have you done this?'
He was stubborn, turned around, and didn't care.
Graham’s jaw, though, seems to have been cut.
"I've decided with Brett Kavanaugh and will take firm criticism," he said.
"Dt. Ford, I know what has happened, but I know this: Brett has immediately refused," adds Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not all partakers are sure of that.
It has been 36 years.
I see nothing changing.
What did the Global Citizen Festival and Have tried to Reduce Poverty?
In this Saturday New York will handle the Global Citizen Festival, a annual event with a list of active and well - planned players; to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have a human locust swarming into a large stadium in Central Park not only to please Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but to stay active with the real goal of getting rid of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project, an international organization that strives to eliminate poverty by increasing its fighting population.
To get a ticket for a party (except that you want to pay for VIP ticket ticket), the tourees had to do something "actions" such as volunteers, sending e-mail to the world leader, calling or doing something more intense to help you concentrate on getting out of bed.
How successful has the Global Citizen been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of benefiting people with free social entertainment just a means to try people to do something, or is something else called "clictivism" – people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on a computer screen or sending a ticket?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has built up the "actions" of their more than 19 million adherents, and the treatment of different purposes has been accomplished.
It says that these actions have helped to reduce the world’s lowerers to a minimum of self - interest and goals over $37 billion that will affect the health of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Beginning in 2018, the group has collected 390 suggestions and notices from their actions, about $10 billion spent a day or tried to collect them.
The team estimates that the income has directly affected 649 million people worldwide.
Other commitments include The Power of Nutrition, U.S. co-nutributers and founders who are dedicated to "helping children properly," promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eradicate hunger in the country after obtaining the 4700 steets in the Global Cities.
"With the establishment of the UN government, donors, state governments, and the Global Citizens like you, we can try to make a record of malnutrition due to the lack of social improvement," the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman has caught the crowd up in a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that over 5,000 years ago to call the U.K. have improved nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced the program's support, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children by taking advantage of nutrition.
In reply to some of their FAQs on their Web site asking "What do you think we can do to eliminate severe poverty?"
The Global Catizen answered: "It will be a long and heavy way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as public rights and anti-partheid protests before us, we will overcome, because we are very powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekd, the Shawn Menes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, some of those who contributed to this event in New York, which was celebrated by Deborra-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The US may well have used the "Declaration" to prevent the transfer of a Russian Enterigy - Interor Secretary
Washington "if necessary" ships to prevent Russian 5, including the Middle East, the Internal Secretry Ryan All revealed it, by the Washington Examiner.
All of them have said that Russian and Syria discussions, when working with the government’s signatures – is a means to try some new nergy markets.
"I believe in why the Middle East wants to find an innergy as it was in Eastern Europe, and in the middle of Europe, reports.
And, in harmony with the employee, there are ways to repair it.
"The United States knows, for our army, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, shut down, to ensure that their power is not gone to market," he says.
He was speaking to those present at the conference sponsored by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "power - user's voice" in the US.
He also compared the Washington efforts to deal with Russia and Iran, saying that the results are the same.
" Choosing to trade with Iran and Russia, to some extent, is a means of obtaining and obtaining oil," he said, when he spoke of Russia saying that it is a ‘ steed horse" and has a economy that is dependent on oil spills.
These statements appear as the Trump office put forth efforts to promote the export of their natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a more expensive method for European buyers.
As a result, officials of Trump’s office, including the US president Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipe project "unnecessary", according to Trump, which has turned Berlin into "low" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipes are $111 billion, which is designed to double the present range of pipes to be over 100 feet [1010 m], indeed an economic project.
The Kremlin notes that persistent opposition to the Washington project is due to economic reasons and is an example of the unrighteous competition.
"I believe we have the same idea that the power can be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose whom to buy," says Russian Powerful Officer Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with the US Rick Perry Secretary in Moscow in September.
The position of the US caused Germany to retreat, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
A leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to resign from the EU's mighty goal and accords between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third world interferes with our supply of energy," says Dieter Kemf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent conference between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Waren "Viewably" Joining an election to Be President in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday to enter the election as president after a middle-time election.
During a meeting at the city hall in Hoguli, Massachusetts, Warren has made sure that he will consider the choice.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes the woman who will be the leader," says she, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm going to take a close look to joining the election to become president."

"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump did to my people," he said.
Warren had spoken out against Trump and his choice of High Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In what he wrote to the Tableter on Friday, Warren said "It's true that we need an FBI investigation before making a vote."
A report published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's followers do not think they should join the choice by 2020.
A 50 percent of the "probably" people of Massachusetts say that the satellite should not enter the selection, in accordance with the figures received by the Soffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe.
32% have supported it.
The figures showed further support for the fact that former Emperor Daval Patrick did not enter the choice, 38 percent said he did not fit it, and 48 percent said he did not.

Sarah Kunin speaks of TTSD of Tack Winin at a Donald Trump meeting
Tack Kunun, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the army in Sept.
She was arrested and accused of family violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he has experienced after returning, I can see how other families are coping with the traumatic effects of PTSD and other injuries our returning soldiers," telling the audience at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18 states, D.C. supports the work of a new safety project
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support a new legal effort to have a new U.S. new goal that prohibits the protection of people fleeing from criminal or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and district countries sent a statement to the witnesses on Friday in Washington to support a person needing protection against this goal, reports NBC News.
The full name of the defendants in Grace v. Assos which the American Civil Liberies Union has inserted in August against the state's goal has not yet been revealed.
He was tortured by his partners and his ‘ violent sons, ’ but the U.S. officials would not accept his request for protection on July 20.
She has been settled in Texas.
The supporters of Grace defined El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of people with U.S. security applications, as countries facing major problems with traffic and domestic violence.
A new U.S. new U.S. policy of protection turns to the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed non-said residents to escape domestic violence to find protection.
The Columbia Council's Attorney General said in its statement on Friday a new goal is "not to pay attention to the law of the state, and of the world."
"The law says that all appeals for protection must be judged on the facts of each case, and making a decision like this is breaking that law," says a witness called by the court.
The lawyers also pointed out that the goal that prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. economy is a threat to the economy, claiming that they may be business and "will create jobs."
The Attrney General Jeff Sessions advised arrive judges to no longer protect people from domestic violence and criminal violence in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or terror because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a certain group or political opinion," says Sesions in his declaration on June 11.
Protection was not intended to eliminate all problems -- and even all the major problems faced by people around the world every day.
Greater efforts are being made in Palu as the number of deaths is repeated in efforts to locate survivors
For those who survive, the condition is a deep one.
"It's very serious," says 35-year-old Rsa Kusuma, comforting her son at a center of those who have survived in the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings dead bodies.
We have no clean water.
The villagers seem to return to their ruined homes, search their property in abundance, and try to find anything they can find.
Hundreds of people are also injured in hospitals, which have been devastated by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude, were filled with death.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, were sitting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of an ongoing quake.
Tears well up in his eyes as he recalls the scene in the fifth - floor hotel where his wife and daughter were living.
"There was no time to seek a way out.
I have been depressed in the broken walls, I think," Haris has told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city of marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and it was so quiet.
I don't know what has happened to her and to my child.
I hope they are alive."
A U.S. ambassador accuses China 'on false advertising'
A week later the official Chinese newspaper has a four - page U.S. commercial advertising that is in the interests of both U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing by using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of the donated property of China Daily at Des Moines Register - Iowa newspaper - after racking China for an election of No. 6 in the U.S.
The Trump charge that Beijing was trying to interfere with U.S. votes created what U.S. officials said to Routers was a new class in Washington’s campaign of oppression of China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to do business, Beijing and Washington are now caught up in a war of increasing trade that created to have endless profits when sending goods to one another.
The funds that China wanted at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to mistreat delegates to such places as Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party, say researchers of China and the U.S.
Terry Brustad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who sent most of the agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Branstad on the Sunday issue Des Moines Register, "It's twice the harassment by making false ads in our free newspaper."
"In the province that has been distributed, the Chinese government has made it available in the American tradition of freedom of speech and free newspaper by placing an award on Des Moines Register," writes Brantad.
"On the contrary, at the street market here in Beijing, there are few different views you will find and you will not see the true reaction of the varied views that the Chinese may have about the effects of the Chinese economic problem, if it is thought that the media are viewing with the Chinese Communist Party, you write.
He has added that "one of China's leading newspapers has escaped the opportunity to print" his story, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
The Republicans Kill Women’s Choices Before the Middle Ages because of the Kavanaugh Fall, Warning the Critics
Since many Republicans are waiting for and protecting the potential to be admitted to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for a number of charges against abuse, the analysts have warned that the wood will return with the mugger, especially for the mother, during the middle election of the next season.
High lungs in this regard, and many Republicans are already expressing that they wanted to move ahead with the choice.
Those things will no longer be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill in a Saturday article.
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s final efforts to make an inquiry will suffice to make angry votes lower the lungs.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - will not be forgotten tomorrow and November," says Karen Jean-Pierre, a red - hot counselor and international spokesman for the growing Moveon group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the rioters shouted, "Come November!" as they rioted in the Senate auditorium as the Republicans controlled the Judician Committee choosing to continue and select Kavanaugh despite the evidence sent by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Deocrats and incentives will end," says Stu Rotheberg, a neutral political analyst, telling the media.
"People say it’s already hot; it’s true.
But it may still be much higher, especially among the voters of women in the cities and young voters, aged 18-9, that although they don't like the president, they rarely vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony with details of his charges against the possibility of being brought before the Supreme Court, researchers say that the wood could return with the arson if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has been the damage to theGOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the previous week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or final vote or that Kavanaugh is put on the platform, about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they dealt with him," says Guy Cecil, director of the Prolitics USA, a group helping people to choose Democrats, informing the media.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided by whom to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and are inclined to break Kavanaugh.
New figures from You Gov show that 41 percent of the people are certainly or somewhat not to believe the Ford evidence, while 35 percent say they are sure or to some extent believe Kavanaughism.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was definitely or to some extent lied to the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI now examines cases brought by Ford and at least one defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford said before the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had abused her alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that a defendant in the High Court showed her private parts during the course of your study in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
World Wide Web Editor Preparing to Start New Network Conflicting Network
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, starts a program that conflicts with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
A new technology project, the Inrupt, is a company built at the open source of the Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their database will be stored and the information people are allowed to achieve.
In a unique conversation with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the goal of Inrupt is "to strike the earth."
"We must do it now," so says the task.
"It's a history."
This plugin uses Solid technology to allow people to create a "Personal error online" or POD.
It can also include lists of people, to do, a calendar, a music library, and other electronic devices.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify all are found in one brush and at the same time.
What is significant about the POD store is that it depends on whom user can get the data type.
The company calls it "a net which gives you power."
An Inrupt idea, in line with the CEO of the company, is that the company brings in the kidneys, protein and skills necessary to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a defenses platform purchased by IBM, volunteer workers with contract applications, and many volunteer licenses.
From this report, the founders of technology around the world may develop their accolades using tools available to the Inruptle of Infuge.
Berners-Lee said that she and her group speak with "Faopok and Google" whether it should or should be brought about a complete change in which their entire business will change completely.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In another column in the Saturday Mediterranean printed on Saturday, Berners- Lee wrote that Inrupt "will provide the power of trade and operating system that will help to protect integrity and a new library built on Solid.."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded World Wide WebConsortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has taken the lead in the debate on neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is published, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and Director of the World Wide WebConsortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to the start of this future period of the web," adds Berners- Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commended by a pastor who has received a Victoria Cross for WW1
The only minister of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during World War I has been praised in his city after 100 years.
Lt Col Minister Bernard Vann won a prize in 29 September 1918 on an attack in Bellingse and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not realize that he had won the largest prize in the British army.
A memorial is opened with two of his grandchildren at a time in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "good sign" that the stone was opened in a hundred years right since his grandfather won a prize.
According to London Gazette, in 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his force across the Canal de Saint-Qentin's "on a mound of artillery and guns."
Later she rushed to the shooting area and led ahead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, aged 72, says that his grandfather's actions are ‘ something I don't know I could do but something to respect him."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put the flowers behind a leaf, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "the nation has a great right to participate in the clock" and said that "the real leader's hero is shown by the support which many people will give."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they received Peppa Pig
Just imagine, you stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 and be forbidden to watch a party.
This San Jose event consisted of 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown all night on the UK at Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, the UK viewers were left stunned when the station turned to Peppa Pig.
Others were not pleased to wait all night long until a special moment — particularly during the heat of the day.
One candidate in Twutter has defined this transition to children's animation as "unexpected laughter."
"It's a government policy that by 6 a.m. the contest was inappropriate and that it had to be changed to the order of the children," says Dave Schwartz, president of the Bellator of the trade and communication, when asked about this change.
"Appop the pig," yes."
The president of the Bellator company Scott Coker said they would take a close look at their cheeses in order to meet the UK spectators in the future.
"I think that if I think about playing it again, I think we might try to play it," says Cooker.
‘ But it is the sixth hour on Sunday there and we can’t fix it until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But we do.
I tell you, during the change, there is a lot of e - mail and all of it is not very appealing.
Trying to fix it, we thought it was a technological problem.
But not, it has been a matter of government.
I promise never again.
We will keep up - to - date with no more than six matches — as we used to do and try to please our adherents and have gone to extremes.
It was an unpleasant situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt ‘ outcasted ’ because of her sex
Olympic athlete Tom Dayley says that he has grown up isolated because of his sex - but that gives him the incentive to succeed.
The 24-year-old player said that he didn't realize it until he went to high school and said "Not everyone loves me."
Speaking of Radio 4 Desert Island Disscs first published by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals in order to give others the "hope."
He also said that if a parent makes him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The regular broadcast for the current program, Kirsten Young, has been inactive for months because she is sick.
Appeared as a person rejected in Laverne's first program, Daley said that she felt "relented" by everyone while growing up because it was "not acceptable for boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, a feeling of being different, have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he too was a ‘ man, ’ he said, so that he would not let everyone be disappointed when it turned out that he was a homosexual.
This winner who twice earned the Olympic medals became the person of the high LGAT and used his position at the Commyelth Games in Australia this year to persuade other countries not to view homosexuality as harmful.
He said that he has spoken because he feels privileged to be able to live a life free from problems and wants to give the ‘ hope to others. ’
The champion who won three - time international competition said that he was in love with the US movie producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013-203 – "Come to him."
Daley married and was awarded the Oscar prize, which he left for the past 20 years, but the age separation has never been a problem.
"When you experience so much in life at such a young age" - attends her first to the Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - says it is hard to find someone of his age who has had similar experiences.
These two adopted a child through June, the son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "view" has changed.
"If you would ask me a year ago, it's related to the 'I want to win a gold ring'," she said.
"You know what, there are things more important than the gold bracelets of the Olympic gold.
My gold bracelet of the Olympic gold is Robbie.
Her son has the same name as that of his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
She said that her father didn't accept her dying and that one of the last things she had asked if they had tickets to London 2012 - as she wanted to be.
"I couldn't say you won't be present in those games," she said.
"I would hold her by the hand when she had last breath and until she breathed her last breath and died there I realized that she was a person like us," she said.
The following year Daley joined the 2012 Olympic competition and received a copper medal.
"I suddenly realized that this was what I had been looking for all my life - — swimming in front of my people in the Olympic Games, he said," he said.
It also gave him the choice of his favorite song — Heather Small’s Program — which has kept his head on the brain during the preparation of the Olympics and is still motivating him.

Phil Mickelson of America will record the history of Sunday when he plays his 47 Master Cup game, but he will have to raise the socks to avoid the embarrassing background.
Mickelson, who will be playing on this event once in two 12 years, is seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furryk on the wards and on the Saturday seats.
Rather than taking the lead, as he often takes the lead in playing the United States, this fourth winner splits out twice as a promoter and worked on his game in hopes of finding out what is contributing to his downfall.
Since he is not a good soccer player even when he has time to play the game, this 48 - year - old player is not fit for the Le Golfin National game, where the main game is often a problem when you play a long - distance ball.
And if your game is not such a problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the nineth game a Sunday, you will face British Oppentri who is good at striking, who was also playing with the middle Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games in the week.
If these Americans, who lose four points in one of the 12 games, start the game well, Mickelson's game can be a final one.
Furryk has expressed his hope for his friends, and he has not said anything else.
"You fully understood the role she is having today, and she put me on my back with her arm and said she would be ready for tomorrow," said Furryk.
"You’re very confident about yourself.
You are a popular actor and have accomplished much in the past, as well as in the report.
Probably I didn’t think of him playing two games.
I had hoped for more, but that is what happened and that is what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone."
Mickelson will write a history past Nick Faldo on the number of games he has played with the Great Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game for the dyder Cup that has never been compared to what you’ve achieved as a player.
Mickelson has won 18 times, was eaten 20 times and played an equal number, although Furryk says that his presence has improved the group.
"It's good to be with him, you like to laugh, you like to make fun of people, and you are a good person in a group room," you have explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed being with him, and, in this report, it would be good to see you.
They do much more than play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that taking the lead in many points does not mean anything
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that taking the lead in so many points when going on the last day of a wave to the Reder Cup can easily change into a difficult game.
Dane played for the first time in 1997 in Valderrama, when a group with the Sever Ballestero took five points over the Americans but was finally at the top of one point, winning at 141 1⁄2-131.
"You always remind yourself that we were leading in many points in Valderrama; we led many points in Brookline, where we were eaten, and Valderrama, where we won, but in a few points," says Bjorn, who is in the picture, after watching the 2018 Class win at 5-3 on both Friday and May 6 in order to lead in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and the rest of the group that it has not yet come to an end.
Do your best next day.
Do that, and do everything in the right way.
It is not until you have reached the conclusions that you have reached.
It is our goal, our aim, and our attention.
I have always said this, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know that there are more than one of the world's largest players."
Thrilled with how his players have played at a difficult place, Bjorn has added: "I’ll never have this to do.
The next game is different.
The next day, each player will decide how he will play, and that is a different matter.
It is good to go out and play with someone when things are going well, but if you are alone, that is where you are fully tested as a golf course.
That is the message you have to pass to the players, that you do all you can to do tomorrow.
Now, he leaves the player behind and has to go and do all he can.
In contrast with Bjorn, her rival Jim Furryk will see that her players are better off playing alone than what has happened, except the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, three of the four points.
Furryk himself knows both eating and winning on the last minute, since he once became a part of the winning team in Brookline before his meal when Europe ‘ passed surprises in Medinah'.
"I remember very well," he says in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, urged his players to play on the last day.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it would be good to start with a top gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
As that motivation and energy go on, you put a heavy strain on those around you.
We organized our players in accordance with that and set our players in a way we thought would enable us to practice magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to try to take the lead in fighting and returning from the games and facing Rory McIlroy in the top sports, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter and others of Europe at the top level.
"I went along with this group because I thought it would be ready for the entire game," said Bjorn for the selected players.
A German warship is again being steered
A new type of German rubber Navy called Frigate was to begin operating in 2014 to replace old Col War-ara ships, but it will not exist until at least next year because of the system's system and the cost of snowball, reports local news.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz," head of the new ship Baden-Wuertteberg-clas reggate, is now reduced to the first part of 2019, says the Die Zeit newspaper quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the feast concerned a determined project's future.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class, alone by Navy as early as 2007, will take the position of Bremen-clas.
Understandably, ships will be equipped with powerful explosives, types of anti-submarine explosives and hidden devices, such as lack of space, inflame and sound.
Other important installations include long periods of care - not being able to use new ships for two years at a port.
However, the constant landing means that the important development of warships - will give Germany power - it is out of the way when it starts working, says Die Zeit.
A ship with the dead F125 appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blobmbnas station at Hamburg.
was the first time that the Navy had returned the ship from which it was built after being brought in.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship's being astern, but the German press has said that there is much important about the "soft and Hardware" which makes the warship useless when sent to war.
Software problems were particularly important since Baden-Werttemberg-class would be used by a crew of 120 — which is part of the older Bremen ship crew.
It also appeared that the ship has a heavy load over what is required to reduce her performance and reduce the likelihood that Navy will be able to insert things that will improve it in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have double the size of the same ships that the Germans used in World War II.
Apart from Hardwar’s problems, the entire project - including money to train a crew also has become a problem.
It is said to have reached at the estimated cost of £3.1.1 million ($3.6bn) - from .
New ships' problems are especially important as there are recent warnings that the power of the German Naval was falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Per Bartels, a German official of the parliament committee, admitted to Navy that it is well "recognizing the exit and entry of ships which can be used."
The officer said that problems have lasted a hundred years, since old ships were no longer functioning but no ships in place.
You are disappointed that no Baden-Wuttemberg-clas ships have been able to join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the hidden life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands area intended to reveal how bats use the shape of land when hunting food.
It is hoped that the results will give us better insight into the life patterns of these rare flying creatures and help to guide future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the popular singing past and the Daubenton bats with long black ears in Invewerwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be established in certain areas to test the work of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will do small checks using hand - held monitors.
A rational analysis of all records will show the frequency of bats ’ cryings and what certain animals do.
The map of the area and the report will be published to create a detailed picture of her life - style.
Rob Dewar, a NS game counselor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how these animals use them.
This information will help to see the benefits of environmental management such as meadow creation and the best way to preserve areas with bats and other animals related to them.
In Scotland and throughout the UK have been rare throughout the past century.
They are threatened with construction and development that affect the environment and the loss of it.
Electric and light - emitting devices can cause accidents, and so can paper that kills flies and building materials, as well as domestic cats.
The bats are not necessarily blind.
However, as they hunt for the night, their ears work far more effectively than their eyes when hunting an animal.
They use a sophisticated sensory system to locate animals and flying objects.
The NTS, which handles more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, consider bats to be important.
They have ten trained professionals, who do research on a regular basis, check where they live, and how to protect them.
The organization has even organized the first Scots and the onlyTreave bats in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the site David Thompson said that this is the ideal place for him to live in.
"Here in Threave is a very good place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and other good places.
But there is much about bats we can do, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us to understand more what he needs in order to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of testing whether bats exist before working in construction because it may be possible to destroy up to 400 female and young bats, virtually all living in the area.
bats are protected and forbidden by law to kill, torture, or disturb their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to come to help.
He said, "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species do not know what makes them live."
Ronaldo refuses charges of abuse as lawyers plan to pay for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of the charges that he had made against them as "false stories," saying that people want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers arranged to fine up the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has published these accusations.
This Portuguese performer and Juventus is accused of sexual abuse by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2002.
She reportedly paid him $375,000 for the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on the video Instagram Live with 142 million of his followers reportedly, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, finished these reports by saying "It's a false story."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false stories," says a hero who has been crowned with Ballon d'or five times on a camera.
"They are trying to build a name for themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They wanted to be popular by calling my name, but it was part of the work.
I am happy and everything is going well for me," adds the player, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are ready to bribe Der Spiegel for these charges, calling them "an unconventional report on personal life," says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will want to be replaced by the "reproaching of his reputation for the number equal to the number of charges against him, which is probably the most serious matter of man's recent violation of human rights."
This reported event is reported to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Cas Vega.
After meeting at the nightllub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room, where he is said to have been molested, in accordance with the papers installed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after this incident and told him that he was a "man ready" "99%" mistaken for "one percent."
The contents say that Ronaldo agreed to have sex relations between them, but they had agreed to each other.
Maorga also admitted to the police and took photographs of those who had been injured in the hospital, but later she admitted that the case was taken outside the court because she feels that she is “in fear of revenge" and is concerned about the ‘ social shame.'
The 34-year-old woman says that she now wants to change the agreement as she continues to be hurt by what is said to be happening.
Ronaldo was going to join the Real Madrid from the Manchester United at the time of the survey, and this year he changed to the large Italian group Juve to 480100 million.
Brexit: UK'll always regret the loss of car workers
UK "will always be sorry" if she does not lose her position as world leader in developing cars after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He has also added that Toyota UK has told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a contract it will temporarily stop the product in its plant at Burkaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer said that the result of slowing down when an unofficial contract with Brexit can result in a loss of jobs.
The Burma firm that made Auris and the Aveotas of Toyota produce about 150,000 cars last year and 90% of them sent to other countries in the European Union.
"I think that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March the product will stand in our industry," says Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota in Burma.
Some UK car manufacturers have feared coming out of the EU without agreement on how trade with other countries will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Today at Oxford industry after a month of Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car designers call danger if the Brexit agreements are not met.
The production of Toyota is carried on "According to the need of the time", parts of cars arrive every 37 minutes from surgeons both in the UK and in the EU by radio vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract in 29 March, there may be disturbances at the limits of which the industry claims can lead to drinking and the end of the building parts.
It is impossible for Toyita to handle more vehicles a day than they were built on their business in Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may have to be stopped.
Mr Clark says that Chequers' Cheres of Theresa May's future dealings with EU "is carefully adjusted to avoid that checkable."
"We need to get a contract. We want to get a better agreement that will allow us as long as not only success we will enjoy now but also to take advantage of this opportunity," tells the BBC Radio program.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other industrys is that we need to be fully able to carry out what is the age's emergency.
The Toyota could not determine how long the product will be established, but in time, it warns that additions will reduce industry efficiency and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallris, who has worked in Burkaston for 24 years and is a link to the U.S. plant industry, says that her members are worried: "In what I have seen when these jobs are gone again.
A government spokesman says: "We have established a clear and reliable arrangement for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be late again, says White House
The red - haired Donald Trump meeting with the general representative Rod Rosenstein may be "cut off by another pack" as the war of high court and the establishment of Brett Kavanaugh continues, says White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises a special strike by Robert Mueller, who analyzes Russian selection disorder, communication between Trump and Russia, and possible trouble of justice from the president.
Whether Trump will expel the universal representative, thereby endanger Mueller's freedom, it has provided Washington news that could not be discussed for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein has discussed the inserting of a pipe to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president's being expelled in the 25th tier.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday she went to the White House, although there are reports that she was about to quit.
Instead, meeting Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, is announced on Thursday.
Trump said that it is "not against you" to attack Rosenstein but that the meeting was late to avoid the case of the Senate judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both have been witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a single FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, further lowering the full appreciation of the Senate.
The journalist of Trump, Sarah Sanders, has come from Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosesstein, he said: "The date of what has not yet been laid, may be on this report, I think that will be replaced by another check as there are other things that continue with the high court.
But we will see and want to keep the media aware of what is happening.
Some news reporters may disagree with this: Sanders have never had a radio conference at the White House since 10 September.
The system administrator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of these meetings is not because the media "are talkful," although he said, "I will not deny the fact that they speak."
He then points out that there will be a number of connections between Trump and the news media.
"The president made more screens of questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, adding without any evidence: "We have looked at those numbers."
There will still be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media are able to ask direct questions, that's better than talking to me.
We are trying to do that many times and have seen us do much more in the last few weeks and will replace the media meeting if you are able to speak with the president of the United States."
Trump usually listens to questions when he leaves the White House or when sharing in public chat rooms or sessions of the media and respected guests.
He rarely picks up questions in private.
New York in this report the president has likely shown why, out of concern and sometimes by speaking thoughtlessly in front of the media.
Health secretary writes to the EU staff at NHS in Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The secretary of Health has written to EU employees working at Scotland’s NHS to show appreciation and worldly wishes to stay in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MCS sent a letter that had remained 6 months before the UK resigned to the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to pay the required expense of EU citizens ’ requests that work in behalf of the public.
In his book, Msz Freeman wrote: "In summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have moved on, looking to the decisions expected in this age.
But the UK Government has also been preparing its policies to be uncouthed.
I know that this may not be a pleasant time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work that all members of my staff, no matter where they live.
Our colleagues from the EU, and elsewhere, bring in a precious billion of skills and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, to the benefit of the patients and the communities in which they work.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."

Rod Reed instructor of Tennessee State has told the media that the damage has occurred just before the rest of the day.

The trainers and the medical personnel gave Abercrombie health care to the board before putting him in strecher took him back to check.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had finished surgery at the Vanderbil Medical Center.

Foreign consumers will be paid a higher percentage of the system when they buy an UK house
Buyers from other countries will be paid a higher percentage of the system when they buy a UK house to use this money to help the homeless under the new Tory programs
This will make Corbyn’s success in getting young people to vote
The increase of the system cash will be required on those who do not pay the UK tax.
Financial members expect to earn about £20 million a year to help the homeless
Buyers from other countries will be paid for the high - rise rent if they buy a UK - this house that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will proclaim today.
This will be considered an effort to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in trying to attract young people to vote for more cheap housing and to be viewed by people who are paid a lot of money.
The promotion of room cash will apply to people and businesses who do not pay the UK tax, and this additional amount will contribute to the government's efforts to eliminate homeless people.
This figure is added to the current state currency, including the high level of roses placed two years ago in two houses and sold in about 3 percent.
Financial figures expect this to give them about £1220 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's rebuilt homes are purchased by non-UK citizens, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to obtain homes.
The majority of the wealthy in this area — especially the capital - city — have become ‘ cities to cry out ’ because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend most of their time away from the country.
A new goal comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of the reduction of room pay to help more youths find their first homes.
You worry about the construction business by keeping up the building costs by taking up the building site and not using it, and urging Nkkz May to close the quotas to the purchase houses in order to fix the ‘reme of houses ’ in Britain.
Mr Coryn has announced a detailed series of proposed changes in the homes, including the management of rent and the elimination of the house "not in mistake".
He also wants to give the fireers greater strength to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: ‘ Last year I said I’m going to be dedicated to restoring Britain’s dream — that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing the sale of homes.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it would not be easy for non-UK persons, as well as for foreign companies, to buy homes rather than British hard workers.
For so many people the dream of having a house has become impossible, and the lack of respect for the streets is endless.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest desire is to be a Scottish trainer'
The Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that he has a "great desire" to be a Scottish trainer one day.
Ross, aged 42, desires the challenge of helping the North-East group, now the third in the League One, is left by the top three points.
You have moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Merren to return to Scottish Premiershipp in the past distress.
"I wanted to play for my country while I was playing.
I received a B copy and thus ended," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I have grown up watching Scotland many times in Hammden when my father was young, and it has been something I have always thought about.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as an instructor of a small group."
Primitive instructors in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allahyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, who served as an instructor for the Alloa Atlantic, says that he did not fear to join the main trainers in this large group, since he has refused requests from Barsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of me now will be determined to 'May I restore this group to the Premirer League?'
Because of the structure and structure of the group, no doubt they should enter the Premirer League, he said.
"It's not easy for me to get back, but I'll probably think I'm going to be successful where I'm going to return the group."
Ross has been an instructor for only three years, after a short time as an assistant to the trainer in Dambarton and 15 months as a trainer in Herats.
He then helped Alloa escape from the sword, and turned St Mirren almost consumed by the knife into Champoonship's master at the next door.
And Ross says that he feels more confident now than when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
"The things suddenly changed completely," you remember, by training Alloa.
"I was absolutely convinced that the training profession is good for me, more than being a player.
It sounds unreasonable because I could play well, live well, and enjoy some things.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to dealing with the stresses and pressures of work, but I love the training.
I have been seeking training for a long time and are now doing it, feeling that I am now doing something I want to do all my life as an adult."

The proper time for the pin is 5,30pm Saturday, says the review
The passage of summer has raised Britain’s tough, fast - moving lungs but heavy - loading restaurants.
Dozens of tubes and bars have been raised by consumers by 2.7 percent by July - but in restaurants have dropped 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of the sibunes constancy CGA, who has received these figures, says: "The continued success and participation of England longer is expected in World Cup means that July has followed the same course as the last month of June, where the tubes have risen by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants to cry down.
The decline of 1.8 percent in sales in restaurants in June has been particularly severe in July.
Drinking and barbs are more commercial than restaurants.
Lanterns also carry heavy food from the sun, although it has not been as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to get out of it will get a drink.
In tubes and bars the sale of alcohol has increased by 6.6 percent during the month, the food has dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a social analyst and host RSM, says: "These results continue what we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of large events or sports will always be powerful reasons when it comes to selling in the market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to attract harder, although sales have dropped by 4.8 percent each year will be painful in spite of ongoing cost problems.
The long hot summer has come to the food market, and in time it will appear that the low temperature we had in August will give us what we need."
The increase in the sales in restaurants and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating the reduction in the number of bills.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitor for selling a set of cables, rubber and UK restaurants, collects and analyzes the working data of 47 working groups, produces more than £9 million, and is the beginning of a developing industry.
One out of five children has secret contacts in chat rooms that he has hidden from his parents
One of five - - - year - olds has private accounts in chat rooms that have hidden them from their parents and teachers, creates a survey

Eliidh Doyle will be the "word of the players" on the Scottish Attics board
Eliidh Doyle has been selected by the Scottish Atthletics board as director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a popular Scottish player and chairman Ian Beattie described this act as a good opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from his wide million sporting events ten years ago.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all the players in the world, and we are sure that the games in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I’m willing to be a players' voice and hope to give more and help in directing sports in Scotland."

He wrote to Twitt: "Last month I was a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
The doctors said that it would be time for me to see whether I would recover or to what degree.
After a long recovery, I learned to walk and to exercise today!
Thank you for messages of encouragement!."
A mother - and - cow - feed campaign creates a break in the Internet
The breast pumping company has created a break in the Internet by an advertisement that compares breast - feeding mothers with beefs.
To note the introduction of what is said to be the "the first soundless breast pump in the world," Elvie’s client has produced a disciplinary video advertisement to show the new pump that gives the mother breast - feeding.
Four mothers dance a song to a herd with names, "Yes, I wash myself, but you can't see the tail" and say, "If you didn't see this, my breasts are not't."
The apple says, "Take out the bottle, take it out, bring it out, give it to the children, bring it out, throw it out, take it out, feed my friends."
However, this advertisement, printed on the Facebook page of the company, has created a controversy over the Internet.
The video with 77,000 who have seen and hundreds of concretes has received different views from viewers, when many say you are looking down on the "hard" milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
As for us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to give forth milk, unless their babies are taken a few days after birth, wrote another.
Elvie's breast pump enters and is hidden inside the breast block (Elvie/Mther)
Another said: "It’s a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But why don't you use it to advertise a breast pump that mothers can't keep their children?
Another said: "This advertising isn't suitable."
Some protected the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she got a song "laughing."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I were nursing it.
The pumping made me feel like a bull.
The advertisement is malicious, but I have heard it.
This product will be very useful," wrote another.
Another has added: "This advertisement is fun and refers to mothers who pump (usually in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cattle.
This is not an advertisement that glorifies or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video a group of women showed that they had been dancing with hidden pipes under their bras.
The aim of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast - feeding pumps say they feel they are really cattle.
But Elvie Pump, has no sound, has no strings or tubes and wears it hidden under the milkbrush, allows women to move, manage their children, and pull them out of the camp.
Ana Barin, a parent with ECD in Mother, has noted: "Elvie Pump is a product that will have a major impact and therefore qualified for the presentation in a clear manner.
By likening nursing women to cattle, we wanted to pump out the breasts and all its challenges in public, while expressing in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of freeing the new pump that will bring them.
This was not the first time Elvie pump was questioned.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from the architect Martha Jabowski using this product.
Hundreds of immigrants move peacefully to a tent camp at the border of Texas
The number of children taken out of the home has increased even though it has not changed the monthly number of those passing the border, partly because the hard - earned police fitted in Trump office made it difficult to provide support to children.
Often, many of the sponsors have become passports, and they have been afraid to risk their own existence in this area by pretending to be a parent.
The risk is severe in June, when the authorities announce that sponsors and other adult members of the home will have to send the fingers, and that the tire will be given to the local authorities.
Last week, Mattthew Albence, chief of the Immigation and Customs Enforcement, admitted before the Congress that this prison has bound many people who have registered to support children without parents.
The prison later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested were not guilty of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of non-supported or family members of the community are illegal in this case, and a large number are criminals.
So we continue to search for those people," says Mr. Alence.
In an effort to corrupt children quickly, the authorities have established new laws that will require some of them to appear in court during the month under arrest, not after 60 days, as a former policy, in accordance with the shelter staff.
Most will appear on the video network, not literally, to ask for legal rights from the arrival of the arrival judge.
Those considered unworthy will soon be deported.
If children stay in custody for long periods of time, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violence or to attempt to run away, in accordance with the shelters and the reports released from the system over the past months.
The lawyers say that the anxiety grows in a bigger center, such as Tornillo, where signs of child labor may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They also add that moving children to a tent without giving them time to prepare emotionally for themselves or to say good - bye to their friends can create many of the problems they already have.
Syria tells the US, France, and Turkey forces to launch quickly
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem has spoken to the Syrian refugees to return home, even if the war in their country is now its eighth year.
Mouelem, also the chief minister's commander, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, saying that they would put an end to terrorism, and "they will be treated properly."
"He must go immediately without subject," tell the audience.
Moulem maintains that ‘ the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this holy battle and to cleanse the whole part of Syria" from terrorist groups and "anyone from abroad."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who concentrate on training and directing forces in Kurdish and Arabia against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war - torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moulem says that circumstances allow them to return, and he blames "Some western countries" with the "drives" which prevent the refugees from returning.
He said, "We have spoken with the international community and the welfare of the people to make sure that refugees are coming back."
"They practice politics on a matter that should be addressed only to the welfare of the community."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not help her Syria again until a political agreement was made between Assad and the anti-war.
UN delegates said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for building a border at the last great antiheretic stronghold of his Idub apostates is an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian - Turkish treaty has prevented large - scale Russian - sponsored Syrian invasions in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulem emphasized that the agreement was "appointed a clear time" and hopes that the soldiers will attack the judadists and the Nustra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "will be annihilated."
UN Secretary of Defense de Mistura hopes that soon he will arrange for the first meeting of a new committee that includes government and opposing members to form the basis for the postwar term and plan the course of selection.
Moulem has set limits on the participation of the Syrian government to the committee, saying that the zone work should last "to examine the articles of the new constitution," and warned against rioting.
Why does Trump have a second choice?
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second choice in 2020 unless, as there are many non-smoking viewers who may wish to be so, are unfaithful and do the wrong that can replace him as president.
No doubt that "It will be the most significant conclusion in the president's history!"
Thus far, there are no signs of overcoming the subject.
Since 2014, CNN viewers have doubled to 1.5 million, and MNSBC viewers have tripled to 1.6 million.
Food News usually has 2.4 million spectators, ranging from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Show" has a peak of 3.5 million viewers in hot night news.
"People are curious because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama program called "Designated Survival," regarding the secretary of the secretary of the department who became president after the bombardel attack.
Nell Scovell, a red-incorn in the field of writing and development called "JUS the Fulny Parts: And a Very Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Bodys," has another opinion.
She remembers occasions when she used a text in Boston before choosing a 2016.
The driver told him that he would hire Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because you make me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
It is a pleasure to listen to and watch the news.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. distance, regardless of whether the immigrant family is getting along and the global economy.
Few people do.
And so, it is more than if an experienced citizen found you sitting for more than six hours watching the information court counters with the use of Bob Woodwar from a "deep background" in his book "Faar," the Paul Manafort’s brown coat cost $15,000 (" is a proud black coat," says Washington Post) and Stormy Daniels's graphic description of Mr. Trump.
I, for my part, would never again view Super Mario the same way.
"One of the things he does that makes it seem like a program to save a person's life is giving something every night," says Brent Montgomery, "Heelhouse Endainment and the founder of "Pawn Stars," talking about the change of people in Trump's schedule and daily conversations (N.F.L.L., praise Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside the world watcher for MSNBC and recording CNN.
It was unlikely that he would leave before it, since Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judith Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember the old times we make all these dull programs and people say, "This is the beginning of Western culture," says Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

The majority of the funds are placed in a middle-hour election of the House rivalry
Not surprisingly, 17 to 17 percent receive large sums of money, as a result of the reconstruction of the congregators that have come out with two officers on the same seat.
This newly developed Pittsburg region puts him in a competition Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is now running against another synod, Republican Keith Rothphus, now representing the old Pennsylvania region of 12, which is crossing to the 17th youth.
Maps were retyped after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that older provinces violated the law by stealing votes to the Republicans.
The competition from this 17th new issue has removed the financial competition between members of a large group, the Democratic Campional Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campal Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special choice in March that was observed by many people of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position had been occupied by the Republic for over ten years, President Donald Trump won the province by 20 pounds.
Politicians have given Democrats some opportunity.
U.S. gave consideration to punishing El Salvador by Supporting China, and Released
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had long noted Beijing, with a little supplication from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and was at a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization.
The State Department has decided to call the American executives of the iplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the ‘ recent decision not to work with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, who speaks for the door, says so at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador, with $140 million in assisting America in 2017, and in control of narcics, development and economic support.
A budget budget, which includes financial cuts and sets limits on proprietors, which could cause the country of Central America to feel the pain of unemployment and murder.
As their conferences progressed, officials from North America and Central America withdrew a high conference focused on security and economic development to follow the same gathering last year that was considered a step forward of efforts to prevent settlers from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, high administrative officials made it clear that they wanted a conference to continue, effectively eliminating any idea of the payment of El Salvador.
President Mike Pence now has to arrange to speak to the council, now scheduled to be in the middle of October, as a sign brought by the authorities to the conference, says the officials.
And the three representatives of the United States returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House Speaker of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officers, including two messengers, who agreed to discuss the internal intentions of the secrecy.
Their accounts are verified by an external editor close to the rulers and spoke of the state of secrecy.
A Lesson From History
The following incident may be the report of a special counselor by Robert Mueller against Mr. Trump, and there is now a direct evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign had been linked with Russia in its efforts to attack our choice.
If the Congress change, Mr. Trump will find himself face - to - face with this body, as he prepares to appear before the voters, and perhaps finally before the court.
This has many limitations, and I do not mean that Mr. Trump’s fall is certain to happen or that his fellows in Europe will come about.
There are decisions that all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic will affect the length of the exchange.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d'ét against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed out on the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such events, and the stringent efforts to make the majority of people strong or out of control over the years.
Americans face many of these events now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump expels Deputy Atturney General Rod Rosenstein, man who controls Mr. Mueller's research?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since the paper reported that, in the past year, he suggested privately to the president and mentioned his failure to do his work.
Mr. Rosenstein says the article of The Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if a new requested inquiry by F.B.I. of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust — or if it is put in the High Court in spite of charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do that, the desire of the majority will not be satisfied for a long time.
But I believe we will never fail, because of a lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz, the same Nazi regime that once ruled my domain.
She survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a sistica table.
With that as an inheritance, how is it that I have no hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans hope as the game draws closer with Rapid Vienna
Ringers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory for the Austrians, after playing the same size in Spain and Villarreal this month, will put them at a good chance to pass through the European Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevents stomach athlete Graham Dorrans from having to play the first time of grief until the game is equal to 2-2 Villarreal but believes that Ringers can use those effects to look forward to big things.
"It's good to get this point because Villarreal is a good playing team," says this 31 - year - old player.
"We went out in the game believing that we would return with something and get the point.
We may have a score at the end of the game, but, besides, the game is just right as well.
They played better with the first team than we did, and with the second doubling step, it became our best to play.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope that we will get three points but will be a hard game because they have played well in the past but because our followers will be encouraging to us, I’m sure we will play and get good results.
The last year of hardship, during all that has happened with my injuries and changes in the group itself, but it seems that things will improve now.
The group is pretty nice and the players happy; the training is also enjoyable.
We hope that we will work now, and have gone through the past tragedy and have won't."
Women cannot sleep because they are afraid of the issue of retirement
Despite having a clear view of their need for care, few people actually spoke to their families about it.
Almost half of the people in a global survey say that they talk to their spouses about long - term, long - term expenses.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but don't take the initiative to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, president of the Nationwide life insurance policy.
Let these be started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot be prepared to provide physical support to your family if you do not have time to do so.
Work with your family to discuss how you will receive and where you will be available, because the choices will contribute greatly to the cost.
Here is your financial adviser: Your advice can also help you to find a way to pay back the amount.
Your long - term financial decisions may include the goal of a long - term insurance policy, a life insurance policy that pays if you pay for these expenses or become a health insurance policy — as long as you still have money.
Prepare your fundamentals: Avoid legal battles.
Find a health - care program to appoint a trusted person to care for your medical matters and to make sure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are unable to speak.
Consider, too, the perer of attorney in your currency.
You will choose someone whom you trust to make decisions for you and make sure that your expenses are paid when you can no longer do anything.
Do not forget details: Imagine your elderly parent who is in an emergency situation and is rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and health problems?
Make a list of such activities as planned, well.
"Not only are funds to be cared for, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What trees?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a program available.."

Government officials are seeking an unusual death sentence on the NYC victim
The U.S. government prosecutors in New York sought the death sentence of the Saphul Saipov, a New York City terrorist attorney who killed eight persons -- an extraordinary sentence that has never been carried out in the area since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used the Home Depot to attack the West Side Higway bicycle route in Lower Manhattan, killing people on foot and bikes in that way by October.
In order to make him the victim of execution, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov has deliberately killed eight people and that he has deliberately wounded them physically, in accordance with the notice of the death penalty, published by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts carry the weight of the death sentence, in line with the court’s decision.
A few weeks later, the appeal court handed down 22 cases involving eight murder charges, often used by government prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and traffic destruction.
The attack required "organization and good consideration," said the prosecutors, explaining how Saipov has done it as "bad, cruel and shocking."
"Sayfullo Habillaevic Saipov has wounded, killed families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hern Ferruch, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dagnucco's announcement.
Five of them were Argentine guests.
It has been ten years since the New York Southern District ended up handling the death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, is charged with killing two drug personnel but finally spent a lifetime in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence in New York's case was in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples who were murdered after being convicted were convicted of passing on information during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to court statements.
He told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov has told the authorities that he had made this attack to watch ISS videos on his telephone, in accordance with his comments.
He also asked for a sign of Isis in his hospital room, the police said.
He said he had no charge on the sides of which he was 22.
David Patton, public defense representative of Saipov, says "they are as discouraged as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than accept a request to be sent to prison without a period of release will only ease the shock in these cases for all involved," says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
The Dory Manager says that NIGFRAG should direct conversations with Brexit
Nigel Farage vowed 'to organize a society today during protests in the Tory Council.
A former Ukip leader says that politicians had to be ‘ tortured by Eurosceptics - since one of Theresa’s ministers said she should be the head of the talks and the EU.
An unremitting member Peter Bone told the rioters in Birmingham that the UK's ‘ may have left' if Mr Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Nkkz May faces in gathering members of his divided group are marked by members of the Tory adults joining a different protest against Brexit in the city.
The General is unable to keep his Chequers system of surrendering in spite of an assault on members of Brexit, Remainers, and the EU.
Some members insist that they will continue trying to make an agreement with Russells in the face of conflict — and force the Euroceptics and Labours to choose between his ‘ puzzle'.
Mr Bone told the Leve Means Levave riot in Solihull that you want to ‘ finish with Cheques'.
Mr Farage was to be made a pillar and given work to contact Brussels.
‘ If it had been the one in charge,' he would have gone out now, saying.
This Headway has added: 'I will represent Brexit but we need to finish with Chequers.'
Describing his disagreement with the EU, he says: ‘ We have not fought in the wars of the world to be slaves.
We want to make our own rules in my country.'
Mr Bone has published proposals that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed the mind and want to remain just not true.'
Andrea Jenkyns of Tory, who supports the Brexit, was also in the riot, telling the surveyers: 'What I say is: Sir, listen to the people.
'People don't want Chequers, the opposing group will not vote for them, our group doesn't want our people and ours who are walking the streets and having us voted for the first time.
Please forget Cheques and begin to listen.'
In a straightforward sermon to Nkkz May, he said: 'The general will continue to carry out their duties if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the politician in the riot that they must be ‘ pressed ’ if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 draft.
‘ This is now a matter of loyalty between us - peoples and our political class, ’ he said.
'They try to be dishonest to Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'We won't let you do that'.'
In a strong order he told the crowd, 'I want you to make them a class of politicians, who are now in danger of breaking up Brexit, to feel oppressed.
‘ We are using a worldly army that has given us victory over Brexit and will not give up and become a independent, independent country, a proud, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers rioted in Birmingham before having a two - hour call to the city.
The principal prelates carried the placards entitled Tories Against Brexit after the group was established in the report.
A member of the Labour Lord Adonis made a joke to Conservatives about the safety problems they had with a group applet when the conference was opened.
'These are people who tell us that they can set the IT masts with all the Canadian and other technology, the trouble - free border, free trade outside the borders of Ireland, adding.'
‘ It’s a complete destruction.
Nothing called Brexit is good, adding.
Warren's "Watch out" programs to enter the president's selection
The U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says "to consider taking the president's selection" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat spoke of its future in a city hall west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, always critical of President Donald Trump, joins the choice to be reregistered in November against the GOP Rep. State Geoff Diehl, who served as assistant of Trump in the 2016 Massachusetts project.
She was at greater risk that she could compete with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Hokuka was his 36th meeting using the city hall since Trump became president.
In all cases, you have called up a question about whether to enter a selection.
Warren replied that it is time for the "women to go to Washington to correct our corrupt government, and that includes the woman who is to become president."

Russian Grand Price: Lewis Hamilton is close to a world fair after following the directions of a group that enabled him to conquer Sebastian Vettel
It is only evident that Vallter Bottas won over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes party's guidelines will play a major role in the contest.
From the beginning, Bottas started well and likely argued with Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his gang member.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be stopped by the group's smoke, which should have been a decisive factor.
Mercedes entered a pit after the cycle and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton is forward after a competition that made the Ferrari driver be forced to leave the inside safely after two precautions to protect the third eye.
Max Versappen started at the back line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21 birthday.
He then leads a large part of the race as he has continued his wheels so that he can concentrate on completing quickly and pass by Kim Rainkonen to the fourth.
She finally reached pits in the 44 cycle but was not able to speed her pace on the remaining eight turns as Raikkinen was the fourth.
It is a difficult day because Valtriti has done a good work every weekend and has been kind enough to pass over me.
The group did a commendable job to have 1-2, says Hamilton.
His Steerings Make He Rich
President Donald Trump has laughed at the Senior Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday session as he insisted that he had not shown a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh on cases of sexual abuse.
Speaking to a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by the Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but rather stated that what had happened to Senate has shown that people were ‘ inconsiderate and unkind and disloyal.
"One thing that could happen with a good thing in the last few days of Senate, if you see anger, when you see people who are angry and unkind and dishonest," says."
"When you look at the broken news and say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinsstein, have you told someone?
You remember her answer... Someone sent you the statement "Oh, Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have sent no one."
Well, wait a minute.
We have sent him... No, we have sent no one," says, referring to the solar.
Feinstein was sent a detailed letter about Kavanaugh's trial by Ford back in July, and it appeared at the beginning of September - but Feinstein denied that the document was coming out of his office.
"I didn't conceal the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't send anyone," Feinstein tells the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it secret, and I have kept it as secret as you asked me."
But his refusal was not well understood by the president, who observed during a Saturday evening gathering: "This is what I will say, the movement of his body to the rich.
He may not have done it, but the movement of his body is rich.
Continuing in his defense of the Supreme Court, accused of three women of abuse, the president said that Democrats used charges in their own interests.
"He is willing to fight for control of anything he can do.
You see a lack of kindness, indifference, concern about who is hurt, who should pass over to rule and control," reports the Mediaate in terms of the president's statement.

These groups have met for the fourth time, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
The first Dwyer wheel entered at 3:35 when a ball was fitted from Kendall McFaulll, it was fitted by David Rutherford's ball while Beauvillier hit the second wheel four minutes later.
In a series of years earlier, Sullivan gave hope to a group that had been playing in the home at 13: 10 before Matt Marquardt sent a ball to Cownie when he hit the line by 15:16.
Dwyer has seen that the Giants take the lead when they go on vacation when they hit his second team on the same day toward the end of the first grade.
The team that was playing at home is returning dramatically, and Bouchard again struck a fine line of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have come together to help Nielsen hit Dundee's top athlete for the first time in the game toward the end of the second grade and made sure that they won the game by the fifth time they finished the game.
The Giants, who have now been killed in their games four times ago, played at home with Milton Keynes on their next Friday.
An Air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people on the plane could survive an earthquake
The flight director in Indonesia is credited after death to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people arrives safely on the ground.
More than 800 people have died, and many have not yet been found after the major earthquake that struck the island of Surawesi on Friday, which started the tsunami.
There is a strong movement to continue the attack, and many are confined to the city of Palu.
But even though their partners had fled to escape, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave work at the construction that we were trying to control aircraft in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the port of Palu.
She stayed to make sure that Batik Air Fight 6321, on the route, would be able to move away safely.
Then he jumps out of the control tower at the moment he thinks we are on the run.
She later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could save hundreds of people, reports Australia's ABC News.
We have arranged for a helicopter from Baliivepan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we failed and have died this morning before the plane arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are sad to hear about this," he has added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the dead can reach thousands, as health services at this disaster say that it is not easy to enter the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boundering.
"We believe that the number of dead is still rising as many corpses are still under the ruins while many are beyond our reach," says urologist Sutopo Pro Nugroho.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] waves have destroyed Pallu that will have many people's funeral on Sunday.
War planes and transport bring relief supplies and life’s necessities.
Risa Kosuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: Every minute and every minute a ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Markets have been stolen everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the international Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross helps the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a disaster, but it can be worse.
The Indonesian President Joko Widonda came to Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "I beg all of you to work day and night to complete all the work in connection with the removal of people.
Are you ready?" Save the CNN.
Indonesia was struck early this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Microscopic plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one person is lost after a crash in the flagoon crash
The airline that controls a crash plane in the Pacific ragoon in Micronesia now says that there is one person out of sight, after all 47 passengers and crew aboard the landing plane safely.
Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, she will not be able to tell about a male passenger.
Airline says that she has worked with local officials, hospitals, and inspectors to try to find the man.
Airline did not respond immediately when asked to produce details of this passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats help other passengers and crew after the plane breaks down in the water while attempting to sail to the Chuuk Island on the airport.
The officers said that on Friday 7 persons were taken to the hospital.
Airline says that 6 passengers are left in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in good condition.
What caused the plane crash and how it happened is not clear.
Airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the flagoon cloud has not yet reached the airport track.
Some witnesses think that the plane has passed the track.
American passenger Bill Jayes said that the cloud is on the water at a low speed.
"That's really good," says Jayne.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to walk in water that kept their waist on their way to emergency exits.
He said that the flight attendants were anxious and talking, and that he was slightly wounded on his head.
The local crew, says U.S. Navy, also improve the wharf when rescue is launched by using a passenger boat to get to shore before the plane sinks (some 100 feet [100 m]).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 11 people have died in a PNG-reputed airline crash over the past 20 years, but no one includes Air Niugini.
Analyst identifies the nighttime time of a woman who has been burned alive
The prosecutor appealed Saturday on a man's case against a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for many hours as an expert witness in the field of sleeplessness.
He explained to the judge's jury how he used the telephone records to find the places that 29 - year - old Judge Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, had died on the night he died.
Rowlett has found details about the location of several telephone lines that indicated that Tellis had cashers on the afternoon of his death, contradicting what he said at the beginning, reports The Clarion Ledger.
There the data shows that his phone was in Chambers during the time he had a friend; and Michael Sanford, the police went to talk with Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was speaking truth when he said that he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "they were calling because his truck was in Nashville."
One of the exceptions is that Tellis said he had known Chambers two weeks before his death.
The phone records indicate that they were dating for one week.
Rowlett says that at some point before the death of Chambers, Tellis turned off Chekler's e - mail, telephones, and communications information.
"He brought him out of his life," says Hale.
The trial is arranged for him to begin speaking on Sunday.
The judge says that the case is expected to appear in the jury’s congregation on that day.

A child guard in New York accuses a man and his wife by dismissing him with prejudiced words after receiving a message from the mother of the child who has entered into the mistake of "She was another black man."
The parents deny that they are prejudiced, saying that the charges are made for the ‘ financial profit. ’

"NoONOOOOOM," writes Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in writing to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Mrs.

Msz. Maurice was paid for her work one day and then moved home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is accusing the parents of being unjustly evading her, and she wants the compensation for 350 months of 6 months, as well as the live-in gig, without a bribe.

He is not partial.
We are not prejudiced people," says husband Joel Plasco.
"But can you leave your children and the man with whom you have been green, even with error?
Your newfound child?

The Paddington publishers were afraid that students would not like this file, revealing the newspaper
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was popular, said in the book, "It is hard to put yourself in a person's shoes for the first time.
It is a pleasure now to know what we know about's success in Paddington's progress.
He says that his father, who worked at BBC as a photographer before being moved to write a book about a small toy bear, would not be disappointed if his work was not popular, added 60th anniser's printing of his books after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as "the most important family value," he added that his father was not interested in his success.
"He was a quiet man, and was not proud, telling them."
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had done something: you are proud of it even if it didn't work for you.
I guess he viewed Paddington's success in that way.
Even if he was introduced and thought, he always commended Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to telephone her
When her daughter receives her daughter to be rushed to the Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur, where doctors work hard to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it is too bad, that he doesn't expect to survive," says Mrs. Ednan-Lapehouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad saying that he would die two minutes since now, and I had to apologize to him.
And I said good - bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, but you are quiet."
I will be with you in the near future.
I will be with you.
The medication that doctors prescribed for her to keep her heart beating slowly has decreased and has become dehydrated.
She had died some time before, and this was no longer working.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be truly self - controlled.
Eventually Mrs. Edna-Lapehouse, now grieving her dead daughter, flew in with other passengers clearly because of the traumatic situation she was facing.
"No one knew," he told them.
"I looked down, and tears fell all the time.
It is hard to explain, but it is while I was on the plane when I felt sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved her.
A woman wears cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in death worked together to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been carrying the cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use to get help.
Nksz Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," says Mrs. Davis.
Nksz Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a cook who had a promise for the future and when he smiled at everyone.
"All people were aware of its smile.
They would always say that when you smiled, it all seemed good.
Nevertheless, she quit her job before she died, since she was very depressed.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the first to find him after he committed suicide.
Mksz Davis said: "I always worry that something is going to happen about the same thing."
Nksz Davis began making cards, "In order to let people know that they can talk to them, even if they are friends.
Don't shut down your feelings and talk to them."
Msz Humphreys, a friend of Nksz Davies for many years, lost his life to Mark, his 15-year-old manager, just after his mother's death.
"She didn't say that she felt low or depressed or said something," she relates.
"A few days before Christmas we noted a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was on the ground in one way or another when the children opened their presents he didn't look at them or do something."
He said that his death was extremely difficult for them, but they had to cope with it: "There is a lot of space in the family.
It pains us very much.
But we must all continue to fight.
If it is difficult to cope with the loss, you can call the Samritans free of this number of 116 1233 (UK and Ireland), e-mail yo@sarritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website.
The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain as the FBI begins an interrogation
"I thought, if we could actually find something like what she had been looking for - arguably, not a hundred, it could bring a serious contagion," says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that she was afraid that the committee would be "divided" since there were many.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican sponsors want the FBI do research?
The reason for their procrastination is related to time.
The choice during the period will come about five weeks, on November 6 - U.S. date, as expected, the failure of the Republicans, and so it will be weakened in their efforts to find the person who wants to be selected in the highest court.
George W. Bush has been taking the telephone calling the Jesuits, encouraging them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at White House for Mr Bush and there he met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr Bush.
What happens when the FBI has published its report?
There will be a Senate selection, consisting of 51 Republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get about 50 votes from Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president's vice president, to separate him and put him in the Supreme Court.
Northern Korea’s rebels were ‘ shrinking ’ under Kim
The number of rebels from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says a South Korean law expert.
Park Hibiong-seug, quoting details of the South Allied door, says that last year there were 1,127 rebels - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that border laws are firmly established between North Korea and China and the high cost required by underground import workers has a great impact.
Pyongngang did not mark the public.
A large number of revolts from the North eventually gain the rights of citizens in South Korea.
Seoul says that over 33,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled near China, which has a long line with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitariald Zone (DMZ) with protection between two Koreas.
China considers these rebels to be nonconformists, not runaways, and sends them back to their countries by forced labor.
The relationship between the Northern and the South that is still at war in some sense has improved dramatically in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of these two countries met in Pyingngang to discuss the establishment of nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the historic June convention between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several methods of nuclear disarmament in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed the US authorities for taking action since then.
"Unless the US is still confident, there will be no hope for the security of our country and under those circumstances, we will never close our own weapons first," says Mr. U.e. in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelousi calls Brett Kavanaugh, saying that he is not qualified to serve in the High Court
The leader of the Small House Group Nancy Pelousi called the choice of the High Court Brett Kavanaugh as a ‘ controlled one ’ and said that his emotions did not allow him to work in the High Court.
Pelous says these words in a Saturday discussion in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I realized that if a woman ever acts in this way, she will be said to be ‘ governed by feelings,' said Pelousi with her answer to the words of Kavanaugh before the Senaciaciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at an early age.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh spoke and expressed emotions, among other things, as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He further published the Democrats to the committee, calling the charges against them the "Man-insured error in an organized manner to be killed" arranged in protest that Hillary Clinton was defeated in a 2016 election.
Pelousi believes that Kavanaugh's evidence indicates that he will fail in the High Court, since it shows that he is against the Democrats.
"I think he doesn't fit in those words and how he spoke about the Clinton and Democrats," says."
Pelousi refused when asked if he would try to accuse Kavanaugh if put, and that Democrats received many seats from the House of Representatives.
"This is what I shall say -- If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, it means that he is not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for his present court case," says Pelousi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat is concerned that Kavanaugh may judge against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Away, as it is thought to be the judge for it.
When questioned, Kavanaugh did not answer the questions of whether he could answer some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional person to go to court and be expected to say, 'until it is right,' says Pelousi.
And Women Need to Use Their Power.
Proper criticism, months, and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to get rid of it than to cry.
"We cry when we're upset," "Nksz. Stein told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, "I was very much helped by a prostitute, who said that she cried when she was upset, but found out that when she was upset and cried, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think I’m sorry because I cry."
I’m upset.'
Then he proceeded.
And I think that's good.
Tears flow as a result of mankind’s desperate need for relief.
One of my memories in the first job, the office that was full of men, when I found myself crying out because of the anger I could not describe, was pulled from my stout neck into an unlikely neck that I was always afraid to be pulled off the stairs.
"Make sure they don't see you cry at all," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry and mad.
They think you are upset and will be happy because they have found it."
Patricia Schroeder, was a Democratic cogresswoman from Colorado, and worked with Gary Hart when he was in his favor.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught committing adultery in a vessel called Monkey Businesss and was released from election, Msz. Schroeder, very angry, he realized he could not fulfill his desire to enter the election as president.
"It wasn't a well- thought decision," she said that to me she was laughing 30 years later.
"Long more than 7 others in the race, and a joke waits for the other one.
One he calls "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, she had no money to advertise, so she vowed that she would not enter the race until she had $2 million.
It was a war I could not defeat.
He found that some of his clients who gave him $11,000 million from men could give him $250.
"Do they think I get a fine?" she asked.
When he announced that he would not engage in an organized campaign, he was deeply impressed by the gratefulness of the people who had supported him, the frustration of a ring that had made it difficult for him to gather funds and seek out votes instead of members, and anger over discrimination against women who had been caught up in it.
"You would think I was crazy," recalls Mrs. Schroeder and how the media responded to him.
"You can think Klenex will be a cosphere.
I remember thinking, ‘ Where are they going when they will bury me in my grave? ’
"Did you cry"?"
How a U.S. - China trade war can be profitable in Beijing
Salvos that open trade between the US and China were close to hearing, and as the war is far from the end, the exchange between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, says experts.
Donald Trump, President of the US, gave the first warning early this year by selling goods sent to China, including electric, steel, and aluminium.
The largest event took place in this report by new fissures that deal with the cost of up to $200 billion ($50, U.S.), by adding half of all US imports from China.
Beijing has responded to each time in the same way, recently placed between 5 and 10 percent of America's cost of $60 million.
China has asked for an average US, and the second - largest economy in the world is less likely to fall.
To make Washington shrinks means to close the corner with its demands, but bowing down to the US can be quite embarrassing to X Jinping, president of China.
Still, researchers say that if Beijing can act wisely, the pressure of a war - trade against the US can reap China for a long time by reducing the cooperation between both parties.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that can cause economic problems in both countries is more dangerous than those who have seen it before," says Abigail Grace, a research researcher who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a mental area.
Syria's ‘ ready to return to refugees, ’ says the Foreign Minister
Syria says she is ready to return to the refugees and seek help to rebuild a war - torn world for seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al-Moulem says that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in this world is calm and safe because of progress made against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore victims ’ lives to normal areas.
All situations now permit the willing return of refugees to a country where they had to flee because of terrorism and the oppressive economic systems that plagued their daily lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled this area since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other 6 million people still living in this area need life's help.
Al-Moulem said that the kingdom of Syria could enjoy the help of rebuilding a war - torn land.
But he insisted that they would not receive limited help or help from lands associated with the revolution.
Europe won a victory for the Lydia Cup in Paris
The European team won in 2018 the Ruder Cup by breaking the USA Group with 16.5 - 10.5 points on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now been fed six times in Europe and has never won the Lydia Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has again received this prize as the Danish captain gang Thomas Bjorn reached the 14 points it needed to conquer the United States.
The US fo'c'sle Phil Mickelson, who had been heavily loaded for almost all this race, put his to-dot in the water at par-3 hole of 16, was the game held by Francesco Moninari.
The Italian golf player Moninari has played well on all his teams, being 1 to 4 to 0 since the current match date began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth is released at 5&4 by the lowest level of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top player, Dustin Johnson, was awarded 2 and 1 by England’s Ian Poulter, which may have been his last to play on the Ruder Cup.
The forerunner of the eight Rudder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia won more than any other event in Europe on 25-5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I'm unable to hold back.
That was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and putting my trust in me.
I am very happy, and I am glad that we have a cup again.
We work for a team., and I am happy I have been able to help," says Garcia after winning Europe.
She extends the job to her cousin John Ram who has broken the US guillotine Tiger Woods in 2&1 on Sunday players.
"I am really proud, by breaking up Tiger Woods, and growing up to see him," says 23- year- old Rahm.
Woods has won all four of his games in France and now has a 13-2-3 record on the Ruds Cup record.
Unique figures are one of the most famous players in history, which has overcome 14 major matches only the second to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has carried hardly a whole weekend in order to get rarityes except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who play high - level golf throughout the race.
US captain Jim Furryk has spoken after his group's uncomfortable game, "I’m proud of our players, they've worked.
There was a time in the morning when we had to suppress Europe.
We didn’t.
Thomas has used it.
He is a fine captain.
All 12 of his players are very good at playing.
We're going to fix it, and I'll work with the PGAA of America with our Ruder Cup Committee, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be a captain.
You should advise your captain.
We're broken off."
Back to Red Tide: Numbers decrease in Pinellas, Manatea, and Sarasota
A new report from Florida Fish and the Wildlife Commission shows a drop in the Red Tide in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, variations in the Pinellas, Manuta, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier areas are reported to indicate a reduction in numbers.
The Red Tide product is growing about 130 miles [130 km] along the coast from north Pinellas to south of Lee areas.
Differences are found in about 10 miles [10 km] from the Hillsborough County, but in a few places than in previous weeks.
Red Tide has also been observed in the Pasto County.
Extensive figures in the area or from the coast of Pinellas County have been reported in the past, down-to-state numbers from the Hillborough County coast, back to the highest peaks of Mantà County, back to the highest numbers between or far from Sarasota County coast, back to the midpoint of Charlotte County, back to the highest numbers between the region of the Charlotte County, back to the highest numbers between the middle or far from the Lee County coast.
The respiratory disorder continues to be reported in Pinellas, Mantate, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier areas.
The respiratory disorder was not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
