A metal needle disappears from the surface of the water because of the force of water coming to the surface.
Surface radiation occurs when water molecules at the top are closer than the oxygen molecules on the surface.
The water molecules that form an invisible layer over the surface of the water create a spherical elastic fissure.
It consists of two layers of ice, one at a time and the other at a time. These two parts make it easier to hold the ice or ice, though they are relaxed.
Since the weight has a slight upward curve, when the metal is in the opposite direction, it is in the other end of the ice.
