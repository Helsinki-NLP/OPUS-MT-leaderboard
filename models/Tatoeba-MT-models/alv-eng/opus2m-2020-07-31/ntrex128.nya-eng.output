Parliament counselors are concerned with the matter of ‘ appearing foolish ’
There is confusion among the directors of some Parliament with the idea that their head should change as MWPs (Mamber of the Welsh Party).
It has been the result of the proposed change in the name of the convention as the Welsh Parliament.
Officials of various political parties are concerned that this might lead to ridicule.
A member of the Afour Parliament said that his organization was concerned that it might be "sounded like Twp and Pwp."
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh tup means the basics and pwp means you.
One member of the Plaid Parliament said that the whole group was "not happy" and will develop other methods.
One of the Welsh Conservative said that his group was ‘ open to other opinions" on the change of the name, but they realized that it was a short statement from MWP to Muppet.
In this case the Welsh w is also referred to in Yorkshire sign language.
The Convention Commission, which is currently forming laws to establish the name, stated: "The final resolution in selecting members of the Assembly Hall members is something to be considered by those members."
The Welsh Constitution of 2017 authorized the Welsh Parliament to change the name.
In the month of June, the Court released the results of human research where it found that people agree with the idea of changing the building's name into the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the head of the House of Commons, the Court favored the name Welsh Palace Memmers or WMPs, but the MWP opinion received a great deal of confirmation when it was addressed to the public.
Ams appears to make other decisions, but the struggle to achieve unity can become a major problem for Leader Elin Jones, who is expected to give an uncertain rule about the change within weeks.
The principle of the amendment also includes other changes in the operation of a legal institution, including the laws in casting out directors of the Assembly Hall and the makeup of the committee.
The Court’s counselors will receive the final vote on the question of what the building will be named after the law is discussed.
Macedonians have gone to vote in order to change the world’s name
People will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the " Republic of North Macedonia".
A race of well - known men was set up in order to settle the long - standing conflict with neighboring Greece, an area called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that the name of her northern neighbors obscures the meaning of the region and has repeatedly refused to participate in an invitation to enter the EU with NATO.
The president of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the idea of a name change, said that he would not vote.
However, those who want the name to be changed, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are said to be the key to the entry of the EU and NATO
St. Martin’s Silenced by Harlem’s Churches
"According to history, the adults I spoke to say there were drinking and church drinking places everywhere," said Mr. Adams.
"Now, there's no such thing."
He also said that the absence of alcohol would make sense.
"People have different social contacts" these days, he said.
"Alcots are not places where people go frequently."
As far as congregations are concerned, they are concerned that the sale of goods will not be as long as the leaders expect, "and will soon return to where they began."
He also said that churches may be replaced by tall buildings with areas filled with people who could not help the surrounding holy sites.
"Many of the people who will buy the building rooms are whites," he said, "and why is it hurrying the day these congregations will be closed together because most of those who move there will probably be members of these churches."
All these churches were formed in the Western community of Harlem before the arrival of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, as well as in St. Martin ten years later.
The first Western Methodist congregation had gone away in the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of black people who worshiped nearby had seized the building.
St. Martin's was adopted by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the anti-submarine traders at 125th Street, the main shopping route to Harlem, who refused to work or advance blacks.
The fire that broke out in 1939 left the building completely destroyed, but when Mr. Johnson’s team set up the building, they set up several towers.
Father David Johnson, Mr. Johnson's son also next to St. Martin's, proudly called the set bells of the poor.
The expert who played the flower during July called one of them: "The traditional treasure" and "the constant instrument of the destruction."
Scholar Tiffany Nggwe of the University of Michigan, also said that this is the world’s first black bells to be played by a musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
A Merweather said St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months has been a challenge for architects and architects, some of whom have been brought in by lay church leaders, others by Episcopal death.
A regular parish church board, made up of private leaders, had written the dayosi in July, worried that the tayossisisi is always in use, although the church members did not always participate in the construction and employment of the architects who were sent to work on the project.
Some of these churchgoers are constantly troubled by the dark side of this holiday.
shark injured a 13 - year - old swimming child in California
When shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday who was performing swimming in Callaphono on the first day of swimming, the authorities said.
The incident took place before 7: 00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was performing swimming with his friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy call for help and then went up with the mob to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first they thought I was always a cock crowing, but then he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I’m beaten!
I’m upset!'
On all his face, "Hammel said he realized this as soon as he came to where the boy was.
"I called everyone to get out of the water: 'In the water you have a shark!' Hammel added.
The boy was taken by plane to the Rayy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was registered on the side of the patient.
The kind of shark that had harmed him is unknown.
The Captain Captain Copt. Larry Giles said at a press conference that sharki had been observed in this area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed that it was not of harmful nations.
Gilles added that the victim has been seriously injured in land.
The authorities closed off the reach of the people from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Skimi Ekinitas for 48 hours to investigate and develop local security systems.
Miles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many do not seem to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's goal is to set up a beauty market at UK market
Sainbury's competition with other sellers such as Bots, Superrdrug, and Debenhams, who have stores with colorful sections and shelves that have other professionals.
As an extension of the UK model market for $2.8bn, which continues to grow during a time when the stock market of clothes and household goods is going back, a beautiful store with the opportunities were tried in 11 stores throughout the country and went to other stores the following year if it proved successful.
An idea of the beauty industry has come up with a search for TV shelves, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's note can double the size of jewelry that has been donated to 3,000, including in such countries as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Sales from L'Oral, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also find many areas with similar symptoms found in stores such as Bots.
This carpet also produces a Shope to sell cosmetics so that more and more things are linked to people who do not eat the meat that young buyers prefer.
In addition, Fraser Shop’s seller will try to sell in two Saiinbury's stores, the first opened to Croydon, south of London, the last week and the second to be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Buying on the Internet and changing how to buy small foods each day in nearby stores means that the shopping centers have to do much to attract people.
A Mike Coupe, chief of Sainbury's, says that the market will look as if stores have sections while the supermarket is full of branches trying to combat the Aldi’s low - tree shop and Lidl supplying more and more than food.
Sainsbury's search for Argos markets in hundreds of stores and has also established a number of private settlements since it bought two branches over the past two years, which claim to have strengthened the sale of stores and made the market more profitable.
The recent attempts at the store to remodel its beauty and drug market failed.
Sainsbury's attempt to join the Booths in the first two years of 2000, the treaty ended after a disagreement that could divide money from the drug stores in its supermarket was a large one.
This new approach came after Sainsbury sold his 281 drug - market business in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for $125, three years ago.
Lloyd was also said to take part in this work, adding to the number of skin care systems in addition to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of commerce at Sainbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and sound of our beautiful doors to decorate the shopping area.
We have also spent a lot of money on well - trained friends who will be present to finance the project.
Our kind of goods were designed to adapt to every need and to the beauty and easy access to it means that we are now a fascinating place that opposes the old method of buying.
Peter Jones was' angry because of leaving Holly Willoughby for $111 million.
An expert at the Dragans Den Peter Jones was left 'in anger' because of the release of TV revealer Holly Willoughby on a £11 million of his high - quality business to supervise his new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to manage their Truly business to sell home clothing and other items.
Both trade had been compared with Goop’s Gwyneth Packrow.
The 37 - year - old program conductor of This Morning had gone to the Insagram to announce that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones's professional Den in anger for leaving a successful advertising union during the last time - to supervise his new union with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones "was upset when this TV girl admitted at a tough Tuesday meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new union - has a cost of £1.5 million - she had no time to manage a Truly business selling clothing and other items.
This business had been compared to the Goop trade class Gwyneth Paltrow and was assured that it would obtain an additional £11 million property for Willoughby.
When Willoughby, 37 - year - old Willagram, went to the Insagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and left Britain for his next vacation home.
The source said: "Truly was the most important of Holly’s priorities.
This was his long-term future that would allow him to be employed for decades to come.
His emerging thought left everyone involved in amazement.
No one can believe what is happening on Tuesday, just ahead of time.
There is a warehouse ready to be sold at Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that the departure of the agent of This Morning, one of Britain's most reliable artists, can cost the business millions of dollars because of the high cost of products such as hats and candles and clothing, as well as the delay in establishing a business.
And it could mean the loss of a long - term friendship.
Willoughby mother of three children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been the ship's partner Jones and Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp had begun Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, was crowned in March.
The couples have one vacation at a time, and Jones has a 40 - percent TV news company in Baldwin.
Willoughby is the president of M&S and will replace Ant Mcpartlin as an ITV visitor to the program I'm A Cerebrity.
The source is near Jones that last night "We can't say anything about his business."
It was a big step 'and we loved each other'
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the press for making comments that might be considered "no leadership" and that he was sure of the leader of North Korea.
Why was President Trump so devoted?
Trump spoke in the expression of his obscenities.
"I didn't give anything."
He also said that Kim wanted to be present for the second assembly after their first assembly in Singapore in June which the Trump was described as a major nuclear detonation campaign in North Korea.
But the conference on nuclear disarmament has been closed.
Over three months after the June convention in Singapore, the prime minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a ‘ similar act ’ from the U.S.
Rather, he said, the U.S.
Trump had the greatest hope for the convention.
"We're doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have a very good relationship.
He also said that his efforts to establish a good relationship with Kim had resulted in a successful counterattack, resulting in the release of prisons and the restoration of the U.S.
And she was right for her unusual way of talking about friendship with Kim.
"I'm easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter the court, we have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd that was lost before him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and Earthquakes Ruined Island, and the Holocaust
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign organizations were told that they do not need.
Although more than 10 percent of the people in Lombok had been affected by their environment, no world disaster had been reported, so necessary for international assistance.
"Many times, unfortunately, it seems that she is not asking for help from other countries, and I'm a little difficult, "Sumbung."
While the Save Children is organizing a group to move to Pala, it is not known whether these foreign workers will be allowed to work.
Sutopo, who talks to disaster management, says that Indonesian officials are trying to see how the situation in Palhu looks if international organizations are allowed to provide assistance.
Even though most earthquakes are occurring in Indonesia, the country is not prepared for natural aggression.
Although tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are unusual in some beaches.
The absence of a sire to warn people of a tsunami in Palu, although already missing, must have contributed to the loss of life.
During the rainy season, travel between many of Indonesia’s islands is especially difficult.
Natural disasters make travel extremely difficult.
A hospital ship left at Lombok to heal those affected by the earthquake is heading to Pallu, but it takes at least three days to arrive when the new disaster has occurred.
President Joko Widdo encouraged organizing construction projects in Indonesia as an important part of the election campaign, and he has contributed large sums of money on roads and railways
But economic hardship has affected A Joko’s government for the next year.
Joko too is experiencing problems because of religious strife in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have adopted a form of one religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have left their homes while Christian and Muslim terrorists fight in the streets, using knives, knives, and arrows, and other useless weapons.

The Cromwell photo in Parliament is the last reminder hit by ‘ trying to change history ’
The ban would be a legendary one because of its destruction as well as that of Tabban in the moral and religious practices of England by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Father Crick's views as "foolishness" but also " trying to change history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘ It was inevitable in this controversy about the removal of images so that the story about Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace could not be told.
Taking a picture of the civil wars in England is neither inspired nor invented by Cromwell.
Perhaps this defective Cromwell would be offered as a sacrifice because of what Thomas’s grandfather had done a century ago.
The beautiful Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is evidence of 19th - century views as well as another part of the history of one who is generally believed I should still be admired.
The Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, probably at the end of the 19th century more than today, as a civilist against outside pressure, in his case of the emperor.
Whether I can show the full extent to it means that this age - old dispute is continuing.
The fact is that the clash between the 17th century has changed the development of our world, and Cromwell is a well - known man who is buried in one part of the regions.
What he did as the Lord Guard is also necessary to celebrate and remember."
A Chinese farmer was shot and killed by a pig
One farmer was bitten and killed by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, known by his family's name "Yuan," was found dead in a broken vein, bleeding near a market in Lippanshui in Guizhou, South China Morning Post said of Sunday.
A pigman is planning to kill a vaccine in the pigs at a pighouse on May 30, 2005 in Xinging in Qinghai, China.
She says that she had traveled with her cousin from the area near Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found the door of a nearby pig door open.
He said that in the pig's house there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
Legal research confirmed that a 550 - pound [250 kg] pig killed the farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and twisted," in a chain, referred to by his name "Wu," said, as explained by Guingingling Evening News.
The security images of Yuan are coming into the market at 4.40 on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
An hour later, his body came back to normal.
The swine that killed the man was not of the Yuan or of his cousin.
The store manager told Everyning News that the pigs had been closed was protected from contact with anyone else, while the police had gathered evidence at the site.
The family, as well as the business officials, are having an all - consuming discussion on how to pay for her death.
Even less common, reports of hazardous pigs exist.
In 2016, pigs injured Mother and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely injured.
Ten years ago, 650 pounds [650 kg] of pigs killed a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened the pig.
After a man in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not cruel but that the quality of blood can be like "emotional".

Like children, they are eager to know... they don't want to harm you.
You should show them proper respect, "So - and - so."
The rest of Rosa’s storm will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the US
As foretold, a fierce storm named Rosa evaporates from the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is causing torrential rains in northern Mexico and southwestern U.S.A.
Rosa had 85 mph, 1 Hurricanes, beginning at 5 o'clock on Sunday, and was 2,325 miles [385 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a small tropical area is being developed in the Pacific Ocean and is moving east toward the West Coast in the U.S.A. as Rosa approaches Baja California Monday while the storm is beginning to blow up the northern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 acres of rain in some parts of Mexico Monday.
Later, the cold heat that is close to the cold air may bring much rain to the south west in the days to come.
In the area, from 1 to 4 falls can cause flooding, carrying garbage and erosion in the desert.
The deep snow causes it to reach 2 to 3 degrees per hour, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
An average of 2 to 4 falls in the southwest, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Floods can be caused by worsening weather.
It can be dangerous to travel through the desert because of the tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause small rivers to become large rivers with strong waters and torrential rains resulting in wind and dust.
A nearby cold wind will bring heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
More than half the rain of bees can fall, which can cause wastes and slippery roads
This is the first rain in the region during its rainy season.
A tropical downpour begins to fall on Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the start of Monday, just prior to the heavy rains on Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy downpour of rain will sweep over the Four Corners on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
By October the temperature can rise to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit [- 40 ° C] in the U.S.
At times, this results in tropical changes in the surrounding areas.
There is a fine example of hot flashes in various parts of the US Sunday.
There are about 20 degrees of hotness between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the temperature is also trying to increase.
Many places in Central and East US are expected to see from October and to extend 80 degrees from the South Mountains to other parts of the Far East.
New York City can reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] on Tuesday, which may be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C] more often than in its city.
Our long-term forecast points to the greater possibility of global warming in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen discussions on Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have seen on six television shows Brett Kavanaugh chosen at the Supreme Court to give a fourth testimony to Christine Blasey Ford who accuses him of the sexual abuse that was said to have occurred in the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, the political struggle continues, and the media are rapidly disrupting the day - to - day program on Friday: an article prepared by Sen Arizona FFlake for one week’s trial.
Ford told the Senate Committee that he is sure by 100 percent that Kavanaugh had caught him drunk and tried to remove his clothes from a party in high school.
Kavanaugh, in a typical case, said they had 100 percent conviction that this had not happened.
It seems that more than 20.4 million people like Nielsen predicted Friday had seen this occur.
The company was counting the average for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Some numbers were not present immediately on the specifics that showed the program, including PCS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often has trouble identifying the number of people who watch in the office.
To understand this correctly, it is the growth of those who are in attendance like those at the football match or at the Grand Educational Center.
Fox News Channel, with its TV reporter in full agreement with the choice of Kavanaughled, was more than 5.69 million spectators throughout the hearing day, Nielsen did.
ABC was second and 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, NSNBC 2,89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, reports Nielsen.
The excitement over the end of the story kept rising.
Flake was particularly important during Friday events.
When the central Republic office announced that they would vote for Kavanauugh, they were photographed by CNN cameras and CBS Friday morning exposed by opposers at the time they wanted to take a truck to the assembly of the Justice Committee.
She had been standing her face down for several minutes with shame, at the CNN television station.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is true to the world?
She was told, "You have power, but most women are powerless."
Flake said that the office had made an announcement and said that before the shipment was closed, he would have more to speak at the committee’s meeting.
The Internet and television were immediately present in hours that followed, while the members of the Court had to vote in order to submit to the unanimous decision of the Senate to vote
But Flake said that he would do this if he could fully understand what the FBI has published in an investigation of these chosen ones the following week, which few Democrats encouraged.
Flake agreed briefly with her partner, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After interviewing Coons with several seconds, Flake made her choice.
Flake’s choice was powerful, for it was evident that the Republicans would not have any votes to agree with Kavanauugh without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate cases involving Kavanauugh.

A volcanic eruption in Mexico City
The eruption from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The World Disaster Management Organization warned Mexico against on Saturdays after the volcano again erupted in the crater and sent 183 hours of air and ash to the ground.
The council was concerned with the noise and shaking of the area.
Photos depict a small ashtray that floats through the streets of Mexico City as Xochilco.

Police fight the Catalan Conservative
Six persons were arrested at Barcelona on Saturday to follow the debate between anti - armed policemen and their freedom fighters, and when thousands of people joined in the dispute to celebrate the liberationist Catalonian vote.
A group of winged anti-rid police officers have cast them with eggs and cast them into flour dyes, causing black and dust clouds in the streets that are usually inhabited by tourists.
Violence was also started during the day with the police using their rods to stop the war.
For several hours the independent groups singing "O’wawawawa, no forgiveness" met the rivals shouting, "Keep living in Spain."
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries from the trauma, the local journalists said.
The threat of security still exists in the permissive area after one year from the October 1 election that was deemed unacceptable by Madrid but enjoyed the Catalonian independence movement.
The majority of the voters have chosen to be independent, even those who are opposed to isolation are not to come, especially not to vote.
According to the Catalonian authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the election in the municipality and create a riot.
Pressure groups had set up camps and stayed all Friday night to prevent opposers from taking part in mob action in assisting the worldly police.
The exhibition was continued but was forced to take place in another way.
The 68 - year - old Narcis Termes, an electrician and his wife said that they no longer believed in Catalonia to be free.
"Last year we were in a very good time.
I had seen my parents crying with joy at the chance to vote, but here again we turned," he said.
Even if they were able to achieve a measure of success in the elections of the preceding December, independent states in Catalan have been fighting to begin this year with their well-known officers in the private prisons or prisons to wait for the trial due to allowing for the election and proclaiming their rights.
Joan Puig, 42 - year - old mechanics who recorded the exhibitions on their telephone, said that the conflict was with politicians on every side.
"They are very dangerous," he said.
On Saturday, Orriol Junquiras, one of nine Catalonian leaders who were in prison before being sentenced from the end of the last year, announced that they would share in the votes of members of the Parliament in Europe the next year.
"To compete with them in the election in Europe is one of the best ways to strengthen the work against democracies and suppress others that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men who were arrested having burst into a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
It was not until 1930 BST that the Ballynagard Crescent IV came.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage had occurred at the gates and at the building.
The bow can also be thrown into the car at another time.
Menga's commission defeated the Rings and the Rings 1-0 women against Livingstone.
The first blow from Dolly Menga made Livingstone’s team a success.
Livingston’s elite team surprised the Ringers and made Steven Gerard lose a second to 18 games as manager of the Ibrox library.
Dolly Menga's plight had made the Gary Holt's team equal to the Irish team in the second part.
Gerard’s team will continue to be the winner of the Premier League during this period, and the following Sunday he will meet the largest of the Hearts, followed by eight bells.
Before the games, Ringers will play with Rapid Vienna in the European League on the Fourth.
Livingston, at present, is adding the game that has won to six games, and the director of the Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenty Miler last month.
Livingston’s team miss the opportunity to resist visitors
The Holt team must have been ahead of time before the end of the siege, with their development of the football that creates problems for the Rings team.
Scott Robinson had a chance but was unable to hold it in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithogow had just tried his way to meet Craig Halket’s head ball.
The players were content to let the Ringers play in front of them, knowing that they could harm the visitors with films.
That is how a vital rod came to be in place.
The Ringers team did the wrong and developed physics, and Livingstone’s team had a chance, when Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave each other a ball and found Menga, who touched the ball in the middle of the box and obtained a ring.
At the same time, the Rings’s team found that the soccer team was not easy to get into and that Liam Kelly’s yoke was not a problem.
This went on for the second part, even Alfredo Morelos showed a male as he closed Kelly’s football.
Scott Pittman’s football was tied in with the arms of the Ranger Allan McGregor team and Lithgow had failed to win the prize on Livingstone’s team’s condition.
The footballs regularly enter the Livingston box and have been removed continually, while the two pins were rejected - after errors of Halket, who replaced it, were another error in the use of soccer.
Surprises from Livingstone - According to Another Watchman
Aladar Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A good game is the wonderful results of Livingstone’s team.
To me, they’ve played better, much better than we could have expected in the meantime.
He did not change his sport and his players from time to time won the best team, but he must have respect for the Holts in the way he has helped the team since his arrival.
He had a number of talented athletes.
The captain of the Halkett played a key role in the games, encouraging his well - organized tiers, while Menga kept the Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Rings was not encouraged, however.
He was not satisfied with the good that he had at times received from Gerard.
Their final games had not been the only chance of attempting to squat against the door - to - door band, and it is a surprise to the Ringers team, which is at the center of the history of the controversy.
Erdogan is widely welcomed in Cologne
It was a smile and excitement on Saturday (September 29) when the heads of Turkey and Germany met at the breakfast table in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany — the goal of forming a brotherhood among members of NATO.
They debated such issues as human rights, freedom, and freedom of the press, as well as the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up a new department.
The city is home to the Turks, who live in an remote part of the country.
The police had cited reasons for the protection by preventing a mob of 25,000 people to gather in front of the district, but most of the followers had come close to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan - many of their Kurdi - Kurdigers also made their remarks clear, criticizing Erdogan’s views as well as the German government’s taking him into the country.
The presentation of these two sections shows the division of human ideas in regard to the stranger that some of the German Turks consider himself a hero and a cruel enemy who dominates others.

The HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the worst in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison official had received medical treatment after he had been arrested by a prisoner.
And last October officials of violence were not called into prison to deal with a serious confusion while their employees were subjected to the torture of fines.
A typhoon called Rosa Y threatens to destroy Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and the Flood (Deadlands Can Benefit)
It may not be possible that a storm will strike Arizona, but that is what must be done first on the morning week when Rosa's remaining wind power will cross the Western Desert, giving the threat of flooding.
The International Weather Administration has already issued a follow - up search for the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in southeastern Arizona and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix II, and I am approaching Monday on Monday at a late hour.
The International Weather Administration in Phoenix wrote in the 21et that only ‘ there are ten winds that still have a storm or a cold wind during the Phoenix of 200 degrees since 1950! ’
Katrina (1967) was a violent storm that was about 40 miles across the AZ border.
More recent photos of the World Storm Agency show two to four acres [2 to 4] of rain and a six-degradable rain in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Some parts of the Western Desert, including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin, may be between 1 and 2 acres, with the chance of falling from four degrees to four degrees.
For those who are not in danger of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because it is a drought.
Even when flooding is a major problem, some rain may be beneficial, as Southwest rains face drought.
According to the U.S. Dought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second largest section, the "weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s storm will cause landslides in the Baja California region of Mexico.
Rosa, still in a strong Sunday morning storm and a fierce wind of 85 kilometres per hour, is just 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm attacks the cold waters of the Pacific and causes you to lose your energy.
Therefore, it is expected to fall in Mexico on a storm in the afternoon or late Monday evening.
Some Mexican regions can be heavy, providing a threat of flooding.
"The 3 to 6 degrees of rain is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora, and is possible until 10 acres." Weather.com.
Rosa will look north through Mexico if a storm reaches the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning like a hot breeze, which follows through Arizona and south of Utah by Tuesday nights.
"The major threat expected from Rosa or her remains is heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause more severe floods and more frequent floodings in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountains.

A Trump said that the Kavanauugh' met with, cruelty, anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote of Judge Kavanauugh is a statement against the harsh and terrible acts of the Democratic Party," Trump did at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The Trump said of the Kavanauugh's compliant, anger," of the Democratic Party throughout its chosen period.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Fourth Congress, who strongly and mercilessly denied me by Christine Blasey Ford that they had raped him in their teens a few decades ago.
Ford too witnessed what he said.
Saturday the president said that "Americans have seen the skill and courage" of Kavanauugh that very day.
"Voti convinced Judge Kavanauugh with a vote to confirm one of the most important legal functions of our time, a judge who has a good reputation for helping people," told a group of his followers in West Virginia.
The president mentioned the election of Kavanauugh in which he spoke of the need for a good release for those who follow the Republican Party in the middle election.

Hundreds have been killed by an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, with an increase in the number
More than 384 persons were killed, many of whom were swept along by the waves that landed on the coast, when a great earthquake and tsunami occurred on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities say on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach in the city of Palu Friday when 20 feet [6 m] of tides (318 m) shattered the coast in the evening and washed many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunami was behind a 7.5 - strong earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat began the day, people were still doing their work on the mainland and did not run away immediately, and they were affected," Supot Poko Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster control agency BNPB, said at a convention in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, drawing cars, bridges, houses, and transporting everything out," Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survive, they said.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 locations in Pallu.
Space drawings produced by the Disaster Service showed many homes and shops after damage, broken bridges and damaged by a flood-milled pack.
Earthquakes continue to rock the coast on Saturday.
Several of the quakes occurred in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for the Disability and Procession of Technology (BPPT) also claimed that the force released by the big earthquake Friday was more than 200 atomic bombs that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow harbor, and this has contributed to the spread of the tsunami.
Nugroro has described the destruction as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels have fallen.
The bodies of the victims were found buried under the debris, they said, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 are not known where they were.
Nugroro said that injuries and damage can be large along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Pallu, the area called the Dontitria, near which the quake occurred.
The means of communication "had been fully affected and had little to do with what things are like" from Dontitía, Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 residents there, ” said the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers go to the affected areas.
"It's a problem already, but it can grow," it said.
On Saturday the council was severely criticized for not knowing that a tsunami had occurred in Palu, even though the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In a questionable video distributed on the social media Dad can be heard on the roof of a house shouting warning people on the road to the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later the water wall fell to the shore, carrying houses and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video at that time.
The quake and the tsunami had, in effect, sent an enormous amount of power and resources, leading to the loss of communication and the need for it even for the authorities to coordinate lifesaving activities.
Soldiers have begun sending freight and supplies from Jakarta and other cities, so the authorities, but the survivors still need food and other necessities.
The city’s trunk had been opened to promote relief and to close up until Oct.
President J. Widdo has to go to the rescue center on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia has been over 800.
It’s a lot of fear.
While the World Vision workers from Dontitía have made their way to the city of Palu, where workers live in wooden bags that have been set up in their office’s yard, they have reached the damaged areas on their way, says Mr. Doseba.
She told me she had seen a lot of damaged houses, she said.
It’s so frustrating.
Even when relief agencies began to arrange to provide assistance, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep skills are being forbidden to go to Pam.
According to Indonesian laws, funds, donations, and workers from abroad are to begin travel unless disaster has been declared national.
This has not been the case here.
"It's still a district disaster," says Aulian Arriani, Prophet of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government would say, "CHOW., it is a world disaster," we could ask for help from other countries, but no such information has now been presented."
The second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, friends and relatives of the bereaved were confident that their loved ones would return as never before in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was carried from the toilet.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the debris for two days with her mother’s body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian soccer coach and parachute, had trained two of the missing players at Asian games, which were completed this month in Indonesia.
Among those imprisoned at Roa Roa Hotel were her students, Dad Mandagi added.
"As an adult in parachute, I have my own concerns," he said.
Brother Gendon also relates how, a few hours after news of the fall of Roa Roa Hotel spread to a crowd of players flying through the parachute, he tried to send the radio radio messages to the Palunist, who share in the beach party.
His messages, though, produced only one white mark, instead of two blue symbols.
I think it means that the messages have not yet arrived," he said.
Thieves $26,750 during a day’s auto storage machine in Newport attracters

West: The singer has changed his name to Himself
The composer Kanye West is changing his name to - Ye.
In addition to a change on Twittter Saturday, he wrote: "One is known as Kane West."
West, 41 - year - old, had been known as Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth - year garment, published in June.
This change takes place before it appears on Saturday, when he is expected to produce his new egg called Jandi.
He replaced Ariana Grande at the show which had resolved "the causes of misunderstandings," said the shower.
In addition to being the epitome of his work, West said that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe that he" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'in you,' ' West did it at the beginning of this year, when discussing the title of Big Boy.
"Therefore I am you, I am the same, and we are dead.
It came from Kanye, which means that he alone, to approach Him only as a shadow of our goods, our faults, our confusion, all our own.
It shows us who we are.
It is one of the most popular musicians who change names.
Sean Combos is well - known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year they announced that they loved such loving names as Love and Brother Love.
Related to the old West, JAY-Z, also announced that his name can be named either with a line or without a line.
THE Mexican army has vowed not to use military force against civilians
The leader appointed in Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Observatory, has vowed that he will not use an army to fight the civilians as the nation nears 50 years of the day that many students were killed.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlaterolco Plaza that he would never use soldiers to oppress the Mexicans.
Soldiers shot at students at a peace exhibit on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people during the time the liberation movement had been established in Latin America.
Lopez Observatory has promised to help young Mexicans to pay monthly fees to students and to open up a number of free government universities.
She also said that unemployment and lack of opportunities are making young people more susceptible to organized crime.
The U.S. government will enhance the human - machine budget
While China is developing in the field of automation, the United States has to increase the cost of research in this field, say a merchant and a commercial employer like Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with the Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These have come in many U.S. government branches that have been commissioned to use these machines, when the world has no effective program for AI.
In the meantime, China has introduced this process last year: and it is intended that by the year 2030 it will be in number 1 on the use of divination.
"Commerging research funds can be a good start, since all countries are far behind the U.S., and we need to get more advanced jobs," says Lee.
These supplements can double the odds of success for AI in the U.S., and Lee told CNBC in this week.
Lee, as she has the book "AI Superpoweers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, director of the Sivanation Street Fund that has devoted a large sum of money to the research of a human machine in China, Face+.
In the mid- 1980s, this principal at the University of Carnegie Mellon developed a machine that succeeded in winning the master of Othello and later became the principal of research in Microsoft and the director of the Google branch in China.
Lee was grateful for the introduction of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robots Challenge and wanted to know when the contest would again be to help her identify the following experts.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government prizes, Lee said.
"It's not a Chinese country which takes educated people; but it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other firms have been hireing university professionals to work in parts of AI in recent years.
Lee said that a change in immigration would also help the U.S.
"I think people who have PhD levels of education should be given a certificate allowing them to become American citizens.
China had established her plan to promote the Machines in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China is a source of income in various schools as does the U.S. government and other research agencies, but Chinese education is limited, Lee said.
Early this year the U.S. Security Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to include colleagues in the industry and education, and the White House has announced the establishment of the Secret Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA has announced $2 billion crops in the AI Net.
As far as NSF is concerned, it still spends over $100 million a year on AI research.
When the National Security Commission places $100 million cigarettes on the part of Man - Made Machines each year.
The Macedonians have cast lots to receive public opinion when it is necessary to change the country’s name
This Sunday was set up to decide whether it was necessary to change the name of the country to become a country, the Republic of North Macedonia" which would cause the conflicts that have existed between the United States and Greece and that have been opposing the European Union as a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the district of Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbors has thus been ascribed to the region as a member of the NATO and the EU.
In June the governments agreed to change the name of Macedonia, but the cultural movement has also rejected it as a reproach for the culture and history of the Macedonian nation.
The country’s leader Gjorge Ivanov says that they do not vote on the sheep and that the majority of people's votes have posed the threat that the votes may be less than half the population of the country to be approved.
The mind - sensitive question was: "Do you want to be members of the NATO and the EU in accordance with our relationship with Greece?"
The supporters of this change, such as the President of Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a difficult thing to do but that it is necessary to make the country a member of the EU and NATO, to move out of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote for the future of our world, the future of Macedonian youths to be as free as members of the European Union because this means that all people are living without fear," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is illegal to do so, many legal advisers have concluded that they have agreed with the outcome of a decision in order to create a favorable impression.
This will require two thirds of all legal advisers.
The election Council in the country said that there were no difficulties when they arrived at 1 afternoon.
However, the voters were 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the 2016 voters who registered for votes.
"I came to vote on behalf of my children, we and Europeans," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the country's capital, Skopje.
Macedonian General Zoran Zaev, Zorica and their son, Dushko, voted in Macedonia to change the national name that would open the way for NATO and European Union to Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018
In a parliamentary building in the city of Skopje, 54-year - old Vladimir Kavardkov erects a small tower and builds seats in front of the set - up and which will not pass the election.
"We want to be members of NATO and EU, but we want to enter these organizations with a positive attitude, not by force, said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor, but we have respect."
If they do not want us to be members like Macedonia, we can register membership to such organizations as Russia and China as the EU-Asia.
Professor Zaev said that membership in NATO would increase commerce in Macedonia, which is also the number of people who have less work.
"I hope that many will be prejudiced because more than 80 percent of our citizens love the EU and NATO," said Zaev Bañata.
He said that the choice of "Ya" will be "in the future."
Kauninini, transmitted on Monday by the Macedonian’s Institute for Policy Research, indicated that some 30 to 43 percent of the population will participate in choosing less than the number expected to come.
One TV documentary owner indicated that 57 percent of the people he spoke to would cast the vote on God’s vote.
Some 70 percent of the respondents said they would vote in agreement to change the country’s name.
The best option involves 50 percent voters, including one voter.
The rejection of this idea was the first failure of the European rationalist movement in May of last year.
Consider: The Manchester City athletes, Sergio Aguero, have passed a block behind the Brughton team in order to drink a bar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed the walls behind Brighton’s team where Manchester City won 2 out of 0 on Saturdays at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The Aquarro has acted as more easily than a mere 65 minutes.
In front of the stage, the Argentinean team won a football field for the first time.
He ran with his ball and clasp at the back of three, and then I had a chance to do so.
Araro came in contact with four Brghton players.
He then struck one tier behind the back and ran faster than the other mansions and entered the bunker on the Brughton team.
Then she handed the ball to Sterling, who was to her left.
The English actress responded by throwing the ball back to Aguero, whose right leg exerted itself across the Mathew Ryan to the right side of the canal.
"Aguero is suffering from pain on her feet," Pep Guardio, senior officer of the Machester City team.
"We said she was playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the opportunity to get a crown at the time.
It was Sterling, however, who made the team an advantage of the cup - taking contest.
His burden came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a football in Brughton's soccer field.
Then she gave Leroy Sane to the right side of the stadium.
Sane played the ball several times and gave it to Serling to lead the ball into the bag.
Sterling simply pushed the ball into the net just before it fell to the border.
The Manchester City team is playing with the Hoffenheim team in the European Campions League in a team at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Sinheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants special games with Rockies
When the Nationals team was released in the desert field, there was no need to set up other games.
On the other hand, cheerer Schcherzer wants him to play God with the Colorado Rockies team, except for a program to have the results in the Rockies, leading to the Los Angeles Dodgers on NL West.
The Rockies team won 5-2 on their game and Nationals on Friday night, but they are still eager to win their first cup of tea.
"Even there is nothing to be found in the drama, but we will go into the theater to know that the Denver crowd and the team will give us the largest games I can play this year.
So why don't I want to play such games?
The Nationals did not announce who would start Sunday, but they were apparently thinking of producing Scherzer to play the game in the first place.
Schcherzer, who will be a 34 - year - old, has made plans to play a four - minute baseball game and has had enough rest on Sunday.
The Washngton Yuy has 18-7 players in the 2.53 ERA and played a soccer game 300 times in 220 stages in this size.
Trump conventions in West Virginia
The president mentioned the election of Kavanauugh in which he spoke of the need for a good release for those who follow the Republican Party in the middle election.
All we have done is threatened in November.
It will be five weeks before one of the most important choices in our time will take place.
This is one of the largest, big -- I’m not running but fast for the reason why I’m everywhere to fight the best choices," she said.
Trump went on to say, "You see an awesome, fearsome Democrat movement, you see happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means are needed, seeing the difficulties, the pain.
He does not care about the victims, who have to cross to gain strength and correction, what they need only with power and correction, and we do not give them up.
The Democrats, he said, purposely "reject and ban."
"You have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "resent but cruel and fearful but not true."
He also named the leader of the Senate’s Committee, Dianne Feinstein in the Democrat, which was adopted by a term of contempt from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you produce the document?
Oh, no.
No, waiting for one — it was a very difficult body language - the extremely complex lingua franca I have ever seen."
The bobour is no longer a large congregation.
He does not let anyone know what he is trying to say
When the promoters of the Momentum party in my party decided to criticize me, it was not surprising.
Besides, I'm the last one among the MP of Labor to be told that we're not accepted-assisted because we have spoken our heart.
Joan Ryan’s legal friend had been treated similarly because he had opposed religion.
To me, the examiner had reproved me for not keeping company with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the need for reliable financial policies, the security of the world, in Europe, matters that Jeremy did not agree with the leaders of the past.
The knowledge of the convention Nottingham East Labor Friday Saturday "We want the meetings to be an interchange of the mind and to benefit others.
For eight years, my position as a social discoverer was the same.
Sadly today, it has not been held that many meetings were held and that the promise to deal with politics in a "good, mild" way has already been forgotten and, if this is done, has already happened.
It is also evident that differing views are not allowed in the Labor and paleon indeed on which it is a requirementable to the Party underside.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as did my supposed political associates who expected me to change and live in areas where I did not agree with the security of the country or the EU.
Every time I speak freely - it doesn't have anything to say — I follow the social pressure that he wants me to be chosen, to criticize the local politics, to tell me not to be a member of the Labor Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
Of course, I know I have the privilege of being more than some of my friends, such as the comments that dealt with me out of politics.
I am impressed by the skills and devotion that I observe among my friends who daily experience injustice or prejudice but who are not ashamed of their dignity.
One of the most disturbing features of our political era is how cruel the news of cruelty is seen to be.
Last Saturday Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labor Party should follow a caring tradition.
The fact is that we are no longer a larger congregation and with any ‘ lack of confidence ’ or a change of law is reduced.
I have had a lot of technology during the past two years when I am encouraged to throw my head down, not to speak too much, and I will become a "good person."
But that was not the reason for my involvement in politics.
Since the surrender of the Labor Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, when I was annoyed by the government’s refusal to leave my entire class to go to high school, I have tried to encourage good works for those who are interested in them, whether they are a court official or a government official.
I have never hidden my political goals, including my previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my points and issues that I did not agree with this new leadership.
For all of them, I would say, when this world enters Brexit that will harm families, businesses and government services, I don't understand my purpose to spend time and energy in being faithful to the leader of the Labor Party.
But the message I have is not from Nottingham Momentum, which is about the area I’m in, whether it’s Achour or not: I’m proud to serve you and promise you that no threat to vote or political elections can interfere with what I believe is necessary for you all.
Chris Leslie and MD of Nottingham East.
Ayber 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr’s undamaged Ayr’s ever - present peak
The final two steps have changed the outcome of the show, but it is not surprising that Ayr has to excel at winning the fascinating Ligi of Tennets.
Ayr is above, and only the group has never collapsed in ten history.
Finally, it was a good game for the players behind the back of the football, and it had a good effect on the soccer team because the players took less and more aggressive opportunities to make it to the heart of the football instructor Peter Murchie.
"We’ve had a difficult history, but we’ve never given up, so I'm supposed to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie a Melrose said: "To get to the Ayr team, they made better use of their opportunities than we did."
The 14 - minute offer that Grant Anderson had been given was adopted by Fazier Cli, who led the Ayr team, but the adoption of a yellow letter to Roy Hughes of Scotland, led to the reduction of Melrose’s team through Jason Baggot.
Cli added the Ayr team’s links through penote and also destroyed the first section before the Ayr team moved by 17 to 5.
However, Melrose’s team set a fine start in the second phase, and its discovery was put to good use by the Baggot, who ruthlessly beat the cane to make it as much as 5 different.
Later, the stage was set for Ruaridedh Knott, who was carried around the labyrinth, when the Ayr reawaki added the bellies to the Culli that had been destroyed by the Stafford McDowall project.
A team member of the Ayr team, Blair Macpharson, also received a yellow certificate and was released, and Melrose took advantage of the increase and tried to shoot Bruce Colvine, under pressure from the Ayr team.
The gang at their door closed up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received his yellow certificate to fall to Celi without a ball, on the line of a penot, MacPerson was shot in the Ayr team.
Cli gave it a bad impression on both sides when Kyle Rowe played ball in a box so that Gregory Henry’s team could win the fifth.
A professional artist at Still Game is expected to establish a new job in the food industry
A professional artist at Still Game Ford Kieran is expected to establish a new job in host companies when it became known that he was appointed to be the leader of a food - producing company with a license.
Jack Jarvis, a 56 - year - old man, is playing on a BBC show that he is playing with a long - term comical friend Greg Hempil.
The two had announced that the ninth session is coming and the last one at the exhibition, and it is evident that Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.

Our Sea is our: Bolivia, a country far from the sea, hoping that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors watch over the military headquarters in La Paz.
Governments raise the blue flag.
The sea currents from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the words: ‘ The sea is ours freely.
It is our responsibility.
In all of Bolivia’s far - off waters, the memory of the shores that Chile has lost during the 20th century is still well - known as the desire to repat into the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have been much greater for decades now, while Bolivia waits for an international court hearing on October 1, five years later.
" Bolivia has power, a spirit of cooperation and peace, and has great hope and confidence for the results," says Roberto Calzadilla, prime minister of Bolivia.
Many of Bolivia’s citizens will observe the ICJ decision at the country’s largest exhibitions, and I believe that the Hague court will support what Bolivia - based discussions have been called for after many years in Chile to discuss in order to provide Bolivia for a sea voyage.
Evo Morales, the well - known president of Bolivia, faces a difficult battle of reelection for the next year and a great deal of hopes on the Monday decision.
"We're about to return to the Pacific Ocean," which he promised at the end of August.
Some experts believe, however, that the court will not determine for the sake of Bolivia - and the least might change if it is done.
The UN from the Netherlands has no authority to hand over Chile, and it says that they do not know the consequences of all the discussions.
That the ICJ will come only six months after the last cases were heard indicates that the case was "not serious, ” said Paz Zárate, a civil specialist in Chile.
Besides promoting Bolivia’s goal, the past four years may have restored the land.
"The subject of reaching the sea has been adopted by the Bolivian authorities here," said Zárate.
Morales ’ cruel speech has destroyed all the good that remained in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to have casual conversations, but the results are even more challenging.
Since 1962, no two states have been closer to each other.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, denied the idea that these measures were acting with amazing urgency.
Monday will bring Bolivia "the best opportunity to have a new relationship with Chile" and the opportunity to " resolve 139 years of misunderstandings and meaningful relationship," she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America used sea affairs as a political way.
" Bolivia will not leave her freedom to go to the Pacific," she added.
"This decision is an opportunity to deal with the past."
North Korea believe that it will not destroy nuclear weapons unless it is believed in the U.S.
The President of North Korea Ri Yong says that their country will not destroy their nuclear weapons for the first time if they cannot believe Washington.
This is what is said on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfill the vow that they had made at the Singapore convention among the leaders.
His statement comes after the U.S. Serretry of State Mike Pompeii seems to be close to reevaluating nuclear debates that went wrong for three months at the Singapore conference with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
U is said to be a ‘ dream ’ that continuing economic sanctions and the US denial of the end of the war in Korea would cause North to fall.
Washington does not want that announcement before Pyonging.
Both President Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to attend the second meeting.
But there is general doubt that Pyong can be determined to give up weapons that the country considers the only way to safety.
Pompey was planning to make his trip to Pyong the next month to prepare for the second convention between Kim and Trump.
The fashion parade in Paris reveals a few recent hats on the way to High Street near you
If you want to have different hats or close to the sun, do not look anywhere else.
Valentino and Thom Browne unearthed several large SS19 hats on the street that impressed and amazed those who had other fashions at the Paris Faxion Week.
Unscrupulous hats were sent to Instagram during the past summer and have brought their beautiful creatures into the street.
Valentino’s shining hat was so high and large that it was decorated with feathers that filled the heads of the showers.
The larger ones include the more durable ones, such as scaffolding, undergarment, and condensation.
Thom Browne also revealed a variety of unique masks, and during the celebration of Halloween.
Many beautiful masks had been lost in lips and were much like Hannibal Lecter more than the uute couture.
One creature looks like a water bather filled with holes and glass, while another looks like a magble of ice cream.
And if you continue to talk about these fashions, you will have a chance.
Fashion management predicts that large binoculars may be able to travel to the main streets near you.
The large hats are well visible along with the shoes of La Bombay, a two-foot grass hat that has been visible to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A religious sign behind an imaginary helmet that spread over the social Media sent a larger creature to a beach market made of about the size of a giant swimmer.
La Rivira SS19 in the Paris Fax Week was a beautiful white - haired, brown - black coat.
The famous style writer Luke Artamiage told FEMAIL: 'I hope to see the large hats and bags of the sea arrive on the upper road during the summer - as a designer may have been very sensitive to the need for major products.'
John Edward: The ability to speak different languages is a requirement for all peoples of the world
The so - called independent schools in Scotland have gained a reputation for education, and this has continued in 2018 and other good results of experiment, which have only been encouraged and built up in sports, art, music, and so forth.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), endeavor to provide the best help for their children and parents.
Such private schools do their best to equip their students for further education, their chosen career, and their position as citizens of the world.
As a field of education that is able to form and set up a formal school education, we see modern languages continuing as the most desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela observed: “When you speak to Dad in his language, the language he learns will go to his head.
If you speak to him in his language that touches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English for friendship and mutual trust.
From the recent trials of this year, we can see that languages are being studied by more people and more highly successful in private schools.
About 68 percent of the students who had learned foreign languages did much well and experienced the special results of the class A.
Most of these, gathered in 74 schools of SCIS, indicated that 72 percent of students were able to get the high results of the Mandarin class, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent of the Spanish students also received the results A.
This indicates that Scotland’s private schools are contributing to the development of foreign - language education as the necessary skills that children and youths will no doubt want in the future.
Languages now, as a subject of choice, are being done similarly in the course of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons their employers have been struggling to find potential employees, 17 percent say they lack the ability to speak languages.
Language ability is therefore essential to prepare youths for future responsibilities.
Since much of the work is open to them with linguistic skills, these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of a person’s choice of employment, learning a second language is an excellent way of life.
Being able to communicate with those of another race or culture puts a limit on the spiritual growth of the person of many languages.
According to your Gov survey of the over 4,000 adult UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak foreign languages in order to communicate effectively and to speak only two percent of the number being spoken in French, 15 percent.
That is why spending money on a language - educational program is now necessary for today’s children.
Having several languages, especially those of developing lands, will help children to get a good job.
In Scotland each school has its own language.
A number of schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages that seem to be important in the UK to prepare for the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages you can choose from private schools and teach professionals in these fields.
The National Schools in Scottish are devoted to developing learning methods in which they can prepare children and equip them with skills that may be needed to succeed, even for any future possibilities.
It can still be seen, in the global business, that languages continue to be important in the future of this world, and why this must be proved in education.
Of course, modern languages must be considered a "international technology."
The election of private schools continues to be open, and more and more Scots are taking place.
Il setting aside more than two dollars (U.S.).

Just how much time he spends is not known.
"There are more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers Web site.

Trump convention in West Virginia, You Tube Chanel
The president of the Watch Tower Society, Donald Trump, has initiated an all - night meeting at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is one of the five determinations of Trump for the morning, including standing meetings instead of the areas of Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the election of a man who had appointed him to be a judge was stopped at the Supreme Court, Trump would like to present the people to a central election during his reign when his Republican party was threatened by a stately election in November.
What is the occasion, and how would you describe it on the Internet?
The Trump meeting is held at seven o’clock in the evening, Saturday evening, September 29, 2018.
You can also visit the Web site www.jw.org.
Trump should address the cases of Brett Kavanaugh who were appointed to serve as judges in the Supreme Court, which provoked anger because it involved that the Kavanaughs are thought to be raped when the vote for his conviction is stopped for a week now while the FBI does research.
However, the main purpose of these short conventions is to help the Republican Community to benefit from the November festivals.
Thus, the purpose of the five Trump meetings is "to encourage our supporters and the people who want the best when the Republican party wants to protect and increase the number of counselors in the municipality," according to the Reuters newspaper.
"The presence of more counselors is an important factor that has prompted presidents to hold these conventions in many places as we go for the occasion of public meetings," one of the organizers to select Trump who did not want to be mentioned in the newspaper Reuters.
The convention at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling can invite delegates from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be broadcast by Pittsburgh, ” according to the West Virginia Metro newspaper.
Saturday will be the second time of the last month of Trump in the suburbs of Virginia, where he won 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the representative of the Republic of West Virginia a while Patrick Morrisey and the rest of the flock.
"Help for goats and presidents does not give a good picture to Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters reports.
2018 Yyder cup cup: UASA’s team has shown a hero’s ability to keep up with Sunday games as soon as they come
After three plays, a weekend of four characters can become a fair that would suit the Ruder’s cup.
Changes in entertainment, though, are just as inevitable in a game as any number of players believe in such events.
Who, then, are available for that purpose?
"They led 6 percent, but now there are only 4, so we do this as a chance," said Jordan Spieth as they walk slowly.
The European team now has the opportunity to conduct 4 percent of the remaining 12 games.
The American team, says Spieth, feels that they have much to offer, such as the success of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together for a whole day and found three out of four notes.
He is a good example for us.
As he and Thomas remained so loud the sound of the ball they had hit into the pit, so that history would be equal to four four to four notes.
His hurling the ball into the pit over the 15th pit and the same screams were repeated, which shows his belief that the American band had not completely defeated.
"One should only wear the strength and think about your games," said Spieth.
This is what all participants have here.
Only 18 followed.
The players who have more records than Spieth and Thomas during these two days are Gracesco Milinari and Tommy Fletwood, which are still missing in the Ruder cup.
Two European players have won four fourths and are flawless.
The "Moliwood" was a team of two players alone who didn't catch a ball near the crater on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last 9 channels.
This, along with the support and encouragement of the circus, shows that they are the most hard - to - win players on Sunday, and no players in Europe can overrun the Fleetwood or Molinari following the sun’s entry to Le Golf National.
They may even have been in different valleys.
It is still easy to say that a European band has taken a cup, so far.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated Sergio Garcia, who was a team with Alex Norman at four football games in the morning.
The thrust of the ball into a nearby pit and the first nine footballs led their team to such an extent that the Spanish and Seeden could not get back.
But Sunday has no limit to his success.
Four football games and four other players are so enjoyable to watch as a result of the two - person communication, the advice given, the guidance not given and the means to play.
In the meantime, a team of team team members in Europe has become the top team and are on their way to a final show, and four games have shown that the American team, particularly the United States, has the highest potential.
The European team leads 10-6 percent on the last day of the Ruder Cup
The European team will have the privilege of playing the final game in the Ruder cup after winning the American team for four football games on Saturdays and 10-6 percent.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a team that suffered so much at the hands of Tiger Woods, their winnings at the Golf National Show showing had reached four.
A European team, taught by Thomas Bjorn, was about to take a cup that had been refused to protect it for the last two years at the Hazel Stadium, forcing the American team on their four - day soccer game listings to 31.
The U.S. soccer team was more determined than two football players, but it was no match for the winner.
The team taught by Jim Furryk needs 8 percent of the 12 hours each Sunday to win a cup.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four players in the game and by their good play at the end of the weekend, he and Molinari love either "Milliwood" and the second player two more than the first four players in the history of the Ryder cup.
After winning the four - ball games Woods and Patrick Reed, he also won the first victory over Woods and Bruson Dechambeau to compete in the American soccer team with 5 and 4 winnings.
Woods, who tried to escape on two Saturdays, displayed a man several times but has now won 19 games of 29 football games with four players as well as seven successive games.
Justin Rose, who was released from four football games the next morning, organized a team of two men with Henrik Stenson on a four - man show and won 2 - and 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka at the time.
On a cold winter day in the south of Paris, the European team did not cross it clean.
The three - time winner of Justin Thomas led the American team and two other Saturdays.
These won 2-and 1 percent above Jon-Rahm and Ian Poulter of the Spanish team in four football competitions and also defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4 and 3 in the contest of four people even though they had won their first two games.
In the history of Ryder’s cup alone, the remainder of a team and four notes in the play of alone were successful, even though the Furryk security team is just as strong as the other band to hold a cup.
After a second team is doing well for two days, the highest performance on the Sunday seems to be much more difficult.
North Korea has ‘ no reason to stop using it without confidence. ’
On Saturday, North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that continuing to hide them adds to their distrust of the American government and that there was no reason for his country to give up the use of nuclear weapons alone during the period.
Ri Yong Ho spoke at the annual conference that North Korea had done things such as a ‘ defeat strategy ’ during the past year, such as giving up nuclear weapons and explosives, breaking down the nuclear building and promising that they would no longer increase their nuclear weapons.
"But we didn't see America doing the same things again," he said.
"Unless we believe the United States we will not be satisfied with the security of our country and in these things it is impossible for us to give up the use of nuclear weapons alone.
Even U.R. repeats a North Korean national complaint against refusing to give up the use of nuclear weapons in the United States where North Korea is to be praised for its great success in this matter, his words were very effective because his country did not merely refuse to give up the use of nuclear weapons as Pyongang did in the past.
A Ri referred to a message written by Kim Jong Un and the Trump on the first turn of the American and North Korean presidents in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try "rejecting nuclear weapons in Korea" and the Trump stressed safety in North Korea.
North Korea had been trying to end the war between North Korea and South Korea, but North Korea had been forced to give up the use of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
The U.S. government has been unwillinging to limit the severe sentences of North Korea.
"The United States is still holding "the first time to give up the use of nuclear weapons" and has been increasing the anti-governmental methods of North Korea to attack North Korea, and America has been refusing again to ‘ predict the end of war," said R.
"The idea that discipline can force us is just a dream of people who don't know us well.
But the problem is that we are not going to be affected.
U.S. president Kim and Trump, who made the opening remarks of a United Nations conference on that weekend.
Instead, the minister spoke of these conflicts for Kim and South Korea’s president of the Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If it were the case between us and South Korea, it would not have come to such a degree of disreputable work on the Korean island.."
Even so, Ri's language was different from that of the previous year when he spoke to a U.N. when he told them that it was easy when "European President" Trump called Kim' to an empty space.
This year at the United Nations General Assembly, the Trump, who last year threatened to ‘ totally destroy ’ North Korea, praised Kim for the first act of denouncing the nuclear war, but said that a major project was to be carried out and that North Korea’s punishments were still to be used to stop the practice.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set a time limit, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia called for the UN Security Committee to recognize North Korea for its initiative.
However, the U.S. President Mike Pompeii told the Fourth National Security Committee: "Declarations from the National Security Committee in North Korea should have continued and will not fail to see that the country has completely stopped using these weapons."
This committee has been extending its boundaries since 2006 to prevent the banking of North Korea from miscalculations in nuclear and other delivery systems.
At the conclusion of the UN General Assembly, he said that he would go to North Korea the following month to repair the second location of Trump and Kim.
Pompey has traveled to Norht Korea three times this year, but the final leg of his trip was still in bad shape.
They left North Korea saying that the discussions went well but a few hours later the North Korean country disagreed with him, saying that he was offering a "tuberculate arguments."
North Korea promised to meet the Mooons this month to depose a nuclear firm and a security firm like the U.S.
He said that Kim told them that the ‘ same things he wanted" was a guarantee of security that the Trump promised in Singapore and the ways to establish a relationship with the United States.
Harvard University students learn a healthful course on sleep
The new study at Harvard University, which began this year, has made it possible for college students to get enough sleep in order to stop the study all night with drugs.
One scholar noted that high school students in this world do not have the basics and skills to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Mother’s Hospital, considered the study to be the first of America’s history.
He encouraged the study to get started after teaching what can be done with self - denial.
'When I finished school one girl found me and said: 'Why am I told this in my last year?'
She said that no one told me the importance of sleep - which surprised me, she told the Telegraph newspaper.
The first study of this year will explain the basics for healthy sleep, both education and play, as well as benefits to the health of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Head of the Medical Association, said that the university decided to start a study after discovering that most students do not sleep during the week.
This one - hour discussion focuses on different kinds of communication.
In one section there is a picture of a hotel room, where students need a cup of coffee, cartons, teachers, and books to tell them about the dangers of sleep and light, and how doing good in sports is disturbed by lack of sleep, as well as the need for proper sleep.
On the other hand, students are told that sleep deprivation often places high risk of heart disease, depression, and cancer.
A board consisting of pictograms was created to encourage students to focus on the day - to - day activities of the school.
'We know it does not change the behavior of the students there.
But we believe they have the right to know where you have the right to know about the dangers of smoking, said Professor Czeisler.
The pride of learning ‘ and studying all night, ’ he said, adding that new skills and academicism add to the students' sleeplessness.
To make sure that you get enough sleep, as well as the best way to be a ‘ secret weapon ’ for students to deal with frustration, fatigue, and anxiety, he should also avoid weight gain, for lack of sleep makes the brain hungry from time to time.
Raymond So, a 19- year- old California medical student who is studying in health science, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the study because he learned one of the lessons taught by this professor in his first year at Harvard University.
He said that the study opened his eyes and encouraged him to encourage the professor to make a personal study at the university.
As a result, he wants all high school students to have a similar education before they start their studies at the university.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students set a time limit for their sleep, and they should be aware of the dark side of the light coming from the telephone, the optical light, and the electrical lights that cause sleep loss.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranges: Menga’s thug led the Gerard group to surrender
The Ringers ’ team also gave way to the retreating of Dolly Menga’s bingo, a seemingly incompetent group of Gerard, led to a death of 1-0 in front of the Livingstone team.
The Brobx team appears to have passed the first march since February when it won 41 women in front of the St Johnstone team, but a team trained by Gary Holt defeated the Gerard team to give Gerard second victory in 18 games since the practice of soccer causes us to have eight units left above the Hearts.
Menga was burned seven minutes before the first section, and the Rings, which is lacking in encouragement, is not seen until it was able to recover.
When the Rings team falls on the past six to six, Livingstone’s team has risen to the third and is just behind Hibernianian.
There may also be other problems with the Ringers when a Clum Spence player was aided by head injuries accompanied by an object thought to be thrown from the latter side.
Gerard turned eight athletes who defeated the Ayr team to arrive at the mouth of the Betred cup.
When Holt did not change the role of athletes who played and competed with Hearts for the weekend and must have been delighted with the team’s giving the Ringings.
The Rings team was the main promoter of the soccer team, but Livingstone’s team was responsible for the burning and burning of the ball.
And it had to be dried in the first two minutes when Menga gave a fine ball to Scott Pittman to play in the barn where Allan McGregor, but the contestants fought his ball right alongside it.
The movie team he played with Keshon Jacobs found Craig Halket, but Alan Lithogow, who held on to the back with Craig Halkett.
The Ringers team showed a little bit of optimism but seemed to have little confidence, especially when they got to the corner.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should be given a 15 - minute recording when he met with Steven Lawles but was rejected by the accomplished performers in Colombia.
The Ringers ’ team was able to fight only twice in the distance, but the old Ringings of the Rings, Liam Kelly, had no problem with soccer from Lasssana Coubally and Obie Ejaria.
When the stake received at 34 minutes of Livingstone’s team was against the performance of the games, no one can deny that the tiger was supposed to have a mission.
The Rings also failed to remove the ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not turn the ball away when Declan Gallagher gave a ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly played and gave it to a badly spoiled Menga.
Gerard showed his discontent with the Ringers when he pulled out Coubally and introduced Ryan Kent and was able to produce good fruit with urgency when the players gave it to Morelos but Kelly, who played the top team, ran away from the ball.
But Livingstone’s team forced the Ringers to play their favorite soccer team, and Lithgow and Halket put off long - distance soccer.
The Holt team could add its burdens to the end of the game, but McGregor carefully closed Jacobs before Lithgow’s soccer team was finished.
The Ringers, Glenn Middleton, who came out from the theater, cried out for a pen, not against Jacobs, but against Thomson, the orchestra.
Almanac: Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sonday Morning" Almaanac: September 30, 1822, 136 years ago, and SURGING ... the day on which the future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of identifying and testing the force released in the atom, which eventually made it the Geiger Counterer.
If the major scientific instrument since then, the Geiger Counseler has become a well - known weapon, such as in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado," as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans seem to be the most unreliable scientists:
Brother: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Counseler tool, which is used to obtain energy, such as uranium.
If you have these microphones on your head, you can sense the effects of the force released by the atom.
Evans: "True, this is amazing!"
He died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
Yet, the products are still there.
A new vaccine for cancer may help the immune system to detect dangerous cells
This new vaccine for cancer may help the immune system to ‘ recognize and kill dangerous cells
The vaccine has helped the immune system to identify dangerous cells as one of the means of treating the disease.
This method involves releasing body cells from a patient, converting them into a laboratory
Then they can see the protein that is found in too many cancers and then give her injections
A simple vaccine offers hope for the metabolic rate of various cancers.
One woman helped by this vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect dangerous cells, had seen her prostate cancer go away for more than 18 months.
This method involves releasing body cells from a patient, changing them from a laboratory so that they can "see" the most common protein of cancer called heR2, and restore the cells to the body.
Professor Jay Berezofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show we have a vaccine to help us.."
HER2 is "compliant to a number of types of cancers, "including breast, cervical, lung and colon cancers, Prof Berezofsky explained.
The same method of detoxification and "training" to treat cancer is also effective in treating a type of blood cancer.
After appearing at the SNL, the West launched the Trump’s Golden Compass, wearing a hat inscribed on the New World Power.
The Long Road to Recovery
Even West was criticized in the radio on Saturday Light Live after the drama he gave thanks to the U.S. President and said that Donald Trump would win the election of 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town that same night, wearing a hat inscribed on the World’s Allies, he made a malicious statement to the Democrat party and repeated that they support Trump.
"I often speak with a white man and say: "How would you like the Trump, and the prejudiced?"
So if I had been concerned about prejudice, I would have left America long ago, she said.
SNL started the exhibition with Matt Damon, whereas Hollywood’s actor had challenged the evidence of Brett Kavanauugh before the Senate Committee on the subject of Christine Blasey Ford of rape.
Although not published, West comments were sent to a social networking site by the comical Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock tries to ridicule the West and what he has lost on the Internet.
On the other hand, West complained to the audience that he had suffered a lot because of his hat in the back of the stage.
"They beat me on the back of the site.
They said, 'Just inside it is the hat.'
They persecuted me!
Then it is said that I am in a perishing state," according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: "Do you want to see a lost place?" saying "He’ll wear my hero's hat, because it means that you won't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to improve?
Strive to show love.
His remarks were both jeered by the audience and the SNL members seem embarrassed, Variety wrote this, and one person then says: "All the radio was silent."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the singer Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West has surprised many when they sing I Lovet, wearing the Perrier Crate.
West was helped by the head of the TPUSA, Canadian Turner, who wrote on Tweeter: "To one of the most courageous: THE PRIORITIES OF THE People's PRIORITIES."
But interviewer Karen Hunter sent a message to Twitter that West was ‘ just what he is and it's very interesting.

A movie actor of Thrones Kit Hartton is upset by the disturbing thoughts about masculinity
Kit Hartton, known for his shooting with a knife like Jon Snow in a HBO drama.
But this 31 - year - old actress, challenged the notion of heroism, saying that such responsibilities on the harp mean that young boys often feel they have to be mature enough to be respected.

Kit believes that a television producer may be one contributing factor in the increase in this behavior, but we are grateful for the fine conduct of some male role players.
He went on to say: ‘ What are humans born, and what are they taught?
What is taught in the television screen, and in the environment that makes young men feel that they must be male?

Some 820,000 people have the virus in the country, health.
Only the second half of the population attended was the combined attendance of some 40,000.
Many of these people were infected through sexual intercourse that brought about changes in their lives.

However, the number of HIV infections has been drastically reduced, said Chinese health workers at a conference in the Yunnan region.
Each year the number of people infected with HIV has climbed to some 100,000.
The transmission of the Hiv virus through sexual intercourse has increased greatly in homosexual relationships.
The laws against homosexual relations in China were abolished in 1997, but the discrimination against these relationships is widespread in the country.
In view of the country’s traditional climate, surveys indicate that between 70 percent and 90 percent of men who engage in sexual intercourse eventually marry women.
The most widespread spread of the virus in these relationships is the result of unprotected sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to treat the HIV virus in an attempt to combat the virus.
A Maxine Waters denied that the employee was the one who produced a message about a security adviser for the Republican Party, and he said that this was a ‘ big lie ’ as well as a ‘ guesswork.
A U.S. ambassador to the U.S.
The Waters of Los Angeles, members of the Democrat Democrat, said that the article is published by the "people and pages" of the Internet that tend to be damaging to people's reputation.
"This is a real lie, a very bad lie," Waters said in a Twittter message.
The release contained the addresses and phone numbers of American counselors, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hach, from Utah.
The text was found on the fourth page of Capitol Hill after the trial of an anonymous lawyer named Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to appear before the Supreme Court.
The message was released when the three counselors interviewed Kavanaugh.
The social network of the Conservative groups such as the Gateway Putit and RedState also said that an IP address that identifies the source of the site was connected with Waters office" and published much about the Waters worker, reports Hill.
"This empty story is a complete lie," Waters said.
"Workers at my Oyu-named office and its confidential message and security have been placed on a donkey because of the very term he did not publish the message.
This worthless news is a complete lie.
Waters ’ comments have been criticized by a number of people on the Internet, including the former White House Author of the Ari Fleischer.
"Communication is an expression of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that he is not qualified to be a Law Counselor.
If someone has been lied to, there is no need to feel angry.
They should not abuse authority.
Do not be envious of those doing what is bad.
He must be calm and calm.

"We will make sure that the people who publish these articles are known," he continued, "and they are judged according to the rules on these cases because they are dangerous and disturbing to anyone working in my office."
The coating of Johnny English Strikes Again - Atkinson’s unimpressed Atkinson’s art
It is known now that it is a good idea to absorb the benefits of the British Development of the European Union in one of Britain's national movies and that it is also seen in the events of Jonny English film that began in 2003 by Jonny English film and was replayed in 2011 by the back of Jonny English Reborn.
Would a casual, critical comment on this matter indicate the danger of developing a world of commerce?
At any rate, Johnny, with large and bright eyes, had the ability to perform the second and second creative feat — indicating that he had the potential for making a full - language film that reached many people.
He is the ideal candidate for a few role models — someone who pretends to be a policeman, a policeman, and a British member of the Charters of Fire for the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The article is based on Atkinson’s journey in an old business show on Barclay’s television network, which brought rice.
There is a pleasant setting for the fairy - tale Mr. Johnny English.
I was impressed by Johnny English when he followed an old safety machine and a gun hanging over his shoulder.
Atkinson's sense of humor is evident, but his sense of humor is not so profound but, too subtle as well as a "declaration" because of seeing that the 007 films and Mission Impossible have a very good sense of humor.
His sense of humor appears to have been designed for children rather than adults, and to me Johnny’s visits are less artistic and more steady than Atkinson’s films that he does not speak and were like Bean.
At the beginning of this article shows that Britain is in serious trouble.
Some computer operators entered the British national computer screens and produced a message for the British soldiers who were in various parts of the world, which confused a soldier from a small area of Kevin Eldon's film.
It is the last thing of a leading prime minister who is self-consuming and suffering, who sees the problems of his political background: Emma Thompson is playing on the side of a show like Teresa May but in the drama has nothing to do with it.
His wise counselors suggest that in view of the frustrated wages of each employee, he should get rid of the other person’s work.
And this means Johnny English, former high school principal, who teaches about the practice of a secret soldier: popes have good things, while English teaches children a variety of techniques.
English has been unexpectedly taken to the Whitehal convention for news of an unexpected event and has met a longtime colleague, Bough, who was also taken by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, married to a naval officer, a part of the burly bravado referred to by Vicki Pepperine.
Thus Batman and Robin of the Great Emperor have also been involved, who have met the son of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletinova.
Now the prime minister is disturbed by the activities of a wealthy man who was supposed to solve the problems of the British computer: Jason Volta, taken by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough set up their task: by pretending to be food suppliers at a restaurant, they set fire to the French dining room; this led to the riot of the Volta train; and English caused confusion when they wanted to use sound equipment to see what was inside the Volta.
All last things are happening in the final section, but its appeal and presentation shows that it is a movie for children in all directions.
A little fun.
As was the case with Johnny’s English film, I could not think of it: Would a British movie take a role for Rowan Atikson to explore his art?
The Labor Organization denies that the British will work for four days on a week but to be paid for five days ’ wages
The Jeremy Corbyn team has had a big idea that they see the British working four days on the weekend but to be paid five days ’ wages.
It is said that the company needs to give workers the extra income they have earned by using them as a day of rest.
The supervisor’s decision will allow workers to have three days of rest but to receive the same pay.
According to the findings, this idea can be ‘ tied up ’ with the political views of the party and the ideas of a successful world revolution.
A four - day shift of work each week had been approved by the Ministry as a way for the benefit of the workers to benefit from the progress of the occult.
An official of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ The reawakening of this system is expected to be announced within a year.
'It may not be possible for a single day, but the working schedule of four days on a week is well suited to the company's policies so that workers can benefit from economic development and new business procedures.'
The Labor Party does not first establish such a view, while the Green Party promised four days of work during the election of 2017.
However, this is not the opinion of all members of the Labor Party.
A spokesman for the Labor Party said: ‘ The four-day Sabbath is not political and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor of John McDonnell took advantage of the conference of the Labor Party last week to offer his opinion of a change in how people can benefit from the world’s economy.
A McDonnell is determined to regain power from the 's desperate correctional and 'profits' of the services.
This leader's motives also mean that those who share in the water companies may not return all their money as the Labor government may make up ‘ to take away some of the money for reasons they feel are wrong.
He also established a plan that would allow workers to register 10 percent, resulting in the obtaining of £500 a year.
A Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy asks "60 Minutes" as a FBI research on Kavanaugh case can change their thinking
The FBI investigation at the alleged trial by Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his final election to the Supreme Court by about a week, and I also bring up the question that if the agency’s search for information should change any copies of the Republican.
During a Sunday discussion, a television reporter "60 Minutes" Scott Kelley asked the presidents of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would cause them to change their thinking.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his South Carolina friend.
"To be sure, it's the same, ” said Kennedy.
"When I am going to hear this case, I have spoken to Judge Kavanauugh.
When this happened, his words came out, ‘ Have you done this?'
She was courageous, determined, firm.
Graham’s project, however, seems to have not been replaced.
"My view of Brett Kavanaugh doesn't change and I have to change unless there is a serious case," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what has happened, but I know only this: Brett strongly denied them, "Graham has added, about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who calls him can't prove this.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything that can change right now."
What is the Festival of International Music? And what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturdays the New York City will be celebrated each year. The festival is held each year, and various musicians sing for the same purpose, to end poverty throughout the world.
This year the seven-year festival will be attended by thousands of people to the Central Park park so that they will not only be entertained by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but will be the public distribution of the event's real purpose to end poverty by the year 2030.
The International Musicians Festival, which began in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, which is fighting the world’s poverty - fighting struggle against poverty.
In order to receive a ticket to the party (only if you want to buy a lottery ticket), the guests must do various tasks or things, such as volunteering, posting an e-mail to a director of the country, calling or any other intelligent device that might help to spread the cause of poverty.
But how much longer is this celebration already running out?
Is the offer of a free visit to the music industry a convenient way to get involved or to fight over the Internet to see if they are doing something superior by simply posting on the Internet or sending a message on Tita?
Since 2011, some 19 million participants have been told that they have been able to fight for their respective goals.
These measures, they say, have encouraged leaders to strengthen and organize $37 billion (U.S.) to care for the needs of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the team mentioned 390 plans for the project, costing up to $10 billion (U.S.).
The money raised by this organization has been able to change the lives of over 649 million people on earth.
Among other things, the UK health plan, which works in "helping children to grow up to their own size," promises to help Rwanda with $33 million of child labor, was the result of the adoption of 4700 messages on Titta.
"With the help of the UK government, the international government, and people like you, we can stop cheating" one of the health advocates, Tracey Ullman told the London music band in April 2018.
More than 5,000 talks by the organization were also encouraged to encourage the UK to improve the health of mothers and children, and the government sponsored a program that could help up to five million children.
In answer to the question they received from their Internet Web site, "Who are you thinking we can overcome poverty?"
The organization replied: "It has been a difficult and time - consuming battle, and sometimes we have to give up and fail.
Yet, if the freedom movement existed back then, we too reach our goals because unity is a force.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and some of the musicians who would play the New York City festival, which would be conducted by Debarra-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the U.S.
The United States "if appropriate" uses its coral reefs to produce precious stones and power from Russia for export, including Asian countries, the US Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner reports.
Zince says that the activities of Russia in Syria, where the country is operating, were called by the official government of the country’s land — a means of obtaining a precious gem market with power.
"I believe that the Russian government has sent its subjects to Asia to find a market for power such as the country is making the European surrender," he said.
In fact, he added that there are ways to deal with these.
"The American country has such a potential, with the use of our Sea soldiers, we can open the doors and if it is necessary to block their power from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke says this about the joint design of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself “the mouth of the users in the United States. ”
He said that the struggle Washington would face with Russia was the same as it did with Iran, saying that its aim would be one.
"Russia and Iran's economy, as well as, improving and changing oil," he said to compare Russia to "the only thing to get profit" on oil.
This has come as the Trump government is in the service of its oil - industry industry in Europe, replacing Russia with Russia’s low - priced oil supply.
In this regard, the leaders of Trump, including the president of the country Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany to move out of the Nord Stream II system that dealt with Russia, Trump said that this system had made Germany a ‘ slave ’ of Russia.
Russia has been falsely claiming a $11 - billion - dollar North Stream project, requiring an increase of up to 110 billion cubic miles [110 million cu km] in size and at the same time as in the nearest financial system.
Russia has been falsely claiming that the U.S.
"I believe we agree that the trade of power would not be a threat to others and that power users should have the opportunity to choose to sell it to them," said President Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the U.S. U.S. Secretary of Defense Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States was not happy with Germany, and Germany was determined to remain united by it.
The Federal Trade Council of Germany (BDI) has asked the United States not to interfere with the European union of power and cooperation between Germany and Russia.
"I am very disappointed in another country when it comes to our use of power," Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI, said after the fall of German leader Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The United States has said that China is doing 'disaster'

U.S. Wednesday, U.S. president of the United States, Donald Trump, mentioned a special section of the newspaper Des Moines Register - newspaper in Iowa, published by the Chinese newspaper when he announced China’s intention to revoke the plans of American counselors on November 6, China.
According to the Reuters newspaper told by American leaders, the decision that Trump made for American election was a new U.S. national campaign against China.
While it is lawful for some foreign countries to put in the press, the Chinese and American countries are competing in business matters, a conflict that has caused both countries to pay large taxes in their own countries.
The tax paid by China on American products was intended to be met by Indian and American merchants from Iowa, who joined the Trump of the Republic, said experts from China and the Americas.
Terry Brustad, a representative of the United States of China and the leader of Iowa, who exports most of the agricultural goods into China, said that China’s activities have brought pain to American workers, farmers, and merchants.
Writing in Des Moines Register, The Postad said that ‘ China’s country is writing a lot of such disturbances by posting false commercial messages in our own distributions."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using the freedom and freedom of the media that the American nation boasts to pay for commercial advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote the Branch.
"Contrary to this, at the street market here in Beijing, you find few antidisclosures and you will not see any light that the Chinese have on the economic problems of China, since journalists are in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," wrote.
Without mentioning his newspaper, he added that "one of China's well-known newspapers had avoided the opportunity to publish its article."

While many of the leaders of the Republican party agree with the choice of Brett Kavanaugh to be a judge in the Supreme Court even of Kavanaugh is thought to have attempted rape against the mother, experts say that this will cause problems, especially from mothers on coming charges.
This issue has caused much controversy, and the Republican group has publicly stated that it is ready to make a resolution in favor of the choosing of the Kavanaugh.
These things can never be recovered, ” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political studies at Maxwell University in Syracuse’s University in an interview with The Hill newspaper on a Saturday.

Although Ford’s evidence of Kavanauugh’s attempts to seize them publicly, experts said that if the Republican party were to ensure the choice of the Kavanauugh people would become very angry.
"These have shown the injustice of the GoP party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to a report of the NBC newspaper.
"It doesn't matter to a committee or a final election or the approval of Kavanauugh as judges only the Supreme Court, but also the methods in which the Republican party has managed the matter and how she deals with the woman," Guy Cecil, U.S. Secretary of Defense, an organization that assists the Democratic Party to be elected.
However, Americans seem to have different opinions on the subject, especially on the basis of the evidence of the Ford and the Kavanaough, and most are on the side of the Kavanaugh.

Additionally, 38 percent said that they felt that Kavauugh had lied to their testimony, while 30 percent said that Ford had lied in their testimony.

Ramirez says that Kavanaugh was shown to them when they went to a party when they studied at Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The founder of the World Wide Web site is trying to set up a Web site that will compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who set up World Wide Web page, is setting up an online page that can be compared to the pages of Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
This new project, called Inrupt, is a company that wants to continue while the Solid program was completed by Berner- Lee.
The Solid page lets the user choose what he will keep and what he wants to see.
In a special conversation with the Fast Company newspaper, a Berners- Lee jokingly said that the aim of Inrupt is "substantly superior."
"We must do it now," he said about the page.
"It's a good name."
The program will use the Solid software program to allow people to create their own "infinite Web site" or POD.
The program can store, carry out, carry a calendar, maintain music and other material and services.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black, and Spotify have been placed together.
A feature of this online storage program is the fact that the user has the right to choose for himself what information he wants to see.
The agency refers to the introduction of the program as "promote through the message."
The director of the company, John Bruce, suggested that our concept of the “Introduction ” may bring to the attention of the public by means of means of a intended means of transmitting facts, techniques, and techniques.
There are now Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety unit of IBS, other computer users employed to prepare the program and various volunteer workers.
Since this week, the world’s computer technicians have been able to prepare their own program by using the tools found on the Incorporation site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his colleagues are not talking to the owners of the Facebook and Googles in the matter of bringing about a complete change in which all their short-depicial events are related.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In an article on the Medium page established on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inruptrition's purpose is to provide commercial power and how the environment affects the environment to protect the interests and advantages of the new program from Solid."
In 1994 Berners- Lee changed the use of the Internet when he introduced his World Wide Web page to a bright school in Massachusetts.
In the past months, Berners- Lee has been speaking on the anti-condition of social networks.
Even after establishing Inrupt, Berners- Lee will continue to be the owner and director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I have great hope for this new program," said Berners- Lee.

"It's the government's order that this was not appropriate to be shown in the morning, so he must turn into a child's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator second of the referee, when asked about the matter.
"Approach the pigs, yes."
The president of the Bellator Scott Coker's company will discuss their program plans to include the UK observers.
We are considering the program over and over again, thinking we might be able to do so, ” Coker said.
"But at six o'clock in the Sunday morning there we can't do this until our Sunday time, Monday.
But we work hard to make the best of it.
Of course, the minute minute turns into convenient text, and everything is not as good as done.
We had to work hard to repair it, and we considered it to be something mechanical.
But it was not the government’s case.
I promise you that this will never happen again.
We will prepare five fights instead of six - as we do and have tried to feed our knuckles further and we have made a mistake in doing so.
It's very difficult.
Conversation on Desert Island: A Tom Darley ‘ hides himself ’ regarding a group of people he likes.
A dramatist at the Olympic Games had grown up hidden behind a crowd of fans, but this gave him the encouragement he needed to succeed.
This 24 - year - old expert said she didn't realize until she got to high school that ‘ everyone isn't like me.'
Speaking on the first four discussions in the Desert Island catalog, published by Lauren Laverne, she said that she is talking about the rights of those who love other men so as to give them "hope."
She also said that being a parent helps her to keep her mind from pursuing a career in sports.
For several months, Kirsten Young, a regular pioneer, was absent from the program because of health problems, but she has not been able to attend this program.
During the first session of Laverne's program, Daley said that she felt that she was growing up with a ‘ social life' because it was not acceptable to love boys and girls."
She said: "To this day I feel left out and a very special feeling of being different is the things that have encouraged me and have given me the strength to do well in my games."
He wants to show people that he was his "owner," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he came to know the group he loved.
This two - time champion in the Olympics has been known as a liberationist in Australia and has used to participate in the Condomic Games in Australia’s Commonwealth of this year in demanding that many countries be legally married.
She says she speaks because she feels she has the opportunity to remain free even if she has confessed that she loves her fellowman so much that she wants to give ‘ encouragement ’ to others.
The actor who won three international films said that a fall in love was the American movie producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "twixed me."
Dale married to the filmmakers, who had also won the championships of Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was, but then he concluded that the difference in age was nothing more than that.
"If you had a lot of things at this age" – he was a 14-year-old Olympic acting and his father died of cancer three years later; he said it was difficult to find someone who had met the doors he had encountered.
In June the family became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that their “right outlook ” had changed.
"If you ask me last year, I'll think more than a gold medal" he said.
"You know, however, there are more good things than the Olympic gold medal.
The gold of the Olympic gold is Robbie's gold.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
She admitted that her father did not want her to die, and one of her priorities was that of finding out if her tickets to participate in a campaign in London in 2012.
"I didn't tell them that you won't be in the future because you will have died," he said.
"I took her by the hand as she died, and it was when she died that I realized she was not eternal," she said.
The following year, Dale won the 2012 Olympic Games and won the crown.
"I knew that these were the dreams I could have been in front of people at the Olympic Games, and there was nothing more than that," he said.
This also encouraged his first choice of Puud’s song - song song composed by Heather Small, which encouraged him to prepare for Olympic dramas and continues to give him a fresh start.
Desert Island Discs is located on BBC News 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, whose lower performances were left outside in the Ryder Sunday cup
Philip Mickelson of the United States has been making a popular Sunday news story while playing his 47 album with the Ruder, but he has to play more than he has ever performed in the middle so that it will never be a bad news.
Mickelson, playing a 12-part drink two years later, was placed outside and played instead by a top athlete, Jim Furryk in four football games with four people.
Instead of being one of the players on this day, the American team who has won five drinks is just talking to his friends and making preparations to promote his games.
The 48-year-old players, who were not most dangerous during their sport, are not the most qualified players in the hard - to-do Le Golf National cup, where a long - distance ball is a poor beat.
And if the game is not very dangerous, Mickelson will meet Francesco Molinari, a British athlete who played with Tommy Fleetwood, who has just started playing the game and won the four-week games this week.
If American athletes, who remain with 4 percent of their first 12 - grade players, can drink better, Mickelson’s performance may be more important.
Furryk said he would trust her, but she did not say so much.
"She understood what she needed to do today, thanked me and hugged me and told me that she was ready for the drama tomorrow," Furryk said.
"He is independent of himself.
He is a Master of burner, and he has done much of his work in the past, as well as this week.
I don’t expect him to play two games.
I expect the stars to play many games, but that is how we feel about them.
She wants to play like everyone else.
On Sunday Mickleson shows more than Nick Faldo in playing several games in the Ruder cup.
This will lead to the end of the game that is different from the way it is playing alone.
Mickelson won 18 times, a 20 - to - 7. Between 7 and 7 times, yet Furryk says that his presence encourages his team.
"He’s fun, joking, joking, and he's good to be with a team," he explained.
"I think young athletes were delighted to play with him, this week, which was fun to see.
He gives more than play.
European football team leader Thomas Bjorn knows that their lead could end
Thomas Bjorn knows from past history that their lead in the Ruder cup can easily change and become a difficult weapon to protect.
The Danish player played its first games in Valderrama in 1999, where a team whose leader was Sever Ballestero led five percent above the American team but won only 141,55 minutes.
"I remind myself that we were leading very well in Valderrama; we were leading very well in Brookline, where we had fallen, and in Valderrama where we had won, but in few notes," Bjorn, after seeing a good team in 2018 above 5-3 Friday and on a day to take the lead by 10-6 in Le Golf National.
Thus history teaches us that the games are not finished.
We have to put forth effort tomorrow.
Let us go to the theater and enjoy doing the best.
The drama was about to unfold, leading to a series of deaths.
We have a goal to try to climb the cup, and here is where we should focus our attention.
I have always said that I am interested in the 12 players in our team, and we know who we are going to play the best players in the world."
Thrilled with how his players played in the complex theater, Bjorn said: "I can't feel myself alone.
The games will be played tomorrow.
Each person’s experience, like that of others, is unique.
It is good to play with your toes when things are going well, but you have to play on yourself, when the players are fully tried.
The message that should be conveyed to athletes is that they play the part of the next day.
In this case you leave your partner and he or she should be a man again.
In contrast with Bjorn team, Jim Furryk will want his players to win more than two players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four notes.
Furryk himself has witnessed both phases of the revolution, having been a team that won before the Brookline before becoming a team that gave way to the European team when it was ‘ performed miracles ’ in Medinah.
"I remember anything," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of the 1999 actress, encouraged his players by the final day of the game.
"We have 12 games, but we have to stand up first, as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When this happens, one team of middle - school athletes becomes stressed.
We have organized our games, and we have set up a game which shows that we want to do wonderful things tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to initiate the lead of his friends and will play with Rory Mcllroy in major games, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter will play with the European team players according to the European show.
"I set these players this way because I believe they will help us to reach the end," he said of his choice of individual players.
The founding of a German warship is under way
A new German warship was to be established in 2014 to replace the old ship used in the Cold War but not until the next year because of the collapse of the ship's system and the change in trees, the country's newspaper said.
According to reports in the newspaper Die Zeit, the establishment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet has been changed to the first part of 2019.
The ship was to be used by the military in 2014, but the difficulty in bringing it into the ship was disturbing the establishment of the ship.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships purchased in 2007 will replace the ancient Bremen.
We note that these ships have powerful guns, oil - carrying bombs, and rockets and other modern technology, such as flying unveiling.
Other requirements are that the ships will work long enough before they are designed to use the ships away from our ports for two years.
However, the delay in the use of ships would change Germany's use in some countries - means that it would be possible to survive the ships, the newspaper Die Zeit said.
The failure of the F125 fleet became well - known last year when the German navy refused to set up the ship and sent it back to the Berlin and Voss train station in Hamburg.
This was the first time he had been caught off guard to a railway company.
The reasons for the ship's restoration are not clear, but German newspapers have announced that there were ‘ the problem and the necessary programs and items" that make the ship useless when used.
The difficulty of the programs was a big factor because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are supposed to carry 120 - half - - - - half soldiers on the Bremen fleet.
In addition, these vessels were known to be the richest ones that slow down the operation of the fleet and prevent the crew from improving the operation.
The Rheinland-Pfalz ships weigh some 7,000 tons, meaning that they are twice as heavy as the ships used by German soldiers during World War II.
Apart from the failure of the ship's design, the cost of all ship-building, including the training of sailors, is disturbing.
It is estimated that it amounted to £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) — a rise from the first $1.2 billion.
The problems affecting these ships are becoming a major factor when the German navy sounds less likely to become a threat to the U.S.
Early this year, Hans-Per Bartels, director of a security committee in a German parliamentary building, admitted that he had been hit by a ‘ train shortage.
The officer said that it had been a long time since the old ships were out of use but that the replacement ships were not given.
He concluded that in the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships there was no ship to be used by the Austrians.
National Trust shedding the lives of bats
A new study conducted in a home in Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use their habitat to search for food.
We hope that what he sees will also illuminate new species of rare beasts and help improve future management projects.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will examine well-known species of soprano pastrelles as well as blue whales with long ears and Daubenton at Invele Gardens in Western Ross.
Special photographs will be placed around the area necessary to keep track of bats during this period.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also do research in various areas using hand probes.
Tests of noise recorded by experts will reveal the volume of bats and what kind they are doing.
A map may also be prepared to provide more information about the location and behavior of the people around them.
Rob Dewar, an NTS security adviser, believes that the outcome will reveal areas that are vital to bats and where they are used by any form.
This will help you to see the value of caring for their environment, such as cultivating a good crop and caring for the timber of bats and related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has dropped dramatically during the past century.
They are under threat of construction and development that affects how bats gather to rest during the day and the loss of their habitat.
Wind and light systems may also pose a threat, such as the paper that holds flies and other building materials, as well as the consumption of insects.
Insects are not nearly blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are even more effective than their eyes when they want to touch animals.
They use a more efficient method to detect insects and interfere with the flight of birds.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 old buildings, 38 vital gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] throughout the country, hold bats in high regard.
It is home to ten trained researchers, often studying, studying the habitat of bats for resting during the day and at other times a rescue dream.
The organization has also established a single, special park in the Scottland National Park on Treave in Dumfries and Galloway, an eight - species native of Scotland.
According to director David Thompson, the site is a good place for them.
"We have an excellent area of bats here," he said.
"We have old homes, many old trees, and all good places.
But there is much about bats that are not presently known, so the work we do here and in other homes will help us to understand much of what it requires to live well."
He also spoke of the need to search for bats before repairing the home because destroying one of the breeding grounds can kill 400 amphibians and children, and this could kill all bats in the area.
Insects are protected and not allowed to kill, torture, or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of Scotland’s Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged people to help too.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species do not know how they are.
Ronaldo refuses to rape anyone, and his colleagues try to get a German magazine to print it
Cristiano Ronaldo says that the case has been accused of rape and "false stories," saying that people want "to exalt themselves" by his name.
His lawyer wanted to publish the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published this article.
In 2009 an American actress named Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas ’ hotel room, was accused of being a rape victim of an American woman.
It is said that he paid her $37,000 to avoid reporting what had happened, Der Spiegel said Friday.
Speaking in the video Insagram Live to 142 million of his followers just a few hours after the report was made, 33 - year - old Ronaldo denounced the reports as "false stories."
"No, no, no, not.
What they say today is a false story," the winner of Ballon d'or five times did it through a camera.
"They want to exalt themselves by my name.
Not unusual
They want to be known by my name, but this is the kind of work they do.
I am a happy but nice person, "The athlete added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to introduce Der Spiegel on the subject, which is called "unconventional reports on secret doubts," according to Reuters.
The critic Christian Schchertz said that the player may cry for tears as a result of being contaminated by his good behavior to the extent of the case, which must be the case of the greatest person's reputation and rights in recent years.
It was reported in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino rooms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the night classroom, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the theater, where they are said to have raped her, according to documents preserved at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga is said to have bowed down after what she said and told him that it is "99% good man" who has failed at only "1%".
The documents say that Ronaldo had made sure that the two had sexual relations, but they did so together.
Mayorga also said that she had gone to the police where the images of her injuries were taken from the hospital, but later she agreed to settle the matter on her own because she saw that she was “in fear of reprisals" and is concerned that she is ‘ embarrassed in the community."
The 34 - year - old girl admits that she is now trying to change the decision on her own, but she still feels bad about what she said.
Ronaldo was about to win the Real Madrid team from Manchester United at the time of the event, and that summer he moved to Juve’s largest team in Italy for an investment of £100 million.
Brexit: UK'll always regret the loss of the car manufacturers
If the UK has lost its responsibilities as one world number after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said this.
He also said that it is "guests" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without cooperation it could temporarily shut down to his factory at Burkaston, near Derby.
"We want unity," says Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer said that delays at the border if there is no agreement on Brexit could result in a breakdown in the work force.
Burnaton - Arnaston, which makes up the Auris and the Aventas ’ species of Toyota, produced some 150,000 cars last year and 90 percent sent to other European countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of March we can see the construction projects shut down in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, chief executive officer in Toyota, Burkaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have discussed their fears and the matter of leaving the EU without a joint agreement on how to purchase and sell between countries, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close his Master factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
One of the greatest concerns of car manufacturers is that there is uncertainty about how to deliver goods to consumers if there is a difference between Brexit.
Toyota makes its vehicles "like a request" for its clients, and the fuel for cars comes every 37 minutes from UK and EU salesmen on vehicles that are made in accordance with the application of customers.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March, there may be restrictions on the limits that the industry is supposed to cause delay and lack of auto cause.
It would not be possible for Toyota to hold the one - day product to his factory in Derbyshire, the company says, thus making it possible to shut down.
Clark said that the Theresa May of the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is "individed exactly to avoid delay on the boundaries."
"We want to be united. We want to have a very good unity that would allow as much as I say, not just to win right now but to take advantage of this opportunity, "He told BBC Radio 4 on Today's program."
The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to carry on a method that has been very effective in distributing goods to consumers. ”
Toyota could not say how long the delay was, but in time, it showed that this extra income could reduce the sale of the factory against other factories and eventually damage the job.
Peter Tsouvallris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is working as a team in Unite for the factory, says that its members are deeply concerned: ‘ When I’ve lost my job, it doesn’t come back.
A government prophet said: "We have established an accurate and reliable system for our future relationship with EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein convention can be delayed, says the White House authorities
The supreme conference of Donald Trump and the second of the attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be ‘ delayed for another week' while the battle against those selected at the Great Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, the older men of White House said the Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises special engineering projects by Robert Mueller, researching Russian elections, cooperation between the Trum and Russia sponsors and what the president can do to correct justice.
The issue of whether Trump would withdraw the office of the prime minister of the government and thus destroy Mueller’s rights has been a source of gossip for months in Washington.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using a drawing to draw a link with Trump as well as the possibility of exterminating the president by means of a 25th decree.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where reports of his resignation were reported.
Rather, the convention with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that it would be "not like" to withdraw Rosenstein from his office but later that the assembly was delayed to be held simultaneously by the Senate’s judgment committee, Kavanauugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Christine Blasey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate for one week of the charges against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the full vote of the Senate.
The writer of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein convention, he said: "The day of this was not set, it might be this week, I can also see that it is a week late in view of all other developments in the larger court.
But we will see how it ends and I like the media to know the current news.
Some journalists may object: Sanders have never had a reporter on the White House since September 10.
A roommate named Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the limited meeting was not due to the ‘ love of popularity ’ of the journalists of "TV", even as he said: "I can't deny the fact that they like to be popular."
He then said that the direct connection between Trump and the media would increase.
"The President performs more questions and answers than any president has ever been," he said, adding without saying the evidence: "Please check those numbers."
Journalist meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but "If the journalists have the opportunity to ask direct questions, I am better than to talk to me.
We are trying very hard to do this and have seen us do this a few weeks ago, instead of a meeting with the journalists in which you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump always answers questions when they leave White House or join in the discussion or speak to the most respected person.
The meetings of the press are low.
In New York this week the president may have shown why, in the presence of a free and sometimes unexpected appearance before a press conference.
A health secretary writes to the EU staff of NFS Scotland because of the fear of Brexit
A health secretary writes to the EU staff in Scotland’s NFS expressing appreciation for the country and wants them to stay at Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent less than six months to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already offered to cover the cost of asking the EU citizens for their work.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, the debate between the UK and the EU on the matter of departure continues, and I expect elections to occur at the end of this rainy season.
But the UK government has also encouraged planning for what would happen if there were no cooperation.
I know that it will be a time of great trouble for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat now as I appreciate the contributions of each worker, no matter where he comes from.
My friends from all over the EU and beyond come to serve as experts in promoting health care and in assisting the sick and the places where we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Surgery With a Headache
The players behind the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was operated on a head injury on Saturday when his team collapsed by 31 to 27 women and the Vanderbilt Commonres team, Mike Organ, a journalist from Tennessee.
Rod Reed told the journalists that the damage was approaching the end of the first section.
"He came alongside and collapsed," Reed said.
Teachers and drawers put Abercrombie on oxygen at the open field before putting her on the pillow and taking her to the hospital for better lighting.
An official at the University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released from surgery at the Vanderbilal Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘ there is no information about how she was injured first" and that the Tennessee State is looking for a time when she was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is the first to play in the Tennessee State team after returning from Illinois.
Before leaving the stadium on Saturday, he closed the stadium and had five falls, leading to a death of 18 times.
Foreign customers will be charged with higher taxes when they buy property at the UK
Foreign customers will pay high taxes at the UK and will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This idea disrupts the success of Corbyn’s efforts to lure youths into making a choice
Extra taxes will be paid to those who do not pay UK tax
Economic interests are expected to earn 120 million pounds [120 million] a year to help the homeless
Foreign customers will pay a high tax on UK - and will be used to help the homeless, which Theresa May announce today.
The idea seems to frustrate the success of what Corbyn has done to persuade youths to vote for him by promises to provide low - cost housing and to improve those who have received a lot of money.
Additional taxes will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes to the UK, and additional funds will contribute to the State’s maintenance of sleep problems under the bridges.
Additional - these include present tax payments, as well as high points developed two years ago in old homes and real - estate transactions to produce a rent - may be about three percent.
Economic interests are expected to earn as much as 120 million pounds [120 million kg] a year.
About 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by non - UK residents, raising trees and making it difficult for consumers first to make up the first piece of land to have a home.
Most of the rich areas of the country - especially in large cities have become like ‘ empty villages ’ because of the large number of foreign buyers who live for a long time outside the world.
This new rule comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson declared that the tax must be reduced to help many young people have a first house.
They have denounced large construction firms for raising housing costs but not using them, and have encouraged Mrs. May to leave their fields in low-soiled homes to prepare "the shame of the house."
Corbyn has announced a fine list of fine plans for new buildings, including rent repair and removal of the "free".
He also wants to give the well - equipped strength to build a new one.
She said: "Last year I gave my first duty to restore British dreams - so that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our damaged house’s shop.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a good life here.
However, it would not be correct for people outside the UK, as well as for foreign companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens.
For many people, having a home is considered impossible, and sleeping under bridges is still a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to teach a Scotland team'
Sunderland Jack Ross says that his main goal is "to become a Scottish team instructor at one time.
Born in Scotland, 42 years of age, he is thrilled with the refreshing job of the North-East workshop, which is still at the third point in the League One, and three points from above.
They moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after leading St Merren back to the Scottish Premiership during the past summer.
"I wanted to play my country if I played the game.
I found a B level and so," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sport.
"But I grew up helping Scotland with my father in Hampden as a child, and it always reminds me of the past.
The opportunity will come, unless I have done well to repair the clubs.
First Ross as Sunderland manager was Dick Advocaat, David Moys, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo di Canio.
A former Alloa Attic teacher said that he was not afraid to follow the well - known names in such a large classroom, when he rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at present will be confirmed by the answer to the question 'Can I be able to return this class to the Premir League?'
Because of the design and materials found in the classroom, it is obviously the Premir League, ” he said.
"It's a very difficult task to get there, but I still feel that I'm the best class if I can get it back there."
Ross has been serving as overseer for only three years, after working a long time as an assistant to the Dambarton classroom and a 15 - month period as a general staff of the Hearts team.
He then helped Alloa to keep it from falling to the third grade, and he helped the nearby St Mirren classroom to win the contest.
And Ross is said to feel better now than he did at the time of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St.Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
Perhaps it was time to make a big choice, "Remember, ” to teach the Alloa classroom.
"I really believed that the work of oversight was more suitable for me than to play.
I felt strange because I had done well, had a good job, and enjoyed other things.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I continue to feel stressed and pressured by work, but the work of oversight is very good for me.
I always want to be in charge and now do so, I feel much better than before in my entire adult life.

The best time to drink is on Saturday evening, research
Summer heat has benefited British alcohol companies who are suffering but have caused many problems in restaurants.
Alcoholics saw an increase of 2.7% in the alcohol trade in July - but the cost in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, CGA, business consultants, who write these numbers, said: ‘ The sun’s passing and taking an unexpected part of England in World Cup Games will make the July events similar to June, while the barmaids saw a 2.8 - percent increase, apart from fast - suffering restaurants.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurants in June continued in July.
All who handle alcoholic beverages are better off than at certain restaurants.
The food and drink industries also suffered during the summer season, though they are not as hard as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink.
A well - managed alcohol trade saw a 6.6 - percent increase in the same month, and food sellers fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM friend and host, said: ‘ The following is continuing on what we have seen since the end of April.
Changing weather and social or play activities have a significant impact on the market outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to suffer, and a decline of 4.8 percent a year is a major problem, especially in the high cost of living.
A long hot summer may not be a good time for food vendors and time will prove that the winter we experienced in August will provide needed relief.
The increase in the sales of alcohol and consumers, including the more recently opened businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a reduction in the production of new products.
Coffer Peach Traveler is responsible for research into UK music and restaurants and collect and monitor 47 groups, which have a value of $9 billion, and their products are highly reliable.

Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to be a member of the Scottish Atthletics Commission as the executive director of the annual conference of the governing body.
Doyle, a Scottish athlete and chairman Ian Beattie, described the election as a good opportunity for those who improve the sport to benefit from its many world experiences during the past ten years.

Doyle said: "I want to be like a runner's voice, and I hope to help to improve the game in Scotland."
An American, who won 200 feet [200 m] and 400 m] meter at the 1996 Games in Atlanta between the four Olympic gold he discovered and now is a well - known BBC specialist, was left unable to move about in the form of a drug problem.
He wrote on Twutter: "Last month I suffered a stroke.
I cannot walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine my recovery or the extent of it.
It was hard work, but I recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing fast!
Thank you for an encouraging message!
Breast - feeding, compared with women and dairy products, has brought a wide range of comments on the Internet
A milk - processing company has dropped a wide range of comments on the Internet and an adhesion of mothers who are breast - feeding and dairy - fed cattle.
In order to "start" a quietly working handgun, Elvie's company has set up a music album with a comic film to advertise the freedom that the camp offers to nursing mothers.
The four real mothers in the dairy herd dance with the words: "Yes, I’m calm, but you don't see the tail" and "If you didn't realize that this is not the cow's milk, and my own breasts."
The song went on as follows: "Burn, kiss, nurse, kiss, and bury my mother."
However, this ads, which have been broadcast on the company’s Facebook page, have brought mold on the Internet.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the film has been received differently by viewers, many claiming to show the ‘ cover ’ of the milk industry.
It is a very bad idea of using milk cows to transport the equipment.
As we should take in and give birth to produce milk, unless their children are removed in a few days after giving birth, they have written another.
Elvie’s breastpiece is well suited during breast clothes (Elvie / Mother)
Another said: "I’m sad for both mother and child.
But why don't use the breast milk of mothers who care for their babies?
Another added: ‘ Such a disproportionate advertising."
Some preferred the ads, while a single mother admitted that the song "I am fun."
"I think it’s a good idea.
I would have had one if I were still a nurse.
It makes me feel like a cow.
These delivery is not very suitable, but I am not angry with it.
This is a wise thing, "So wrote another.
Another said: "This is a pleasant discharge of the women who pour (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "Bows of milk."
This is not a campaign to advertise or judge the milk companies.
At the end of the film, a group of women reveals that all the dancers have these secret pipes.
The idea of spices is well established in understanding that many nursing mothers say they feel like milk cows.
Elvie Pump, however, works quietly, with no noses or tubes and is well fitted in breast clothes, and gives a mother the right to move, to touch her children, and even to go somewhere else immediately.
The Ana Bharin, her partner and ECD on the Mother, also said: "Elvie Pump is such a new thing that it should be developed with care and pleasure.
Comparing the relationship between mothers and dairy cattle we wanted to keep the breast milk and its problems clear, and show it in an interesting and easy way to remember the freedom that this new camp will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s camp is in place.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared at the exhibition of the inventor Marta Jabowski using the camp.
Hundreds of Immigrants Go to the Temanite Camp in Texas
The number of children moving to another country has increased or even passed the limit of the month has not changed, perhaps because of feelings of fear and considerations developed by the Trump government that have made it difficult to give children to helpers.
Traditionally, many helpers have moved to another country without registration, and fear of losing their status as permanent residents when they come to seek help for a child.
The problem was growing in June, while the authorities had announced that those who wanted to attend and other adults in their families had to give their fingers to their fingers, and that they would share with the authorities in the entry and discharge of the people within the border.
Last Saturday, Matthew Albence, chief of the Immigration and Customs Enforrcing, testified before the Congress that the council had arrested many people who had registered to assist these children who came alone.
The commission later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no record of criminal activity.
"About 80 percent of the people who are aided or their family members are illegal in this country, and most of these are foreigners with a history of crime.
So we continue to search for these people, ” says Alence.
In order to help the children more enthusiastically, the authorities have established new laws that require some of them to appear in court in one month of their custody, not after 60 days, as they used to do, according to room workers.
Many will appear by means of a screen, instead of a specific method, in an appeal to the judge of the country.
Those who may feel unworthy will be hurried back to their homeland.
The longer the children stay in tents, the more they become anxious or frustrated, which can cause violence or escape, according to sleep workers and reports that have appeared in order in recent months.
The lawyers said that complaints grow in such large areas as Tornillo, where signs of suffering are often ignored because of the size of such areas.
They added that bringing children to a tent without giving them enough time to prepare their hearts or to keep up with their friends can be devastating to many who are already suffering.
Syria tells the US, France, and Turkey to leave immediately
When speaking to the UN General Assembly of the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also called refugees from Syria to return home, even the world’s war is in the eighth year.
Mouleam, also the Chief Minister's assistant, said that these foreign soldiers were in the country illegally, falsely accused of combating terrorism, and ‘ would be punished equally.
"It should leave immediately without everything said," said the conference.
Mouleam insisted that "the war against terrorism is about to end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
Damascus also says that it will continue in this holy war until we have swept away all the regions of Syria."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially those who teach and instruct the Kurdish soldiers and the Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 active soldiers in a war - torn country.
In the case of the refugees, Mouleam said that things were better for them to return, and he condemned "the rest of the Western world" because it was the "exploiting of a morbid fear" that made the refugees not want to return.
"We have asked foreign countries and relief agencies to help those who want to return," he said.
"They include politics in a matter which should be only a matter of public interest."
The United States and the European Union say that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until the political alliance between Assad and the opposers of the war will cease.
The UN General says that the recent cooperation between Russia and Turkey to establish the last security line with the various Idwards has provided an opportunity to continue political debate.
This intermittent agreement between Russia and Turkey has restricted the tremendous persecution of the Syrians in this area, which numbers three million people.
Moulem, however, argued that the union " has the last time" and shows hope that the soldiers will only hit the jihadst people, including Nusra Front soldiers who have confirmed Al-Qaeda, who are "will be destroyed."
UN Minister Staffan de Mistura hopes to invite the first meeting of a new state committee as well as opposition members to adjust the rules of Syria after the war and to establish a method of decision making.
Mouleam explained how the Syrian government is involved in this committee, saying that the organization's work must be intended to "recheck the existing laws of the land," and warn the people who want to interfere with the project.
Why the Trump Will Succeed a Second Time
With such ideas, A Trump will be reelected in 2020 elections unless, as many observers expect, the judgment and crime end his leadership before it is due to time.
In what would it be like "The Most Amazing End of Headship!"
From this point on, there are no references to the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of people on the night watches has grown from 2 million to 1.5 million in the CNN, with an average of three to 1.6 million in NSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million night television viewers, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show" of the MSNBC has as many as 3.5 million viewers on the big night news.
"This is a problem that people are being brought in because we do not fully understand it," said Nel Baer, actor of ABC "Designed Survival," about the secretary of the president who becomes president after the destruction has devastated Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comicist and writer "Just the Sunny Parts: And a New Hard Truth About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another idea
They remember his ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
She said, "Because she makes me laugh," "Mama Scovell told me."
This is a cause for rejoicing.
Indeed, unlike anything on TV, news from Washington can reveal the future of Roe v. Wade, whether families of foreign countries can be reunited and economic health worldwide.
Praise is a precious asset that those who view privileged ones are able to achieve.
In fact, they continue to be an exceptionally well- informed citizen in six hours of a group of scholars arguing about how Bob Woodard uses "deep history" to obtain his "Faar," Paul Manafort's coat of $15,000 (" full and very proud clothing, ” said Washington Post) and the scientific interpretation of Stormy Daniels for Trumps.

When I arrived at the Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees outside his home in northern Kauai, but he was too busy inside to see the MSNBC immediately recording CNN news reports.
They could not stop viewing it, not by the case of Brett Kavanaugh who is preparing to meet the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court that depends on the outcome.
"I remember when we made all the scenes of the past and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization's demise," Fleiss told me to do so.

Large amounts of money are being used to help the counselors ’ inner elections
Little wonder that the 17th section of Pennsylvania is seeing the huge expenditure, resulting in the restructuring of legal sectors that allowed two people to compete in the same seat.
The recent restoration of the map of the district of Pittsburgh allows the Conor Lamb who represents the Democrat party to buy a plot - which won his seat in another portion in a recent special election.
Lamb competes with a member of the Republican Congregation, Keith Rothfus, who now struggles for the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which corresponds closely to the new 17th.
Map was changed to the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania after it ruled in January that the former sections were changed for the sake of the Republican Party.
A competition in this 17th section has triggered the use of more money on the project, the Democratic Impact DRM Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campign Committee (NRC) (NRC).
The name Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania after a brief winning in a special election that was widely observed in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
It has been a territory conquered by the Republican Party for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the section by 20 percent.
Politicalists have given the Democrats a small measure of success.
U.S. tested El Salvador for supplementation, and then returned
The graduates said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already been working with Beijing, without major obstacles from Washington.
The Trump had lovingly met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his friends removed the Trump Congregation.
Government officials had decided to invite U.S. attorney generals who work in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of the ‘ recent lack of knowledge of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department' minister, said in his opening remarks this month.
But punishments are thought to be given to El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug rehabilitation, development, and economic support.
The sanctions, which include stopping financial services and refraining from granting licenses, would have been devastating to the majority of the unemployed in Central America, and there would have been much more crime.
While the conference was in progress, the authorities in North America and Central America postponed a large convention in hopes of one that later described security and material to follow this one last year that seemed to be a more efficient way to deal with immigrants in the United States.
By mid- September, however, the board of officials had indicated that they wanted the meeting to progress, and I immediately dismissed any suggestion that punishments be given in El Salvador.
The second president, Mike Ponce, is now preparing for the convention, which is now scheduled in mid - October, to highlight the importance of the convention.
And three delegates from the United States returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no messages of cruelty or punishment from Washington.
The White House Prophet Bolton refused to answer the arguments presented by three American officials, including two generals, who had agreed to discuss the inner conversations in a private way.
Their accounts were confirmed by foreign experts who were close to the supervisors and said this in a private way.
Learn From the Past
The next article that will take place may be the release of Robert Mueller’s report on the Trump’s corruption, now a clear testimony to human writings.
Mueller says that he is also studying to see if the Trump campaign had collaborated with Russia to interfere with our choices.
When the Constitutional Court changes leadership, the Trump has found himself facing questions to answer to that council, as he is planning to meet again with lawyers, and perhaps at the end of the trial.
There are many questions to answer, and I do not mean that the falls of the Trump are inevitable, even similar to those in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on all sides of the U.S.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to make a conspiracy against Hitler, unless West would reject him and help the Czech population in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible years that followed.
The past has been achieved through this unique history, and the process of democracy can be either hurried or delayed.
Several Americans are experiencing these conditions right now.
What will we do if the Trumps removed the role of Rod Rosenstein II to the Grand Commissioner, who oversees the research involving Mueller?
Last year, Rosenstein has been in great trouble since the paper also said that he had proposed a secret vote for the president and that the president is unfit for office.
Rosenstein points out that The Times is wrong.
"How will we respond if a recent request from F.B.I. to investigate Brett Kavanauugh's case is not enough or unjust - or if it has been proved as a judge at the High Court even if there is sufficient evidence of rape and lying?
And above all, will we vote with the body’s counselors who will make the Trump answer to his cases?
If we fail to do so, it will take a long time to arrive.
But I am sure we will not fail, thanks to the education I had received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that used to live in my convent.
She survived and moved to the United States, and after 60 years, I was sent to light a Sabbath candle on a table with swastika signs.
With such an inheritance, how can I be without hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans, a member of the Rings team, believes he can perform better with the Rapid Vienna team
The Ringers are playing at the door with the Rapid Vienna Thursday, following their similar success with the Spanish Villarreal team at the beginning of this month, the Ringers must conquer the Australian team, giving them the opportunity to go to the second cup of European scholars in the League of G.
The knee injury of Graham Dorrans, who plays in the center, has made him unable to play his first symmetric game until the day he compared the power of the Villarrea team 2 to 2 to 2 but he believes Ringers can use what he did on the game as a good start of major things.
The "Pont we found was important to us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old expert.
"We entered the stadium, hoping we could do well on the game, and we got one.
Perhaps we were able to win the game at the end of the game, but the combination of power was one of life’s least.
They did well in the first part, and we did well the second part and had a good team.
Thursday is a big game in the UEFA competition.
Thankfully, we can take all three parts but then become very tough because they won the game but then take our fans at home and I hope we can get up and win the game.
Last year it was very difficult, especially for my injuries and other changes in the team, but now things are very difficult.
Sports can be fun and exciting; the games are fun.
Maybe we can stop it now, and I forget about the past so that we can do well."
Women who sleep fear that they will not get enough sleep after a day’s work begins
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, few spoke to their brothers about these.
About half of the people who surveyed in Nationwide said that they talked to their wives about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they had talked with their children about this.
"People want a relative to care for them, but they don't take the initiative to talk about the matter," said Holly Snyder, second to the president of the Nationwide Life insurance company.
Consider how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the time when you are not giving your needs in advance.
Work with your mentor and with your family to discuss where and how to respond, since decisions may be needed in determining the cost.
Ask your financial mentor: Your mentor can also help you find a way to pay the bill.
Your choice of long - term care costs may include long - term social insurance, expensive life - insurance insurance for this money or making yourself insurance with your assets as much as money can.
Write your legal documents: Check legal battles when you go.
Seek a health - care agent instead of you to select a reliable person to monitor your medical care and to make sure that your needs are met by experts if you can't speak.
On the other hand, consider what is involved in your financial well - being.
You can choose a reliable person to replace your finances and make sure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
Don't forget little: Suppose your aged parents are seriously ill and are going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about health and health problems?
Make a complete note of these steps that you can take to be prepared:
"Not only is the money to be fixed, but who are the docks?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who will care for the dog?
Be prepared for that.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that ravaged the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with an increase in death toll.
As a result of the breakdown in the system, relief authorities were unable to receive much from the Dontutria area of the north Coast, a vast area close to a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake.
In Pala, more than 16,000 people were deported after the disaster.
Here are a few of the many details regarding the Palutia and the Dontalia, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is a large city in the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a small coastal plain on the west coast of Sulawesi, which is home to some 379,800 people in 2017.
It was the 40th year of the earthquake.
The Dontolaa is an area that travels more than 300 miles [180 km] northwest of Sulawesi.
The area, located in the lower part of the region, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are essential to the economy of the Central Sulawesi, especially the area around the Dontutia.
Nickel's mines are reused in this region, but they are widely available in Morowali, the coastal area facing Sulawesi.
During the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Organization, Plu and Dontatia suffered a number of tsunamis.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dontatia
Tsunami was also on the west coast of Dontitía in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
A list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The massive earthquake on the western coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 on the Indian Ocean, over half of them from the Aceh.
2005: A number of devastating earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds had died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake 6.8 occurred in southern Java, Indonesia’s largest island, which triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and claimed some 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital of the state of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring about 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra and triggered a 40 - foot [10 m] tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed some 300 lives.
2016: A small earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and fear because people were reminded of the earthquake and the tsunami that killed so many people in 2004.
No tsunami was to begin, but more than 100 people were killed by the buildings that fell on them.
2018: high earthquakes ravaged Indonesia’s largest island of tourists in Lombok, with over 500 casualties, especially in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of temporary suffering visitors.
Sarah’s Chief Son Domin Found Place in Family Violence

In December 2017, he is accused of beating his father, Todd Lulin.
Her mother, Sarah Nulun, had shouted to the police to get the violence done
The case is still in Alaska’s Adult Court
In January 2016 she was charged with domestic violence, disturbing the report and having a gun on the subject.

In 2016 Sarah Nulin was reprimanded by adult soldiers after linking the subject of her son's abuse with PTSD’s disease that was attributed to his career as a soldier in Iraq.
An earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds have been killed
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday in Indonesia
An earthquake measuring 7.5 started a tsunami and damaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working and death rates are expected to rise in the future.

The videos that they shared in the media portray a real time of calamity.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the shore.
Government judges want victims of the lyC terrorist attack to accept the strange decision of death
Justices in New York City want Saillo Saipov to be sentenced to death, where they are charged with lynchings in NYC and killing eight people — an unusual decision that has not been handed down by a government court since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a trailer at Home Depot to do terrorist work on a highway near West Side Higway’s main road in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and pedestrians in October.
In confirmation of the legality of the death penalty, judges must prove that Saipov " purposely" had killed the eight people and had been seriously injured others, in accordance with the ruling of this decision, which was issued in the Southern District in New York.
All cases involve the death penalty, according to a court order.
A few weeks after the trial, the high court found Saipov guilty of 22 criminal offenses involving eight cases of fraud, the court justices of the Supreme Court, and the violence and damage of cars.
The case was "regulated and carefully considered," the judges said, explaining how Saipov had dealt with the "declar, cruel and very serious" case.
"Syfullo Habullaevic Saipov has also caused some injuries, as well as the pity of the brothers and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dagnuco," a request concerning the decision has been made.
Five of those affected were foreigners from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the Supreme Court of New York issued a decision to kill.
The judge, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to the Soviet Union as a spy during the Cold War or Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were killed by power station on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, indicated not to be concerned about what he had done during the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
When they told the researchers that they felt good about what they had done, the police said.
Saipov told government officials that he had been encouraged to do this after viewing his SIS films on his phone, according to much of his case.
He also asked to show the IIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He rejected the 22 charge.
David Patton, one of the Saipov representatives, said he was ‘ disappointed" by the election of the state juries.
"We think the idea of accepting the death penalty rather than accepting an appeal to remain in prison and not having the opportunity to be released may add to the sorrow of any affected," noted Patton.
Sailov’s attorneys had already ordered that the judges be spared the death penalty.
NIGEL FRANCE should oversee the discussions of Brexit
Nigel Farage promised that he would ‘ call a class of people like war today on the exhibition at the General Assembly.
A former Ukip leader said that politicians should be ‘ forced from EU - as one of Theresa May's counselors that they should be responsible for communication with EU.
Peter Bone, who was backend, told the people in Birmingham that the UK 'had gone out so far if the Farages were the Writer of Brexit'.
But the difficulty facing May in restoring large - scale territories has been confirmed by Disconstitutes in order to participate in anti - Brexit demonstrations in the city.
The elder is endeavoring to make his plan in favor of Rexit, E. U.S. E., and the EU.
His colleagues claimed that they were still trying to cooperate with Brussels even in the face of opposition and pressure from the EU and the Labor Party to choose between what they offer and the 'declaration'.
The Bone told a conference with a title from From Solihull that he wanted to 'rejecters of the Brexit Ecumenism'.
He also said that the Farages would have to take part and be given the responsibility to speak with Brussels.
'If this was how he led the matter, we'd have been out here,' he said.
The Welllinbweugh U.S. U.S.
In his defense against the EU, he said: ‘ We did not fight for the whole world to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone denied the arguments that people's opinions have changed since the 2016 vote: 'It is not true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain.'
The Brexiteer Andrea Jokns was present at the exhibition, telling the press: ‘ I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘ Living in the EU is not required by men, the OU may not agree with this, neither is it necessary by our party and the active forces who struggle to make the choice.
Please leave EU and start listening to people.'
For the mother of May, she added: ‘ The elders as prime minister keep their duties as they fulfill their promises.'
Farage told the audience at the conference that politicians should be ‘ forced into submission ’ if they are not faithful to the elections of 2016.
Now it's a reliable story between us - and our political party, he said.
'They are trying to be dishonest in the matter of Brexit, and we're here to tell them 'We won't let you do this.'
In his message to the interested group he added: ‘ I want you to force our politicians, who have questionable ideas about Brexit.
We call the world's society as part of a war that fought against us in the matter of Brexit and we will not rest until we become the United Kingdom independent, free and proud.
In the meantime, the struggle to become a member of the EU led on through Birmingham before attending a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several opposers have raised posters that Pope Brexit set up this week.
The convention had opened up to a friend of the Lord Adonis Institute who had mocked the Conservatives in the matter of the security that they had experienced with their computer program.
These are people who tell us that they have been able to establish the IT system in the country and all of Canada in addition to, unannounced borders, free trade in Ireland, have added.
‘ It’s a complete smile.
No better than Brexit, he added.

Russian Grand Price: Lewis Hamilton has the grand privilege of winning the world cup of victory over Sebastian Vettel according to the rules of the film
It was clearly evident that Vashti Bottas had defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday on the other side so that Mercedes’s rules would have a place in all the final stages.
Right from the start, Bottas started the sporting event well, and Hamilton had no success in all the two classes and invited Vettel to compete with his team partner.
Vettel took the lead in the competitions that left Hamilton behind, failing to succeed.
Mercedes came later and got out of the back of Vettel, but Hamilton continued after driving the wheels that had enabled the driver Ferrari to get free from the danger behind to protect the third.
Max Vertappen began from behind the pace and was the seventh at the end of the first day of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large section of the race where he grabbed his tires to complete with a four - time chance and found Kimi Raikkinon.
Later he came to a preparation place at 44 feet but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight feet while Rainkonen took the fourth.
It was a very difficult day because Valteri worked well on the weekend and was very honest.
The team has done a very special job to have two supercompetences, ” says Hamilton.
This Was Not the Right Way to Speak With Body Signs
President Donald Trump had insulted Sennacherib Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting for insisting that he had not issued a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to accuse the Chosen Court of Brett Kavanauugh of sexual immorality.
In a speech at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the evidence given by the Ford before the Senate Committee, but said that what is going on in Senate is proving that people are ‘ cruel and fierce and false."
"One of the best things that can happen in the past few days in the Senate is that you see anger, you will see people fierce and angry and fearful and lying," said he.
"Look at the hidden article from the detective, but you hear it saying "iii, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this.
Do You Recall?
Did you get it out?
After considering their response..., did you clear out - and - out - of - the - nothing, what, yes, what?
No, indeed.
I didn't go out in public.
Well, let us say.
We brought them out in public?... No, I am not us," he added to the Trump talk, which shows clearly that he is talking about the Internet.
A Feinstein was sent in a letter to explain the details of Kavanauugh's case against the Ford in the past July, and the article was publicly published in September - but the Feinsteins refused to admit that it had come from their office.
"I didn't hide anything on the subject that was brought up by Ford, I didn't broadcast it publicly," the Feinsstein reported to the Senetian Committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
"They told me it's a mystery and I have kept a secret."
Such resistance did not please the head of the country, who spoke in a conference on Saturday like this: "I assure you, this was not a good way to speak with physical gestures.
They may not have done so, but it was the foul way to speak with the body signals I have seen.
In defense of the applicants ’ judgment, who are accused of sexual immorality with three women, the president maintained that Democrats were using them to achieve their own ends.
"Their purpose is to restore energy by any means.
You can see that these people are really fearful, cruel, and indifferent to the victim’s desire for power, ” said the leader, according to the Media newspaper.
Main cup: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer drank two of the Giants ’ clubs against Dundee
The Dundee Stars gave way to the abuse of the Belfast Giant team and 5 to 3 out of 3 games in their previous Western stadium.
At the start of the “Belfast Giant ” show, two of these were shown by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
The Dundee team, however, replaced the two sticks with Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, and Dwyer of the Belfast Giants team, led the small group.
Francois Bouchard attached a bar to a collusion and then Lus Lundvald Nielsen with two of the cheeries that brought victory to the Dundee Stars.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the period for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to hit Dundee 2-1 at Belfast Friday night.
It was the fourth of these teams, and then the Giant team won the previous three games.
The first Dwyer’s attack came in a four - minute walk through Kendall McFaull, a second from Beauvillier, just four minutes after the initial siege.
It was a very busy opening, when Sullivan returned the athletes to the building at 13: 10, Matt Marquardt before giving Cownie a crucial opportunity that made the tigers the same catch at 15: 16.
Dwyer encouraged the Giants to take his first break when he struck his second match at the end of the first night.
The Dundee team, also at home, came with other ideas, and Bouchard had a powerful ensign at 2737 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran had skillfully played a ball for Nielsen who had drunk the Dundee bar that had led the tiger for the first time to the end of the second section and had added a drink that brought all the brides to the five games.
The Giants, who have now played four games in five successive games, are preparing to meet Milton Keynes on the coming Friday.

We prepared helicopters from Barimambapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a good hospital in another city.
Sadly, she died this morning before she arrived in Pallu.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
In the meantime, officials fear that deaths will cease to reach thousands of people in the country’s disaster - prone branches claiming that it is difficult to reach the towns of Dontitria, Sig, and Bouting.
"The number of those who die is believed to be rising while other bodies are still under the garbage and many are not included to see if they are still alive," says Professor Sutopo Pyo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] in height have devastated civilization and will be the funeral of all those who have died on Sunday.

The company may be composed of people with varying degrees of experience — perhaps about the age of a young man or some other country in which they live.
The crews in the area had been involved in rescue of the crew as soon as it fell into the water when it was supposed to be docked at Chuuk Island airport.
Some authorities have announced that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers had not yet been released from the Saturday hospital, but they were all in good health.

Experts list the symptoms of a mother’s burning to the point of no return
The prosecutor finally appealed the case on Saturday, accusing Mississippi’s wife of burning in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for many hours as an expert witness on tactful research.
He explained the court's use of cell phones to involve the conduct of 29-year - old Quinton Tellis and 19 - year- old beaten, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he had received much about the location from a number of handphones he showed that Tellis had Chambers the night before he died, in contrast with what he had said before, Clarion Ledger said.
When he was shown that his phone had Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk with Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday was not a town that day.
When the judges asked if Tellis was correct when they said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said, ‘ He is lying, because my car was in Nashville right away. ’
Another difference was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after death.
Evidence from handphones indicates that they meet each other for a week.
Rowlett says that shortly after Chammers ’ death, Tellis removed Chammer’s writings, much of the music with his name on his phone.
"Adam put it out of his life," said Hare.
The opposer is expected to present his final Sunday opposition.
The judge said that he was expecting the trial to take place that very day.

A black man!
A NY child - care provider blames one family for sending a message of " racism"
A NY child carer blames another family for sending a message of prejudice after receiving a lost message from the mother complaining that she was a "one black man."
The family refuses to recognize that they are prejudiced, saying that the crime is like "a way of stealing."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed frustration upon learning that this new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day to work in 2016.
"YIIIIIIIII IS ONE OF DADA," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmanto in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending the letter to her husband, she sent to Mama Maurice twice.
Recognizing his error, the "unsetrs" Plasco-Flaxm resigned Sister Maurice, saying that she had been the guardian of their children, who was an African-American, had worked at it and was rather hoping to find a person from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid a day’s wage and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice now charges against the couple for payment of her pension, and she wants to be paid $350 a day for the six - month contract before the concert work she had been doing.
"I want to show them, you see, you don't do things this way," he told the Post Friday and added "I know it's prejudice."
She defended herself against the claim that she was prejudiced, saying that Maurice was the wise thing to do, fearing that she would not trust her if she stumbled.
"My wife sent her something that she doesn't want to say.
He is not partial.
We are not prejudiced," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you put your children into the hands of someone whom you have been afraid of, even if it wasn't deliberate?
Your new child?
You people.
Comparing the case to the "declaration of theft," Plasco said that his wife was only two months old to have a child and was in "the most difficult time."
"Can you get out to fight someone who is in that situation?
It is not the best thing to do," a banker added.
While the case is still in effect, the public prosecutor’s office has enthusiastically denounced the family in Media and condemned them for their actions and attitudes.
The publishers of Paddington's book fear that readers cannot imagine a speaking bear, a new letter reveals this.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was enrolled after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's difficult to replace someone who reads the book before the release.
It is exciting to know now what we know about this great success of Paddington's book."
Regarding his father, an ancient BBC artist was urged to write a book for children and a young doll, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of these books was a ‘ painful and pleasant' after his death last year.
Paddington's book, which is described as "the most important in our family," adds that his father was very proud that he did well in the end.
"He was a mild person, and was not a bad person," he said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you are proud of them even though you are not.
I think he had seen Paddington’s success this way.
Despite his achievements and opinions, he always accords the owner Paddington's honor.
My daughter was dying, and I was on the phone to shut the door
There she ran with her daughter to the Nice Louis Pasteur hospital, where doctors had worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call frequently to say that it was really dangerous, and that she didn't expect to be healed," says Ednan-Lapehouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad that she would die within two minutes and I had to get her down.
And I did.
I said, ‘ Tashi, I love you, my dear one.
I will be with you in the near future.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the drugs gave her to pumping her heart was slowly coming out and eliminating her body.
He had been dead for only a short time.
I had to wait and wait, knowing that all of this was going to happen.
I cannot cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and others.
I had to keep it by myself.
Later, Mrs. Ednan-Lapehouse, still grieving the death of her daughter, took a plane with other non-conscious people.
"No one knows that," she said.
"My head was on the floor, and tears were falling all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but I had to feel sorry for Nad.
That they wanted my love and understanding.
I knew how much they loved me.
A sad mother sends cards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two mothers who have lost a loved one in death attempting to end their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards on the Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers for help.
Tyler, Sister Davis ’ son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear how I feel from day to day," he said.
A 45 - year - old woman in Lydney commented that her son had the privilege of being a good cook, and they had a good sense of humor.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
It is always said that its smile reflects any place.
However, she had quit her job before she died, since she was under great pressure.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, had met his brother after he committed suicide.
“ I’m worried that there’s a good outcome, ” says Mrs. Davis.
Sister Davis made the cards, "In order for people to know that there are people outside where you can go and you can talk to them, even to friends.
Don't just sit back and talk.'
She had been a lifelong friend of Mother Davies, and her 15 - year - old friend Mark had died not long after his mother’s death.
"She didn't say she felt hurt or sad or anything," she said.
"Several days before Christmas, we saw how it changed.
It wasn't much better on Christmas Day when they opened their gifts without looking at them or saying anything about them.
He also said that his death was very serious, but he had to endure in the following: "It left family suffering very much.
They separate us.
But we all need to keep enduring."

The future of Brett Kavanauugh is uncertain when the FBI begins investigating
"I thought, if we found anything such as a short - term survey, a small one on the average, we could bring a little one," Flake said on Saturday, he added that he feared the committee was ‘ falling" during a full political battle.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is a result of what was about to happen.
The middle elections are five weeks to be made, on November 6 -mito, as expected, when the Republican party has failed, and it will be too weak to attempt to bring the person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking a telephone call to sing the Senete people, encouraging them to assist the Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush and through him, Bush met Ashley, their author.
What will happen after the FBI release its report?
There will be a vote in Senate, with 51 stickers of the Republic and 49 members of the Democratic Party.
It is not known whether the Kavanaugh won at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the second president, to settle the case and convince him in the High Court.
The number of rebels has been "lowed" by Kim
The number of people who come from North Korea to become South Korea has dropped since the seven years ago, South Korea’s lawmaker, Kim Jong-un.
A Park Ibyong-seug, speaking of much from the South ministry of the minister of relations, said there were 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the better management of the border between North Korea and China and the higher prices that the traffickers pay are due to this decline.
Pyongs said nothing about it.
Most of the rebels from North Korea are eventually granted entry into South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed unauthorized limits since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has a long border with North Korea and is much easier to cross than the DMZ DMZ’s DMZ.
Another considers these rebels to be displaced rather than run away and is often forced to take revenge.
The relationship between North and South Korea that has been very different in recent months has changed.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyonging to discuss the nuclear weapons that had failed in the past.
This was after the special June convention between the U.S. President of the Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, while the two agreed to work to destroy all the nuclear weapons in their Korean countries.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that discipline from the U.S.
"Unless we believe that the United States will not be satisfied with the security of our country and in these things it is impossible for us to give up the use of nuclear weapons alone," says RI in addressing the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelolisi calls Brett Kavanaugh, saying that he is not qualified to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader with a few members of the committee Nancy Pelolisi is elected at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanauugh and said that he did not have the ability to work in the High Court.
Those words are part of a conversation that took place on Saturday in Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't do anything else, but I think that if a woman had done this, she would have said, 'So in giving her opinion on what Kavanaugh would say as a witness before the Fourth Senate Committee.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that she had raped Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were all young.
In her opening words, Kavanaugh was very upset, sometimes screaming and yelling at her family and her high school time.
He also denounced the Democrats on the committee, saying that the charges against him were "difficulty and racking" prepared by freemen who were upset that Hillary Clinton had not won the 2016 election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s evidence had confirmed that she should not work in the Supreme Court, since it was proved to be favoring the Democrats party.
"I think they are evasive by what they say and how they speak to Clintons and Democrats," said.
Pelos were asked if they would try to remove the Kavanauugh by vote, and if the Democrats had found many members in the Oingira home.
"What I would say is that if he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't have to be in the Supreme Court, but to be on the scene where he is here, he said, "So it's.
Kavanaough is still a judge at the DC Curcuit Court of Appeals.
Pelos added that if a member of the Democrat were concerned with decisions that Kavanauough would disagree with the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, he is viewed as a political lawyer for the Democrat.
In his favorable response, the Kavanaugh refused to question whether he could change some decisions to the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a person who is partial, to go to court and wait for us to say, 'This is not so bad,' said Pelos.
And women should take advantage of it.
With that righteous reproof, months and years of fury are going forth, and they will not lift up crying in gladness.
"We cry when we're angry," Sister Stein told me this some 45 years later.
"I don't think it's strange, isn't it?"
She continued, "I was especially helped by an older woman who said that she was upset, but she made a plan to say to the person she was talking to, "You can think that I’m sorry because I cry."
I'm angry.
And she still works.
And I think it was a good idea.
Tears are allowed to flow because tears are not fully understood.
One of my best memories of my first career was in the office with a number of men, where I was once found crying in a fit of rage, was my constant arrest by a mild - tempered lady with whom I was always afraid of going up the stairs.
"Don't let these people see you cry," he told me to do so.
"I don't know that you're upset.
They think you are sad and happy that they are coming to you.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congress in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his campaign as president.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in adultery after he boarded a ship called Monkey Business that led him to quit the race, Schroede, greatly disappointed, felt that there was no reason for him to take part in a contest as president.
"He didn't choose correctly, "He told me and laughed at me 30 years later."
"There were already seven others who wanted to enter the race, and the last thing they needed was one person.
One of them called them " Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was a sudden campaign, she was in the back of making money, and she was determined not to share in the race unless she had earned $2 million.
This was a failure.
They found that some of the helpers who gave $1,000 to the men should give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discharge?" they were surprised.
When he announced that he did not set a real campaign, he was deeply moved by his gratitude for those who helped him, being disappointed by the provision of material provisions that made it difficult to obtain money and to deal with voters rather than voters, and being angry over being left to cry.
"If you thought I was in serious trouble," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media dealt with her.
"You thought Klenee was my company’s assistant.
I remember thinking, What will he put on my gravestone?
"She cried"?"
Light came on how China could benefit from the Cold War.
In the meantime, the struggle continued for a good name and was a major source of both emotional and physical violence.
The beginning of this came when the American leader, Donald Trump, set up taxes on goods from China, such as solar power tools, various metals, including aluminum.
The conflict seemed to reach its climax this week when the American nation decreed that as much as 200 billion dollars ’ worth of property would be added to or more than 150 billion dollars in Britain.
China, in turn, has been returning to the United States with its tax returns to the United States, recently imposed between 15 percent of its taxes and the cost of 60 billion dollars ’ worth of property.
The country has declared that the abuse will follow American policy and will be controlled by it.
In order for the United States to abandon the practice, it would be necessary for the goods of China to be reduced to less expensive and more seductive in the Americas than it would in any other country — to bring reproach on its ruler, Jinping.
However, some experts believe that the papyrus may have helped China for a long time to reduce the security of the two countries, which would be possible if the country had made a good choice.
"Abgail Grace, who works with the Center for New America Security, and research expert on Asian countries, says that ‘ active political issues have a more serious impact on economic activity in the Americas and China than some think....
Syria is "ready" for the refugees to return, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that he is ready to return to the refugees and that he asks for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed in a period of over seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al - Moulem said that things are getting better in the world.
"So far things have been settled and safe because of what has been done against terrorism," she said.
The government will continue to repair the damage caused by terrorism.
All things are now settled for refugees to leave behind a world of terrorism and economic practices that have affected their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million people in Syria had fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million others live there in need of help.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian government would receive help in rebuilding this devastated land.
But he claimed that he could not receive help with other needs or assistance from countries that had helped the rebels.
A European team has taken a cup of rap Cup in Paris
The European team has taken the dyder Cup cup of 2018 after winning the USA team with 16 and a half-pounders of Le Golde National parade, outside Paris, France.
The American nation has been surrendering to the Ruder Cup’s six - year - long drama that has been played in the European countries since 1993.
The team of air - conditioners named Thomas Bjorn took the cup a few times after winning 14.5 in order to defeat a U.S. soccer team.
The U.S. team expert Philip Mickelson, who failed to show a man on the contest, had thrown a ball into a ball in a wrong way that caused his enemy Francesco Molinari to get a bullake over them.
The Italian players had played an impressive game in all the games and made him 1 of the 4 players who had completed 5-0 since the game in 1979.
American athletes, Jordan Spieth, were not satisfied when they gave in to 5 cents of European players Forbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who did not reach the highest level of academic achievement.
The world’s best - known player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the English Ian Poulter who probably played his final game in the Rylar Cup cup.
Lyder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has been the most successful athlete in Europe.
"I don't cry, but I can't do it right now.
This was a very difficult year.
I am grateful to my teacher Thomas for believing me.
I am very happy, and I am glad to have received this cup again.
The goal was to win our team. I am glad that I have participated in this victory, ” said Garcia, who looks very interested in the success of his European team.
He commended John Ram's fellow citizens who had won the US Tiger Woods 2&1 on a weekly game.
"I’m most proud of winning Tiger Woods, where I grow up and watch him play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods had won all four performances in France and is now successful in the Ruder Cup competition that reached 13-21-3.
This is shocking in the view that this is one of the world's greatest academics, who won 14 contests and won only Jack Nicklaus.
The USA had struggled at the end of a week to achieve good results except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played the top score in all the games.
The U.S. director of the U.S. president Jim Furryk spoke after a shocking game in his team, "I’m proud of the boys, he's working hard.
There was a time in the morning when we had troubled a European team.
We fought in several battles.
All the respect Thomas showed was due to be accorded.
He is in the very best position to guide you.
All 12 players have been given a very good game.
We will be able to make more adjustments, and I will be able to work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and make progress.
I love all 12 of my friends and am proud to be their leader.
We can say that it makes a difference.
Let's admit that our friends played better than we did.
More Red Waves: The decline in Pinellas, Manatetes, and Sarasota
A recent report from the Pharmacy and Wildlife Commission in Florida shows a serious decrease in the number of Red Tide in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, red tides are located in the area of Pinellas, Manatetes, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier — which indicates a reduction in population.
The eruption of the Red Sea extends about 130 miles [130 km] of coastline from north Pinellas to south of Lee.
The sections are also about 10 square miles [10 sq km] up the Hillsborough County, but in less space than the next week.
Red tides were also visible on the Pasco County.
The increase in the size of the Pinellas County was reported last week, a small increase and higher elevation of the Hillsborough County, the nearest and large area of the Manatee County, the nearest and larger in the area of Sarasota County, the smaller and closer the Charlotte County, the nearest and larger size of Lee County, and the smaller size of the Collier County.
The respiratory problem continues to be mentioned in the towns of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
The respiratory problem is not addressed in North Florida on the same weekend.
