Members of the Welsh assembly (AMS) are concerned about looking foolish
There are Amss who are concerned because it is raised for a change to MWPs (Central Parliament of Wales).
This has been done because of plans to change the name of the convention into Parliament of Wales.
The Ams in all politics is concerned that this will contribute to their increase.
One Labour Am is concerned that the new term is close to the terms "Twp" and Pwp."
To a nonsmoking reader in Wales: Welsh tthp means a fool and opwp means a tsetse.
The AM of Wales organization said that the whole association does not like this, and it has recommended in other words.
A member of the Cancer Group in Wales claims that his group has no problem with the change of name, but he has found it easy to call MWP by the way he calls the fool.
In this case the letter-w is pronounced in Welsh is the same as the English letter.
The Assembly, busy with the organizing of a new term, said: "The decision of how to call members of the Assembly shall be taken by the members themselves.."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh convention permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of people's responses and found that the majority supported the assembly's change in terms of the Parliament of Wales.
In the matter of how to call Ams, the Commission prefers that members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the people support this MWP.
Ams is said to offer alternative advice, but the fact that it is difficult to agree on this matter must be a problem for Elin Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to make a law change in the following weeks.
This amendment will include other changes in the organization, such as how the assembly functions, including the amms stops and the committee is composed.
Anams votes that will finally count when the law is discussed in the question of how to be called.
The Macedonians will vote to change their country’s name
The voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country to "Northern Macedonia Republic."
The vote is for a solution to a decade - long conflict between Greece and the province of Macedonia.
The Athenians have long claimed that the name of their neighbors of the north is a matter of concern in their area, and they have long challenged their request to be members of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to this change of name, said that he would not be interested in the vote.
However, supporters of the vote, including Chief Chief Zran Zaev, say that the change of the name is the price required to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin Is Not beaten as They Strate the Churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The older people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them."
You might ask why barley came so easily.
He said: ‘ People will have another form of entertainment" these days.
"Bari is no longer a place in the neighborhood where people regularly go."
He is concerned about the churches because he believes that the money he has obtained from selling his goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to their original position."
In addition, churches can be replaced by man - made roofs that will never help maintain the remaining local shrines.
He said, "Many people who buy these cards are white. So the day will soon come when the churches will be closed, because it doesn't seem as though the people who have moved them are not members of the churches."
Both of these churches were white churches before Harlem became the place of black, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist congregation was formed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation he served nearby became one that was built up.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Flood. John Howard Johnson, who led a salesperson at 125th Street, the best street on Harlem, was against unemployment and not supported by blackmen.
In 1839 the building was severely damaged by fire, but as the members of the Port' Johnson were preparing to rebuild it, they were ordered to be struck with iron.
The bull. David Johnson, son and successor of Tat' Johnson in St. Martin's.
The man who mastered the instrument, and who beat it, called it in another way: "The wealth of culture" and "a tool of history can't be replaced."
This specialist, Tiffany Ngn, of the University of Michigan, also said that for the first time, the instrument was played by a black performer, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the great Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merwether said St. Martin's has not replaced him.
The main thing here was St. Martin's in the last few months was the artisans and architects, some of whom were named by non-bal church leaders, others by the Rabe church.
The Council of State, composed of non - ecclesiastical leaders, wrote to an apologist in July, concerned that the looter would be responsible for the congregation, even though he had nothing to do with the employment of architects and architects sent by the conspiracy.
Some churchgoers complain that the sage does not keep the matter to himself.
Krebe can help a child with 13-year drunk access to lobsters in California
The officers, the shark has attacked and helped a 13-year boy on Saturday, when he sank to catch a lobster in California on the day he was opening for a lobster catcher.
This attack occurred just before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. They went to him to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought he was happy to hold a lobster, but later he realized that he shouted, ‘ I’m cut!'
‘ I was crushed!'
The lower part of the neck is all over the chest," Hammel has noticed this when he comes to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'
The boy is flown to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in a serious state.
It is not known which type of sharks are left behind.
Seagull, Captain Lapland. Larry Giles said that when speaking on the news, shark has been seen there in the past weeks, but it has been said that it is not a dangerous form of shark.

The authorities have shut down the sea from the Ponto Beach in Casabbled to Swami's Ekinitas for 48 hours to make sure of safety.
Miles reported that there are more than 35 species of sharks in the area, but most are said to be safe.
Sainsbury's plan to bring its products to the UK fuel market
Sainsbury's competition with the Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams by having stores with oil and specialized people to help people.
As an important way to enter the UK oil market that makes up as much as £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household products are declining, the supertankers will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and will be present in more stores the next year to run well.
Investment of cosmetics has been created because these stores need to use empty shelves after being charged with TV, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's will double its content to 3,000, including names like Revlon, Essie, Tezerman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Those already having L'Oral, Malbelline, and Burt's Bees will have more space to place them in places with names like those found in Bbats.
The store will also announce Boutique products so that most of them will be suitable for non-eaters' demands by new customers.
Also, the spice merchant Fraser Shop will examine the requirements of two stores of Saninsbury, the first opened at Croydon, south of London, the last week and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, in Birmingham, in the course of a year.
On the Internet and even if people buy small meals a day at a nearby store, this requires that large stores do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, director of the Sainsbury's department, said that these stores will look like big stores with different products, as they are trying to fight the more expensive stores of the Aldi and Lidl through more services and other non-food products.
The Sainsbury's place the Argos on several stores and has started with the Hatitats because it bought them both two years ago. This has increased food prices and has made them profitable.
Efforts to improve the oil and medicinal branches have fallen.
The Sainsbury's tried to meet the Bits in the early part of the 2000s, but they broke apart after fighting in a way that would divide the market for medicine at its stores.
This new strategy arose after the Sainsbury's sold Calesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, its 281 medical market by £125m, over the last three years.
Lloyds is also going to share this plan, by increasing the quality of the tucking products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy at four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, manager of commerce at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of the passage with our makeup to improve our customers.
We have lent money to our employers, especially to those who have been trained in the field ministry so that they can offer advice.
The various products we have are designed to be suited for every need, making one look for a place where it is readily available, is now an attractive place of cosmetics and that is not very similar to the old buying.
Peter Jones's voice 'because Holly Willoughby stopped £11million
Peter Jones, well - known in the Dragons Den, went on “profitly ” after Producor Holoughby stopped the £11million industry industry to deal with the new agreements he had with Mars and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their production of household materials, such as Truly.
This second business has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The driver of the This Morning System, which is 37, put it in Instagram that you are traveling.
Holly Wiloughby has left a reputation in Dragons' Den, Peter Jones is upset because he has come out at the last minute on the road to life - so that he can take good care of his new connections with Mars & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones has been “proneful ” when an important girl on TV admits at a warm meeting on Tuesday at her shopping center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, if her new agreements - reaching £1.5 million - she has little time to take care of household products and decorations like Truly.
This business is compared to the production Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and had earned twice as much as Willoughby's money estimated to be at £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, introduced to Instagram that he left Truly, Jones moved to one of his homes in Britain on vacation.
The source said: "Truly was the most important thing to Holly.
It is because it is his long - term future over the next ten years.
His decision to leave him, she left everyone in a state of shock.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, near the time of the commemoration.
There is a restaurant full of goods in the Marlow HQ ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of a This Morning announcer, one of Britain's most profitable, can consume millions of companies because of the heavy investment from the main sources and candles to the goods and household items, and things that may be even more disturbing to its establishment.
And this could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go together on vacation and Jones has 40 percent assignments to the Baldwin's TV company.

We said ‘ love one another'
He was criticized for the criticism of the media by saying what some considered to be a ‘ efficiency ’ and speaking well of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make such sacrifices?
Trump said with his embarrassing tone of "I was a reporter on the system".
"I didn't sacrifice anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting them again after their first encounter in Singapore in June that the Trump was awarded as a major step toward nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the question of nuclear disarmament has come to an end.
More than three months after the June convention in Singapore, North Korea’s top ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the House of the Law that North sees no ‘ the same answer ’ from the United States to North Korea for arms disarmament movements.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its program of oppression.
Trump has given hope in the speech he gave at his feast.
"We're doing well with North Korea," said.
‘ We fought against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we're very close.
He said that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim and with the good results that were no longer being tested, resulting in the release of American soldiers who had been arrested and returned to the bones of the American army.
And he has protected her from using unusual means of communicating with Kim.
"It is very easy for the presidents, rather than for the 10,000 outsiders who are trying to enter the full stadium, we could have about 200 people standing here," who said, ‘ Mr. Trump pointed to a single standing crowd before him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and the Snow, destroying an island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they did not need.
Even though 10 percent of the Lombok people have been removed from the area, the area has not been declared a disaster area, which would have caused world support.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they have made it clear that they do not ask the world for help, so this is a challenge, ” said Nszn Sumung.
While the Save the Children is joining a group to go to Palu, there is little doubt that foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian officials are investigating the situation in Pulu to see if the world’s institutions would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of an earthquake that often reaches Indonesia, the country is not always so well prepared for an earthquake.
While tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are rare in some coastal areas.
The absence of the tsunami warning in Palu, although warned of this, may have contributed to human death.
Even in times of surprise, travel between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel more difficult.
A hospital ship arrived in Lombok to treat quake victims to Pulu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widdo laid the groundwork for improving the foundations of the dying Indonesian development of elections, and he has spent a lot of money in repairing roads and railways.
But lack of financial support has caused the government of Mr.
And Mr. Jokko is faced with the tension of ethnic strife in Indonesia, where most Muslim members have entered the main part of the service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim factions fight the streets with clubs, guns, and knives, as well as with other dangerous weapons.

Cromwell’s portrait is the last to be found by a conflict of ‘ recopying of history ’
Their removal will be a universal righteousness because of its destruction similar to that of Tabban in the endless number of native and religious images of England by his devout Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell described Mr Crick's advice as "foolishness" and " trying to rewrite history."
] John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would be inevitable that in this conversation there is the removal of images for the image of the Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster to be a victim.
The destruction of images in English wars was neither ordered nor invented by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell will be surrendered to him because of the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the first century.
The famous way Sir William Hamo Thornecroft described Cromwell is evidence of 19th- century views and part of the history of many people who still feel that his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many more, probably in the latter part of the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defense against outside pressure, particularly in his case of pressure from the king.
Even if this method of creation is completely accurate, it depends upon the debate of the continuing history.
There is no doubt that the conflicts that existed in the mid-17th century have affected the development of our country the next time, and Cromwell is a man who has revealed one side of the conflict.
What he does as Lord of Armies must be observed and remembered."
A Deadly Rack That Kills a Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked by a hen in a market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man, described only by his surname "Yuan," was found to have a broken vein, covered with blood near the pigs in Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer plans to harvest his pigs on May 30, 2005, at Chining Province of Qinghai, China.
He was said to have been taking his cousin away from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found that the door leading to a nearby herd of pigs was open.
He says that there was a large bull with blood in his mouth.
An investigation of the square confirmed that the hag was 550 pounds and killed the mother, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and turned," said the cousin named "Wu," as quoted by Guiging Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a Thursday for feeding the pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The hapless lion killed Yuan not his own or his cousin.
The store manager told the Exchange News that the thief had been locked so as not to attack other people, while the police had gathered evidence in the area.
the family of Yuan and the market authorities are said to talk about the payment of his death.
Although rare, the condition where pigs are recorded in earlier attacks is not uncommon.
In 2016, the cock attacked a caneman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, a man who suffered serious injury.
In the last ten years, the more than 650 heavy hens caught a Welsh farmer in telekhthar until his wife expelled him.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told the CBC News that the pigs did not seem to be aggressive but their blood intake could make them so.
It’s just a game.
They are, they are very strict,... with no intention of harming you.

There are more than 20 million people who have watched the positive testimony of the fourth-century before the Supreme Court’s choice of Brett Kavanauugh and the sophist who accused her of sexual abuse in the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six TV shows.
At the same time, the political state continues, with a press that interferes with the design of the fifth-rate system to change at the last minute: an agreement by Sen of Arizona by Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one- week trial.
Ford told the Senate Committee to make sure of 100 percent that Kavanaugh had put his finger under the influence of alcohol and tried to free him of clothing from a high school party.

It is not uncommon for more than 20.4 million people to watch Nelson's report on Friday.
The company listed the number of followers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC news.
The figures were not present at this time so that they could be visible to other networks, including PCS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And unielsen has a limited capacity to measure the people who watch in the office.
To put it in this situation, the size of the followers is the same as when the final watch is observed in a soccer game or in the Study Mass.
The Department of News, with the view that they have a system supporting the election of Kavanauugh, led all the others to the network by having followers at a level of 5.69 million at the time of counsel all day long, reports Nielsen.
ABC was in the second place with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million million and CNN had 22,52 million, as told by Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the counsel is given.
Flake was the first to be featured on the Friday drama
After the Central Riphabshiki office released a voter to vote Kavanaugh, she was found by CNN and CBS Cameras on Friday morning as she was trying to climb the sft to the counsel of the Executive Committee.

"I am standing here before you," said the man of confusion.
"Do you think you are telling the truth in the country?
He was told, "You are strong when most of the sailors are powerless."
Flake said that her office had taken out the platform and that before the end of the chart, there was much she could say to the counsel committee.
the distribution network and the tables all distributed at once in the following hours, while the Executive Committee would vote to further the election of Kavanaugh in full election.
But Flake said that he would do so only by consulting the FBI in which he would look for charges against the choice of the next week, where a few Democrats were advised.
Flake has recommended that she speak with her relative, Democratic neator Chris Coos.
After discussing with Coons and other setors, Flake decided.
Flake’s choice is powerful, for there is evidence that the Riphabshikis do not decide to accept Kavanauh without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation to investigate the charges made by Kavanaugh.

Their play style and control has not always changed what they have returned from a standard aircraft, but the credit is given to Holt in the way he has played the team game that he has come to.
He had a number of valiant men.
The gang leader Halkett had the body, which is a member of the Superbly-consoling system, while Menga kept the signatures of Onor Goldson and Joe Worral all the time.
The Ringers needed encouragement.
Even though they had some good performances under Gerard, they had fallen far from these standards.

U.S. has repeated A.I financial support.
China has become more active in non-movable Chief, the U.S., to repeat the time spent in the research section, says the sponsor and AI Procationer Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These entities come after various parts of the U.S. government have made declarations of the AI, as well as the U.S.
In the meantime, China announced its plan this past year: it was intended to be No.1 in the AI design in 2030.
"Repetition of AI research budget will be a good start, as all other countries beyond the U.S., and we look into the next AI project," says Lee.
Repeating support may double the chances of the next major AI success that will be performed in the U.S., said Lee in a interview with CNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "Great Power of AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, EO of the Sivonion Ventures, sponsored one of the largest AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980 ’ s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon worked on an AI system that struck the most high - ranking American man Othello Player, who was later the head of the Microsoft Research Committee, and who was then the president of Google at the Chinese branch.
Lee has accepted the previous competition for U.S. government government government technology as the Role of the Lobhot Project for the High Security Committee and asked when it would come next, to determine the following criteria.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to win government financial support, reports Lee.
"It's not China to take the leadings of education; it's the joint organisations, Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technical firms have hired university professionals to work in AI in these recent years.
Lee said that the change of international travel may help to support their AI efforts
"I think the green card will be automatically given to those who make PhDs in AI," says the.

Early this year the U.S. Security section established the Administrative Center for Non-Britation, which was intended to include groups working together from product to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the election of a non-matter Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion savings as the beginning of a test called the Followive AI.
Since NSF, she now has more than $100 million savings a year and is prepared for investigations in AI.
At present, the U.S. law intended to create the National Security Council in Non-Nativity has not yet been established in these months.
The Macedonians decided on the defexum to change the name of their country.
The Macedonians have decided on the dexendum Sunday to change the name of the country to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia," an action that will resolve the old ten-year-old dispute that members will call the values in the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, requires that its neighbor in the Northern Hemisphere be represented by a controversy in its territory and close the entrance to NATO and EU.
Two governments agreed in June on a request for a new name, but Nationalists object to the change of the term that undermines the origin and culture of most Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote for the deferendum and that a contract order to work together is not sure that the voters can meet the requirements of a minimum 50 percent required to carry out the approved refendum choice.
The question in the draft board of the fefendum reads: "May you be a member of the NATO and EU who accepts a Greek agreement."
The supporters of the word change, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, contends that the price paid is worth in order to be accepted on such sites as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, which are one of the countries to meet in the Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of this world, making new people here in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, for that will mean a safe life for all of us, says Olivera Georgijovska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, members of the parliament are said to lend themselves to the outcome of the vote so as to make it necessary.[2]
The change of the name will require a second and a third in the parliament.
The national election commission said that there were no unusual reports on 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, the people present stood at 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the previous 2016 election in which 6 percent of voters were voted.
"Here I am going to vote for my children, our place in Eurpe," said Gjose Tanevski, which has 62, and was to vote in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko elected a conferendum in Macedonia for a change of name to open the way to join NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before a parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, with 54, set up a small platform and pushed himself in front of the tent the seats that were set up by those who were against the rafurum.
"We're both NATO and EU, but we want to join seriously, not according to door services" said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor, but we are virtuous.
If they do not want to accept it as Macedonia, we can convert such countries as China and Russia into part of the European-Assyrian Union."
The Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much - needed cash crops to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will like it because more than 80 percent of the population love Nato and the EU," says Zaeve after election in a bridge.
He said that "yes" will be the result of "affirming our future."
A list of voters will be published in the last Monday by the Macedonian National Police Service Center between 30 and 43 percent of voters who will participate in the fefrundum- below is the number required for the election to be successful.
One list of voters, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, was found to 57 percent of the people who planned to vote on Sunday.
In the month, 70 percent said they would vote for you "yes."
For the election of the flumlum to be successful, it would require that 50 percent of the votes be won and one person over.
The failure of the condom will cause the first powerful blow to the pro-Western government police since their taking cables in May last year.

Trump’s Lisels in West Virginia
The President points directly to the situation surrounding the person he selected in the High Court, Brett Kavanauugh while speaking about the importance of the release of the Republican election by the medieval choice.
‘ Everything we have done can be lost in November.
Five weeks remain before the final selection of history and the most important of our time.
This choice is big, big <I run and really do not run away with this is what I am running around everywhere trying to find suitable people, say.
Trump went on to say, "You see the bad things, the bad things of the violent Democrats, you see happening at this moment.
And he is willing to accept the power of control by any means that he considers appropriate, cruel, unfeeling.
They don't care who has hurt them, who will go above him, to receive power and authority, and only what they need in power, we will not give them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "for opposition and disturbance."
"You have also seen what is happening in the last four days," say, calling Democrats "out of anger and in bitterness and insensibleness."

Ah, Ah, what.
No, Oh no, I expect another – this was bad about the body-of-body as bad as I've never seen."
Labour is no longer a local church.
It is difficult to put into practice what these are thinking
While Momentum's activists in my local team decided to oppose me, it was strange.
After all of this, I am the first one in the Labour List to be told what they are thinking.
My fellow parliament partner, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment from me when he boldly stood firm against the Jews.
In my case, the situation of my criticism and opposition was to be avoided by Jeremy Corbyn.
In the important economic police station, the national security, Europe, by arranging similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with former leaderships.
The meeting announcement Notingham East Labor, which was based on the Chapter, wrote that "we want the meetings to be included and with good results."
During the nearly eight years that I was the Labour P in the community, the GC sessions on Friday have been very specific.
Where today's crisis exists, this modern meeting is not a regular feature of the meetings that we usually have "human and soft, low" politics has long been forgotten, however, to start again.
It seems to be a growing difference of ideas that are not accepted in the Labour team and that all the opinion is studied before being accepted into the zone.
This began after Jeremy entered the leadership seat, such as a fellow worker and I had previously thought of sharing a similar view of politics and expected me to turn it quickly and take the places I did not agree with; it would be to the security of the National or the security of one of the EU.
Whenever I speak out-and what I don't care about is followed by the harassment on the dialogue pages is said to be down the seat, not to accept the local politics, I am told I am not fit to join the Labour party.
And that is my experience.
Also, I know I am more fortunate than my fellow workers as the parliaments are brought directly to me and they want to be political.
I respect the art and determination of my colleagues who deal with sexual or racial harassment every day but cannot keep them away from me.
One of the most embarrassing aspects of this world’s politics is the degree of violence, which is the very nature of which it is now commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained the last week that the Labour team had adopted the culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we no longer are the larger church and in a "deboration of hope" or a change of the principles of a group that is inferior to them.
I have many suggestions over the past two years that I have asked to let me go, not to speak as I say and then, "It's all right."
But that’s not what I’ll do in politics.
Since I joined Labour in 32 years as a school child, being seduced by the Anglican government is not concerned about neglecting the room where I have been studying, since then I have vowed that I will fight for the best of the public's best and needed services, especially if I am a planman or a government official.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, as well as in the past.
None in the East Nottingham can be confused by any way about where I stand at my police station, and where I do not agree with current leaders.
In these conditions now raised by June, I can say in all cases that while Brexit has moved you to harm yourself in homes, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand his desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the head of the guard class.
But the truth is that the one message I have is not going to Nottingham Momentum, to my people, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am selfish about working under you and promise that no value of resignation or political help can prevent me from doing what I believe is your best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr moves ahead
The two later tigers are led toward the end of the course that is nearly leading to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of this great victory of the celebration of the Tenent's Premiership.
Now they raise the level, the most divided side.
Finally, it was their high - quality protection, as well as their opportunity to take advantage of a better opportunity, which resulted in the accuracy of the family side of Peter Murchie and the trainer Peter Murchie.
"We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we're not yet beaten, so I must be happy," she said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "To commend Ayr, do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson in his turn 14 minutes, changed by Franz Clili, and put Ayr ahead, but, with a Scottish map card, George Hughes, released the game, allowing Melrose to make the zeros and Jason Baggot to try to change them.
CULI suggested Ayr's leadership by purety, before, a half-hour play time, and then changed the course by 17-5 to Ayr during a break.
But the Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's cloth, translated by Baggot, reduced five points.
Ruriadedh Knott, who had been released by a parachute, has been said for a long time, and when the Ayr was born, it rose rapidly with the Stafford McDowall, translated by CLI.
Ayr captain Blair Macpharson has been given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose has fined another man for Bruce Colvine’s untransformed tract, under intense pressure.
However, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card because of setting Coli without a ball without the peralti line, MacPerson has gone to bed back as the Ayr watched.
CLI has changed, as nearly since the start of the reconstitution, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong’s balls into the box and sent a flag to Gregor Henry from a fifth tie.
The Still Game item appears to be committed to a new project in the section of the annual
Still Game partner Ford Kieran seems determined to the reception section after it has been discovered that he has been appointed head of an insurance company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, writing with another comic character Greg Hempill.
The two have already stated that a nine - part series will be the last one to conduct the show and that Kiernan is preparing to do something else after the Craiglang.
According to tradition records, he is the ruler of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The player has not been willing to note this article, although the Scottish Sun source has said thatKiernan wants to enter the "processing business" in Glasgow.
‘ Our Sea: Bolivia on earth hope that the road will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors watch over the masts of La Paz.
Public flag salutes the blue flag.
The seams from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon came down with the words: "Our official sea.
To find it again is our job.
Throughout Bolivia’s narrow world, the memory of the sea coast taken by Chile in the war of the Great War of the 19th century is still vivid in mind — as is the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the most lofty in centuries, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the world’s legal court on October 1 after five years of debate.
" Bolivia is strong, a spirit of unity and quiet, and waiting for a good spirit results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian ambassador.
Many citizens of Bolivia will listen to the ruling of the World Court of Justice to the highest courts in the country, hoping that the Hague court will take a stand on Bolivia’s grounds for decades after all confrontations and adjustments in Chile are required to consider giving Bolivia a beautiful place in the sea.
Evo Morales, a leading Bolivian president and a native native of the country who is facing a difficult battle to be selected the following year - also has much to do with this Monday judgment.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he confirmed as it said toward the end of August.
But some social commentators say that it is unlikely that a court - hearing on the side of Bolivia - chonto will change that.
The United Nations General Assembly on the Netherlands-has no power to release Chile's land, and it says that it will not be aware of the consequences of possible speech.
The fact that the judgment of the World Court of Justice was issued only six months after the review shows that the case was "unconventional, ” says Paz Zárate, a specialist in the country's law.
And instead of assisting with Bolivia’s wishes, four years may have taken a toll on it.
"The subject of sea access has been confiscated by the existing Bolivian government," says Zárate.
Morales ’ fight has brought an end to any kindness they still had in Chile, as stated.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but the conversation will be even more difficult after that.
These two countries have not been convoluted with the delegates since 1982.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, has rejected the court’s decision to make an uninterested decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to reveal on a new page to deal with Chile" and the opportunity to "resolve the Thirty Years of Conflicting," say.
Calzadilla has also rejected the fact that Morales - ism is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — using the sea as a political device.
" Bolivia will never give up her right to reach the Pacific Ocean," she says.
"This judgment is a time to see that we have to overcome past events."
North Korea says that it will not give up nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s President Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons first if he does not trust Washington.
Ri referred to Saturday at the United Nations Assembly.
He has asked the United States to follow through on promises held during the conference in Singapore among charismatic leaders.
He makes this statement just when U.S. President Mike Pompeii is about to strike again more than three months after Singapore and Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says that it's a "multi-day" that the continued isolation and refusal of the United States is a declaration that ends the Korean War will even cause North to surrender.
Washington has been cautious to agree before Pyongang’s first step in breaking the weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second meeting.
But many people are skeptical that Pyonging is willing to give up weapons that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang this next month to prepare for the Kim and Trump meeting.
Paris fashion exhibitions show the latest scenes you will see on the streets of a nearby city
If you want to increase your hats or if you want to close the sun, then go somewhere else.
The inventors Valentino and Thom Browne have begun to create a vast array of strangely larger spectacles of the SS19 which have been set aside on the deck in the section of Paris's Fashion Week.
These dramatic hats have spread to Instagram this type, and the designers have sent their frightening hats to the view.
Valentino’s solitary helmet has a broad blade that covers the whole head of the wearer.
Other extremely large hats included umbrellas with razors, glove hats, and even pines, but they are not intended to warm your head.
Thomas Browne also came with a series of horrendous masks that were about the same time as Christmas.
Many of these colorful marmots have their beaks decorated and similar to Hannibal Lecter’s fashions.
One helmet would seem to have entered the water with a respiratory liquid while the other was like an ice cream.
And if you are attracted to fads in fashion, you are blessed.
People who look at the hats say that the beads may be coming to your neighborhood too.
These main hats are on the feet of La Bombay, a two-foot sun hat worn by people like Rianna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The bunker that made these strange hats filled with man - made lines has brought a larger display of a straw bag carried along the coast almost as large as the manned by the life jacket you carry.
The raffia, with the upper edge of the fluke, was the front of Jacques's code La Rivira SS19 in the Paris section.
The famous designer Luke Artimage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the large hats and jeopards reach people in the following summer - as their designers have put them down to the last summer' will be hard to ignore the people who will seek these great things. '
John Edward: Language skills vital for people of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a reputation for academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 and other results that have not yet passed, which are strengthened by individual and group success in sports, art, music, and other human endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide a high level of service to both students and parents.
Independent schools seek to equip their students for higher education, a standard of education, and the environment in which they live.
As a part of education that can create and put an adequate school material, we see existing languages continue as a favorite subject and a requirement for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘ If you talk to someone in a language that you can understand, you reach his mind.
If he speaks to him in his own language, he achieves his own harm.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on the English to build friendships and confidence with foreign settlers.
From the recent results of studies, we can see that languages are higher in the library than in the average number of independent schools.
A 6 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have received articles in Highergrade A.
A data collected, at 74 schools of SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students have received Highgrade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the French students and 63 percent of the Spanish students have received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as valuable skills for children and young people who are certainly looking for them in the future.
Now languages, such as the choice of education, are similarly valued as subjects of SSTEM (science, technology, meiring and metematics) for private schools and other institutions.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons employed by employers to have problems with filling positions in the workplace, 17 percent are associated with a lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly needed in preparing young people for future assignments.
As more and more job opportunities require more languages, these suggestions are vital to a harmonious world.
No matter what employment you choose, learning another language, you will have more opportunities in the future to acquire this same skill.
Being able to communicate with people of other nations, there are many opportunities for a greater number of languages.
According to your Gov test done by more than 4,000 older UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to communicate and only in French is spoken by more than 15 percent.
That is why spending money on an increase in the language is now important to today’s children.
A knowledge of many languages, especially of those in developing lands, will equip children for a lucrative career.
In Scotland each school will have its own language.
A number of schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages thought to be important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages in which you can choose from private schools, there will also be good teachers in this section.
The independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide a system of education that will equip children with the skills needed to become successful, no matter where they go in the future.
There is no denying now, in the world’s business situation, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "the ability to communicate with the world."
The private schools will continue to offer this choice, separation and laying their hands on the young people in Scotland.

LeBron will break the Lakers record on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is only for followers who want to see LeBron James for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' instructor Luke Walton announced that James would play the Sunday's ordeal against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it will seem that she will be playing for a few minutes.
"You will be more than 48," said Milton in the official Lakers website.
An essay by Lakeers Mike Trudel noted that in taking a nap, James may have played only a few minutes.
After some training early this week, James is asked about his plans for the quiet harbor of Lakers.
"I don't want the predominance games in this level of my work to be good," said I.
Trump's West Virginia Randly Time, in You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his wrestling - out party a evening at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of its five scheduled conventions this coming week, including visiting friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate’s vote is established until he is selected to place him in the Supreme Court, Trump tries to cast aside the support of the second election since the Republicans are in danger of losing the Congression when it is voted in Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia be held the evening and how can you view it on the Internet?
The Trump convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch West Virginia’s Trump convention online at a mobile device in You Tube.
Trump is expected to speak at the meeting of the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanauugh, in a difficult situation because of charges of sexual misconduct that are suspected that a proof vote will be set up for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to cope with November’s election.
As a result, the President Trump's project stated that the five meetings in the coming week are aimed at "the support of volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and increase the figures they have in the legislature and the House of Representatives," reports the Reuters.
"Controling the Congress is so important to him that the president is going to so many countries as we approach a busy voter," the speaker of the Tump, who did not want to be known to tell him what the Reuterss said.
Listed in Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, this today's fairy tale can cast off support from "Ohio and Pinsylvania and is also known as Pittsburgh by their news," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which the state section conquered by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help the So - and - so Musser of the West Virginia Republic by Patrick Morrisey, who walks behind the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morsisey that the president is obliged to come and give him support," says Simon Header, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ruder Cup 2018: The American team shows that if you hunger for success, you will continue to fight as a person who is out looking for individual sports on Sunday.
After three games alone, playing as the base of the four was the main need for this Ruder Cup.
The rank of top in any team has given the notion of sports in which the athletes really believe, and in such competitions as this.
In that sense, then, who is the most important person right now?
"They paid six articles and are now four, so I think we're going ahead," says Jordan Spieth while walking that day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, 4 points above and 12 others have not yet been confirmed.
The Melikanas, as Steve says, feel that they are normal and that there are many who can be drawn to them, including how Scott and Justin played well throughout the day and the couple have three out of four articles.
Scott has always played well since the beginning and paid for example.
When a loud shout gave way to laughter, he placed the ball at a time important to win the game after he and Thomas had been hit by two blows.
Whiskers in a hole that gives them a winning game by the age of 15 make people in a similar way, in a way that tells you that the American team cannot be defeated.
"You must be concerned about your entire game," says Scott.
So they quit.
18 holes to mark it.
The characters on the top of both Scott and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, an unconstitutional story of dyder Cup
The European way of life creates unusual couples and cannot do anything wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the one who didn't top the bogey on Saturday afternoon and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Back Nineveh on Friday morning.
That cooperation, along with their interest, is seen in the crowds as church athletes to win, and no other popular player can conquer Europe at the sunset of Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood and Monnari.
It is better for both of them to play at the same time at different places.
Reporting on the success of Europe has not yet been seen, however.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson did the job of Sergio Garcia, a champion of four footballs in the morning, when he obtained cooperation with Alex Noren.
The Bogey and the two other two-surft articles and the Spanish hole and Mswanda had not been able to get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is someone who can help you to get out of the hole.
Four footballs and four players enjoy watching them close - up because of a combination of people, their advice, their advice, their advice, and how the schedule can change in a matter of time.
Europe has proved to be a better team until now and is leading to the last day, but four players have shown that the American team is hungry for an unconventional achievement if possible, especially Stateside.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the dyder Cup.
Europe will lead well on the last day of the Ruder Cup after the four articles and four games that have made it possible to pay for the U.S.
It is interesting for a couple named Tommy Fletwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game to win the struggling Tiger Woods to make progress in the Golf National by four points.
The case of Thomas Bjorn of Europe, seeking to conquer the doll that defeated Hazel in the last two years, won the American case in four articles, conquering a series of 31 games.
The United States did not accept the four games, win two games, although they were unable to end the debt.
Jim Furryk’s side requires 8 articles in 12 individual games to get this award
Fleetwood is the first European to reach four new points at the same time as Moninari, called "Milliwood" after the first week of the first couple to win four notes in opening the Ruder Cup.
Beatings Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls went on to conquer Woodsn and the Melanesian school in 5 and 4.
Woods, attracted to two Saturday games, showed interest there and divided 19 of the 29 games in soccer with four players and four players as well as as as as as as as several as a range in a row
Justin Rose is resting in the morning of these four bearsbuls and her partner Henrik Stenson in the Fours and 1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world leaders.
Europe was in great turmoil in France.
Three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas did a very good thing to the Melanesian in receiving two articles on Saturday.
Having won 2 times less than 1 when playing Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of the fo'sbaals again separated Paul and Rory McIlroy by 4 and 3 of the quarters between two openings.
Just twice in the dyder Cup team return from the division by four articles to individual sports, although Furryk’s side requires playing in the other person’s hands for each piece
After the second day, the attack on Sunday secures them.
North Korea says that it ‘ would never complete its weapons before it could find safety.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the charges made the U.S. confidence and that there was no way for America to complete its Nuclear weapons when they could obtain security assurance.
Ri Yong Ho told the audience to take positive steps last year, such as stopping equipment testing and unloading the Nuclear Arms, and making a promise that we should not make nuclear weapons again.
"Even so, we don't see similar measures from America," said the U.S.
"If there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country and in this case we will not give up our weapons without speaking to the United States."
While Ri goes back to what was commonly said by North Korea about the American objection to complete Nuclear weapons in subsections that North Korea was rewarded for the small measures he took, his report did not deny the fact that Pyonging of the offensive weapons.
Ri told of a joint report published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first conference between the president of the United States and the governor of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work ‘ complete Nuclear' instead of Korea' while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to put an end to the war of Korea in 1950-53, but the American said that Pyonang must first get rid of nuclear weapons.
Wahington’s appeal to reduce the severe international sentences facing North Korea was rare.
"Americans demand "runner completion of Nuclear's weapons first" and increases the level of pressure by means of sentences to fulfill their purpose in a strict way, against the declarations of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The idea that judgments can frighten us is a false dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that these sentences increase distrust.
Ri has not mentioned plans for one of the Kim and Trump conferences, which the American leader spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead, the officer spoke of three meetings between Kim and the governor of southern Korea and Mone-in five months ago and added: "If the group in this case of passing nuclear weapons is in the southern part of Korea and not in America, is it not possible to complete Nuclear's weapons instead of Korea."
Even so, Ri's speech sounds more different than the previous year, when speaking to the general U.N. convention, which said that the target of North Korea's missiles in the American country was inevitable after "Mn. Wicked President" Trump called Kim "man of flying weapons."
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to ‘ completely destroy ’ North Korea, boldly gave Kim praise for taking action to disarme weapons, but that is much more important than the high - priority job and the farthest penalties for North Korea to complete the Nuclear Arms.
On Wednesday, Trump spoke that he had no set time, saying, "If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongang for the measures she took.
Even so, American secretary - general Mike Pompeii told the U.N. National Security Council on Thursday: "Don't let the sanctions of the Security Council go on fast until we see the complete and sure totality of Nuclear weapons.."
The Security Council has expanded sentences in North Korea since 2006 for the expense of Pyonang's flying Nuclear Systems.
Pompey met Ri beyond the General Assembly of the U.N and said that he would visit Pyondang again to prepare for a second conference.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his final visit has failed.
He left Pyondang in July saying that there has been some progress made, but North Korea is independent of saying that he has made ‘ the same needs as the loggers do.'
North Korea promised to meet More in this month so that they could break up the space of the flying Nuclear Arms if America was "cointual measures."
Kim told her that the ‘ relevant measures ’ that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress of normal relations with Washington
Harvard students take enough rest courses
A new study at Harvard University this year made all students who are not yet pregnant to sleep enough to fight nightly learning with caffeine.
One expert has found that students at this high university do not know anything about the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep therapist at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, held the study, believing that this type was the first one in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the consequences of not having enough sleep during the study.
‘ When the class is finished with one of her classes, one girl came to stand and said: ‘ Why am I told that now, I’m going to finish school? ’
He said to me that no one had told him the importance of that sleep which amazed me, ’ he told The Telegraph.
This study was started this year, explaining the benefits of sleep about educational and sports development, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of medical services at a university, says that the university has decided to bring this lesson to the attention after finding students who do not really get enough sleep.
This one - hour study includes enjoyable activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom, where students are cutting into coffee cups, curtains, training clothing and books for the purpose of explaining the effects of caffeine and light and how much sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants were told how insufficient sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its fascinating features, encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
‘ We know that he will never change the behavior of the disciples immediately.
Even so, we believe they have the right to know you as you also have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking lung smoking, ’ says teacher Czeisler.
The culture of chronic insomnia is still present, he adds, adding that modern technology and stress in students are a growing problem.
To ensure a good night’s sleep is to be an invisible weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, as well as avoid obesity, as insomnia weakens the mind, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student in California who studied chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to study the class, after he attended his first class at Harvard.
She said that the class had opened her eyes and that it had captured her interest to make the whole school available.
It is hoped that the next step is to invite the students to make a similar study program before entering the contest.
Dr. Czeisler has suggested that students think that they have a wake - up alarm, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of electrical light bulbs and LED light, which can interfere with your daily routine, which can lead to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Ringers Menga won Gerard’s men in one article
The Ringers also faced a problem when they played while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerard with a single point on a pin (1-0) at Livingstone.
The Brox's side was interested in crossing first after the St Johnstone struck 41 in February. But the group of Gary Holt hit Gerard for the second time in the 18th games, which began to be the manager as he was stripped of eight points except the leading leading stream of the Ladbrokes Premiershipsships, the Heats.
Menga received an article in a few minutes before the haf-time and the Ringers were not interested either.
While the Ringers fell to the sixth, Livingstone rose to the third after which Hibernian left him in one article.
There were problems still to come to the Ringers after Alineman had been treated with head injuries after he had been hit by a fluke from the side of the players.
Gerard has changed the times of the duration of the Ayr's move on the before the final battle of the Betred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt has continued the same 11 Livingstone players who took the same point from Hearts the previous week and has rejoiced at how his team hit its opponents in every way.
The Ringers have controlled the game but Livingstone has done more when it gets the ball.
It should have hit an article in the second minutes when Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass on to the Allan McGregor's limbs but the player has not found it.
Kesulun Jacobs rejected soccer at the hands of Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to open up in the back of the stairs.
The Ringers had no control but seemed more optimistic than the third game before the last.
Aredo Morelos felt he should get a pent in a half hour mark as he and Steve Lawles clashed but the poet Steve Thomson ignored the cry of the Colombian athlete.
The Ringers had the opportunity to kick the ball near the pole before the first stage was completed, but the Ibrox player Liam Kelly had no problem with the ball mounted on the head of Lassana Coubal and on Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that has been difficult to obtain, there is someone who can deny that it is truly worth it without just hard work.
Also, Ringers failed to prevent the ball from being shot by Jacobbs.
Scott Arfield did not act like Declan Gallagher who handed a ball to Scott Robinson, who did not worry about winning Menga.
Gerard made the first change as he changed Coubaly introduced Ryan Kent to the change and produced results immediately as the player opened the belleralis but the great player ran away from the block.
But Livingstone has continued to make this travel group to play what he wants, and Lithgow and Halket were also playing ball away.
The Holt team could get an article at the beginning of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow put it on the poles.
Another then introduced Ringers player, Glenn Middleton, has another case of punishment as he meets Jacobbs but has not taken the lead in Thompson too.
Almanac: Geiger Counter producer
And now page from "Sonday Morning" Almamac: September 30, 18882, the last 136 years ago, and SSSABA ... the date that scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The Geiger developed the search method and the measurement of radiation, which was produced by this development of a device known as the Geiger Counseler.
It has been used since then, the Geiger Counterer has also been used in the culture of pop culture, as shown in a 1950 movie known as "Bells of Colondao," with the impossible - to - bes for scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:

Rogers: "It's the Geiger Conuter, used to search for precious gems.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the effects of Atoms which are produced by radiation.
Evans: "Tell, right now!"

Kane West closed Trump's Support in Words, With a TRAMA hat, after appearing on the SNL.
It Did Not Go Well
Kane West had not received the fine support during the Saturday Light Live after a short stroke bringing praise to the American President Donald Trump and said he would join the election in 2020.
After he sang the third song that night, the Ghost Town, which he sang with a box on which Makke America Great wrote, he spoke against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"Many times when I speak to a white person when they say: "How would you love Trump? you’re a racial man."
And if I were concerned about race, I would have been gone a long time ago, he said.
SNL started its program with a video showing Matt Damon laughing on the evidence of Brett Kavanauugh before the Court of Justice on sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not in circulation, the West video is placed in a chat room by the comicist Chris Rock.
It is not apparent that Rock was trying to smile at West.
Also, the West is angry with the spectators because he has had difficulty in going in about his proposal.
"They have used me here in the back.
They said to stand, ‘ Don't go in there with this pillow which you carry.'
They abused me!
And they said I was in the wet," says the Washington Examiner.
The West added by saying: "Do you want to see a wet spot?" which means you will put on "Superman's suit, because it means what I want. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to show love.
His talks received no support from the SNL viewers and staff to be ashamed, says the Variety, and another man saying: "All the slide is silent."
West was introduced to Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend died, rap singer Mac Miller a few days ago.
West has puzzled many by singing the song I Love It, which is the same as Perrier Bottle.
West receives support from the head of TPUSA, Canadian Turner, who wrote to Towitter: "I talk to a very courageous person: I AM MINUTED TO THE PRINCIPAL.."
And system administrator Karen Hunter wrote to Towtter that the West just said he was ‘ very real and wonderful.
"But I have decided not to pay anyone (by buying his music or giving him support with his "ability") which I believe he accepts and expresses harmful ideas from my society.
You are free.
So, too, you're saying.
Prior to the program, the rap singer informed Twitter to his followers to change his name in justice, saying that he is known as "The One and the West's right now."
He is not the first singer who has changed his name and follows the steps of Diddy, known as Pruff Adddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rap partner, Snop Dogg, has changed his name to Snop Lion and the lost singer of the ancient history known by the Prince who changed his name to a character.

HIV/ Aids: China reports a 14 - percent increase in new patients
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country who are affected, reports the medical staff.
An estimated 40,000 sufferers were affected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
In many cases people are affected sexually by the disease, which is different from what has been common in the past.
Naturally, many Chinese people are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of people affected in this way was virtually gone, and the medical authorities in China said at a regional convention in Yunnan.
Each year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually affected with HIV is a real problem for China’s BBT population.
Homosexuality is no longer a dominant factor in China since 1997, but discrimination against the people of the GBT is said to be difficult.
Because this country has such negative views, research has made it clear that men who have sexual relations with 70-90% of men will marry with surrounding partners.
Several times the effects are created not sufficiently safe in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to treat HIV infection as a part of the problem.
Maxine Waters challenged the details regarding the officially issued by a staff of GoP, a ‘ hard lie ’ and ‘ to say things that are not available'
American representative Maxine Waters on Saturday refutes the claims that one of his employees had personal information of the Republican Pioneers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles meant that the charges were spread by experts and Web sites that took their side.
"The lie, lying and a lot of lies," says Waters in a Twies report.
According to the data released home addresses and telephone numbers of these American connected. Lindsey Graham of the South Carolina, and Mike Lee included Orrin Hatch, Utah.
These details came from the Internet on Thursday, introduced by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the talk on the lack of restraint and the charges of the improbability of the Supreme Court General Brett Kavanaugh.
These details were released some time after the Net invited Kavanaugh to questions.
Wise Web sites such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedState reported that the IP addresses indicate that the source of input comes from Waters Office" and even published details of Waters' worker, reports The Hill.
"These unfounded charges are completely false," added Waters.
"A member of the staff - put at risk because personal information has been published because of these missing false charges - he has not been responsible for the removal of these supplies.
This groundless charge is absolutely false.
Waters report received immediate criticism from the Internet, including the former secretary of the American President Ari Fleischer.
"This denial instead of sound," writes Fleischer
"It shows that he does not have the degree of being a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to feel angry.
He does not have to fight.
There is no need to inquire about the accuser’s motives.
It must be quiet and cool."
Fleischer might have compared Waters ’ response to the criticism of Democrats by Judge Kavanauugh, accused of being very angry at the fourth pressure.
Omar Navarro, the Republican twine who have no choice to release Waters during the year, has also expressed his opinion on Titus.
"The main stories when this is true," writes to the acknowledged Tewtter.
In his alarm, Waters said that his office had announced ‘ the proper authorities and the legal institutions with false charges.
We will make sure that suspects are exposed," he added, "and they will legally pay for their risky actions to my employees."
Translation of Johnny English Strikes Akain - defeat of Rowan Atkins
It is not uncommon for days to look at things like Brexit when watching English - related film and in this old comic and jeopardic movie, Johnny English - released in 2003 and returned in 2011 called Johnny English Born.
Will this exciting movie talk talk about the possibility that we can no longer sell foreign products?
A layman named Johnny English has received his license to renew his reputation of being a luxury made by non - English onlookers.
It is indeed the work of the State’s most active and uniquely so - called State, with little Clousau, and Mr. Bean and at least one male singing a single musical article in the Chariots of Fire in the London Oriphys in 2012.
He even became a traveler and the world's known secretman Atkinson who used to imitate the Barclaycards, leaving the conflicts where he went.
There are only one or two beats in this film, the JE.
I loved the time that Johnny English came to the helicopter in his front protective costumes while the helicopters hit his whistle.
Atkinson's gift of innocent humor is interesting, but it is not strong when compared with such difficult products as 007 and the Mission Impinsil.
These jokes, as if children were considered by adults, do not appear to be on my side when Johnny’s jeopardizing English is a little more effective than Atkinson’s silent film when he played Bean
News on this movie that the English are in serious trouble
The Internet operator has unwittingly entered the Internet network, seeing details of all English objects working, until it is the surprise of a job reveal - the small role of Kevin Eldon.
The news simply passes through a proud top official, dealing with the problem of not being popular as a politician: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as she plays Teresa May, but the film’s author has not done so well when she writes it
The wise counselors told him that just like all the attempts are in danger, there is an urgent need to bring back a retired person.
And that is how the fool Johnny English himself, who has received the position of the principal of the school, is a free, but does provide lessons about the unidentified identity of the athlete, while English is teaching in an unusual way to be a bully than ever.
English is returned to Whitehal and told of this emergency to meet his former fellow sufferer Bough, who was also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, married to the submarine captain
This talented couple returned to their place of employment, and they met Ophelia Bulletova, who had been eaten by Olga Kurylenko
Meanwhile, a high official believes in a multibillion - dollar technological figure that it can solve the problems of English computers: evil man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
English and Bough began that hibernation: pretending to be no donors, burning a French food chain; they started problems when they boarded a small Volta luxury ship; and England brings the attack while using an ensign on the heads of the Virtual Real Reality in order to read the inside of the Volta.
Everything has been done in the final sections, though interesting and enjoyable, rather than television programs for children to talk about all of this.
Normalities.
Like all other movies by Johnny English: Do I wonder if the English movie industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a suitable role in his ability?
The employment team deny that it is arranging for the British to work for four days but to be paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s team arranged for employees to work four days a week — but for five days ’ wages.
Reports say that the team requires employers to be paid for a day's salary if the companies work with the Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The change would allow employees to have a three - day weekend but still pay the same wage.
The sources say that the program will be “well suited ” with the economic interests of the group and the national shift plan to take the part of the staff
A four - day change in the four - day week marks the support of the Trades Union Congress as a means for employees to take time to change the economy.
The top source of the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: ‘ A study of programs is expected to be reported before the year goes by.
‘ It will never happen immediately, but the four-day working week is the appropriate idea of this group's economic budget to be on the side of the employees and the business schedule of the team.'
The employment team is not the first to give support to such an idea, and the Green Party made a four - day program while giving the election support for 2017.
The program presently does not receive full support from the Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Work Group said: ‘ A four-day working week is not a group system and is not something to consider.'
Assistant director John McDonnell has used a previous job conference to explain his theory of economic reform.
Sir McDonnell says that he is determined to take the power of “the authorities who don't want to be seen by ” and“ those who earn interest in the big business.
The service director's schedule means that the operators in the plant are not getting their share as a government of the work can pay ‘ for a fee ’ that they do not do well.
He reaffirmed his policy of reputing employees in business positions and made a pocket of property that includes everyone in order to give employees a 10 - percent share of nongovernmental services that could provide them with £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI could change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the charges laid against the judge Brett Kavanauugh delayed the final vote by his being taken to the High Court a week, and it raises the question whether the results of the research of the institution can change the majority of the Republicans to change their minds with the support they provide.
In a Sunday interview, journalist Scott Pelley asked the Czechist John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them faint.
Kennedy could feel more comfortable talking than his neighbor from South Carolina.
"Yes," says Kennedy.
"I'm going to go into the mound, and I have spoken to the judge Kavanaugh."
I called him after this happened, after the charges were issued, and I said, ‘ Did you do it? ’
And he was quiet, confident, and not afraid.
Nevertheless, it seems that Graham’s jaw was not changed.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's necessary to have a heavy load," says.
Gqhirh. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett has strongly denied these sounds," adds Graham, speaking with Chris Blasey Ford.
And everyone who speaks of him can confirm these charges.
36 years
I can't see the change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has he done something to reduce suffering?
This Saturday, the New York City welcomes the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a chorus and a good purpose; to end poverty.
The issue is now too old, and it receives tens of thousands of people in the Central; Park for entertainment, not for the sole purpose of entertainment, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but for the purpose of the event which is to end severe poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a world - wide center hoping to end poverty by adding people responsible to it.
To get a free ticket for a party (unless you are willing to pay for a ViP ticket), you must do volunteer work such as writing e-mail, calling, or whatever practical ways to inform others of their purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen at 12 years of age been in accomplishing its purpose?
Is it a good thing to give people a fair exchange of support and they feel they make a difference by signing a Internet connection or putting a message on a Thai hand?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reported that 19 million acts have been committed to its supporters, with varying objectives.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage the world’s tax collectors to make reports of commitments and financial policies that will be responsible for the lives of over 2.2 billion people by 2030.
As early as 2018, the team described the resolutions and the 3990 reports on their actions, costing about $10 billion.
Their income has contributed to nearly 649 million people throughout the world.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a co-operation center of the U.K, with the aim of "helping children to grow up to the extent to which they are expected to reach, ” which promises to give Rwanda $335 million to help complete malnutrition in the country after receiving 4,700 messages from the Global Citizen.
"With the backing of the UK government, the governments of various countries and the Global Citizens like you, we can be able to correct malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to tell the public during a case in London in April 2018
After some 5,000 actions in asking the U.K to improve the proper nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financial impact on the problem, through The Power of Nutrition, which helped five million mothers and children to provide food.
In answering one of the most commonly asked questions on the Internet, "What makes you think we can solve a serious problem?"
The Global Citizen said: "There will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as a translation of human rights and a struggle for democracy before us, we will succeed, for we are strong when we are with others.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and others who will be present for the New York event this year, by Debarra-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use submarines to interfere with Russia’s production of electronics by the Secretary of State
America can find safety under the navy in order to prevent Russia from selling power products, including in the Middle East, explains U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan All as the Washington Examiner.
All raised charges of the responsibility of Russia in Syria - where government officials justly made plans to investigate new power systems.
"I believe their aim to be in the Middle East is to sell other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in the belly of South Europe," he says.
And, according to officials, there are ways and abilities to deal with.
"Americans have the power, with the navy, to ensure that seaways are open, and, if necessary, prevent them, to ensure that their electric power does not go to the market, he says.
All were speaking to the audience on the occasion adopted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself ‘ the voice of power users ’ in America.
He then compared the paths that the American had faced with Russia and Iran, thus stating that they have not changed.
"European and Russia's economic choices are almost as much, to increase the costs and acquire additional replacements for oil," that is, when calling Russia for a pot that is able to do one thing that depends on the power of natural resources.
The report comes after Trump’s government put forth efforts to promote export water into Europe, leading to the Russian office, with no higher prices for the people of Europe.
As a result, the Trump government officials, including the American president Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the "not justly" work of the Nord Stream 2, says Trump that this work has made Germany a ‘ prisoner" of Russia.
Russia has also said that this North Stream 2 billion - dollar pipe will double its present population to be 110 billion cubic metres, a good job beyond the economy.
Russia says that American opposition to the work has economic grounds and is an example of poor competition.
"I believe that forces should not be the power of pressure, and consumers are forced to be able to select merchants," says Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after the meeting by American Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow with Sep hope.
The American situation is not well - received in Germany as a result of its commitment to the work.
The leading center of this industry, the State Office of the German Business (BDI), has requested that the United States move away from EU power systems and accords with Germany and Russia.
"I have a serious problem when the third world affects our strength," says Dieter Kempf, head of the German National Trade Center (BDI) after a meeting with German President Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At the city hall at Hokukwu, Warren, from Massachusetts, was sure to enter the election.
"It is now time for the people in the neighborhood to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes having a stable person in a high position," says The Hill.

Warren spoke abusively of the president Donald Trump at the city hall, saying that his father’s ‘ land ’ is in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned so that Donald Trump will do it for our freedom," he says.
Warren is known for his criticism of Trump and his prisoner of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanauugh.
Writing to Lett on Friday, Warren said "Yes, we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
Nevertheless, the votes issued on Thursday reveal that many of Warren’s followers felt that it was wrong to enter the election by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the people's "thought" that the Massachusetts voters did not qualify to enter the election, according to votes from the Superolk Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll.
Thirty - two supported the idea.
These votes that have shown much support to the ancient poet Deval Patrick, 38 percent supported the election.
Some of the remaining names of the Democrats mentioned about the 20th election include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont General Bernie Sanders.
Bill said that he would make a fair decision in January, says the Associated Press.

18 American and D.C.R. sections provide support in rejecting a new policy for security
The eighteen state divisions and the Columbia area provided support for the violation of a new law against the victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 sectors of state and region have signed support for one of the victims who need protection against the law, says NBC.
The full name of the defendants in this situation is between Grace and Actions of the American Civil Liberies Union made in August about the country's undissolved law.
He said that his “guests as well as the sons of his violent friends ” had abused him but the American authorities denied his request for protection on July 20.
Prison Term in Texas
The representatives of the government’s respective sectors give Grace the support of El Savador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are the main sources of security in America, such as in the face of problems with gangs and domestic violence.
This new law about the need for security in America limits the 2014 issue of a refugee board allowing refugees to escape domestic violence to find safety.
Columbia’s International Representative Karl Racine reported on Friday that the new law ‘ rejects old, national, national, and international legislation."
"National legislation requires all appeals to be taken into consideration by the facts and circumstances of the application, and this law will end that," says the courtwards."
The delegates also said that this law prohibiting refugees from entering the United States is a economic advantage, that they may be present for business services and perform necessary duties.
Prosecutor Jeff Sessions issued a ruling to the judges that refugees can be protected if they run away from domestic violence or gang violence is removed in June.
" Security will also be achieved by anyone who has left home because of persecution or because he is concerned about race, religion, or political opinion," said Sesions on June 11 when reporting the law.
Security has never been made to deal with all the problems -- I say that it's the daily experience of people around the world.

An American ambassador blames China for ‘ abuse ’ using ‘ false advertisements ’
A week later the official Chinese newspaper made a four - page advertisement in the American daily for American and Chinese trade profits, a representative of the United States in China accused the country of using the American press to spread lies.
American President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of a China Daily advertisement in Desmoines Register - the best - selling newspaper of Iowa - stop racking China for its purposes to interfere with November 6, which is the case against which China is denying.
The Trump's charge that China is trying to interfere with election is what the American officers tell Reuters that a new section of the American project is going on to put pressure on China.
Even though it is not uncommon for governments in different countries to introduce ads to promote trade, China and America are currently at war in the trade and supply additional prices.
China adds prices to the trade problem at an early stage and is designed to affect foreign import merchants in the governments such as the Iowa who support the Trump of the Republic, say experts from China and America.
Terry Brustad, the representative of the American in China and the former governor of Iowa, is selling to China a large portion of cultivated food, saying that China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Branchad wrote in Des Moines Register, "he is now determined to exploit us by placing false ads in our free journals."
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government risks hearing America using its common free speech culture and having free news and a commercial center in Des Moines Register," writes Brustad.
"Unlike, instead of the news here in Beijing when you go down the window, you will find small differences and see how the Chinese think literally about the economic development in China, we think that the media are under the Chinese Communist class," writes.
He added that "one of the common newspapers has denied her request to publish the article" even if she didn't say which newspaper it was.
Republicans chased the quake before the election of the plain by Kavanaugh, warning observers
Like the high - ranking Republicans standing next to the prisoner of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanauugh and protecting him from his charges, sexual abuse, critics say that they will see bad shots, especially among the chaotic people, in this coming vote of the first half.
Feelings about this situation have passed away, and the republics are still saying again that they want to continue the election.
You can't put these things back," says Grant Reeher, professor of psychology at Syracuse University's Maxwell School telling The Hill when an article was published on Saturday.
Reeher has doubts that the last time efforts of Jeff Flake (R-Arizone) to begin the FBI research can change the opinion of angry voters.
‘ The crooked people will not immediately forget what happened tomorrow - will not be tomorrow or November, ’ says Karine Jean-Pierre, top adviser and a national spokesman for the growing Moveon group on Friday, according to Washington, a D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters would again say, ‘ You’re coming November! ’ walking in the crowded corridor as the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee and decided to continue the capture of Kavanaugh in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"His interest in freedom and encouragement is great," says Stu Rothenberg, an impartial critic, telling the media.
"People have begun to say that you are up, this is true.
But there may be much more, especially to the rowdy people who have not yet decided to vote with the new voters, 18-29, who, although not interested in the president but who are not usually voters.
Even before Ford's public testimony explaining the charges against the abduction of the High Court on sexual abuse, critics say that there may be adverse consequences when the Republicans need assurance.
"This has turned out to be a problem about GoP," says Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee last week when it started, according to NBC News.
"It isn't important for the final committee or for Kavanauugh to enter the scene, about how the Republicans deal with the situation and whether they treat her," points out Guy Cecil of the media, the president of the group of Prrioties USA, a group that assists in choosing Democrats.
Even so, the Americans seem to have no understanding of who is to believe the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are few who take the latter side.
A 41 percent of those who participated in one survey indicated that they likely believe or believe the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent showed that they believe it entirely or fully believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent thought that Kavanaugh is possible or is convinced that he is lying while witnessing, while at the same time only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s interest, the FBI does research on the charges against Ford and another demonist, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford presented an oath before a justice committee last week to say that Kavanaugh had abused her for 18 years at Kavanuagh’s alcohol abuse
Ramirez contends that the hostage of the High Court revealed her private parts to her while she attended a ceremony during her schooling at Yale in the 1980s.
The Internet manufacturer designed a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet operator, is embarking on a new project designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technological know - how includes the new Inrupt, a business that produces Solid, a system available to everyone.
Solid allows its users to choose where their information is stored and who can see it.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners- Lee has discussed the purpose of the Inruptuity "world control."
"We must do it now," speaking about this business.
"A minute that will not be forgotten"
This system will allow people to create a ‘ storage facility ’ or POD.
It may include a list of telephone numbers, a list of demands, a calendar, your music and other personal items and services.
It is like that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are in the same place at the same time.
Different from this storage area whether the user chooses what one can see.
The company calls it "by personal armaments of knowledge."
The Inrupt Plan, according to Chief Business Officer John Bruce, to bring the equipment, procedures, and skills in order to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berns- Lee, Bruce, the system purchased by IBM, the social workers who promote the program and the community of volunteer manufacturers.
Since this week, the development of technology worldwide can develop a single system using the technology found on the Internet.
Berners- Lee said that she and her group don't speak of "Faopok and Goodle's" as to whether they have made a major change that would cause their business to be broken down immediately.
"We will not ask for their permission."
"Uerers- Lee said that in writing to the Media on Saturday, the aim of Inruptinence was "to provide interests and places which would help maintain integrity and the new Internet level of the Solid.."
In 1994, Berners- Lee changed the Internet while making the World Wide Web Consertium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the months that follow, Berners- Lee has become an influential voice in this conversation on the Internet.
When opened successfully with Inrupt, Berners-Lee is yet a minister and director of World Wide Web Constitutium, the Internet Center and the Open Data Center.
"Happy via this new network," added Berners- Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria cross minister at WW1
The first and last weeks to obtain Victoria Cross during World War II.
Lt. Col. Cardinal Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 March 1918 when the attack in Vallingse and Lehaucourt was launched.

Later he ran to those who were shooting and with a lot of courage took the big guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German cat’s arm that fired away in October 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions are ‘ something he knows he will never be able to do, but he said it was humbling.'
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a long - distance history after the formation of the Brentwood Imperial Bank.
Michael Vann says that he feels ‘ glorious as he has been affected by a visit" adds that "the courage of a true warrior will be shown by many support."
The MMA advocates were not sleeping to see Bellator 206, but they found just Peppa Pig
Think, for example, that you need not sleep because you want to watch Bellator 206 just to meet and play.
The San Jose system has long had 13 battles, including six which were distributed overnight at the Channel 5 in UK.
On 6 o’clock in the morning, at this time Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, the UK observers were amazed at the change in Peppa Pig.
Some are embarrassed as they stay up all night to see the battle.
One successor described the change in animation as a bad joke
"The government's law if since 6 o’clock the system has become inadequate because they have had to change to include what is not seen by children, "This means the President of Advertising and Bellator's communications, when asked about what happened.
"U Pepp the pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker said they would change their times next so that the UK observers could also watch.
When I think about playing it again again, I think it might be possible," says Coker,
"The problem is that the time is six o'clock in the morning around them on Sunday will not be able to do this until Sunday round Monday for them.
But we bring with us a plan
I believe, when it turns over, a lot of sprays came in and all of them were unhappy.
We tried to fix it, but at first we thought that our mechanical problem was the problem.
But otherwise, it has been a State problem.
I promise you that we will never return.
We are going to reduce five wars to five — as a chapter - and try to bring more than they expected but we say we did much.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Darley feels ‘ little ’ because of her sex
Olympic diver Tom Dary says that he grew up younger because of his sexual nature - but gave him a desire to succeed.
This 24- year- old man tells me that I am going to a second school if I'm not like other people.
Speaking of the first section of the Desert Island Discs under Lauren Laverne in Radio 4, he says that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
He said that being a parent had paid him for not considering winning the Olympics any longer.
The program’s well - known director, Kirsten Young, has recovered for months because of illness.
To appear like a loser in Laverne's first role, Daley says that she felt too small when she was growing up because it was ‘ forbidden to have romantic interest in boys and girls.'
He said: "To this day, feelings of smallity and a very different feeling, are the things that have impressed me with the ability to succeed."
She wanted to prove herself ‘ something, ’ saying, so that she would not be disappointed everyone when they found out about her sexual nature.
This winner who won the two Olympic copper medals has campaigned in public with the LGBT and has used his fame this year to the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to make terrorism fair.
He said that he felt fortunate to be able to live without any problems and to give others the "hope."
This third world winner said that he had a relationship with another American movie producer in 2013 - "I didn't expect it."
Dale has married this Oscar conqueror, who is 20 years older than he was last year, but says that the gap between them has not been a problem.
"When faced with such things at a young age" - going to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later and said that it was hard to find someone of the same age facing similar life problems.
This couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says, ‘ All his thoughts have changed.
"If you asked me last year I would tell you that I need to ‘ get a gold ring, ’ he said.
"You know, there are great things to complete the Olympic Goliads.
My Goliath's wheel Robbie's.
Her son had a name similar to that of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Regarding her dad’s death, one of her last comments asked her if she had London tickets for 2012 - long.
"I didn't know that ‘ you won't be in the place of the net'," said he.
"I took her by hand when she was finished breathing and saw after she no longer breathes if she could stay forever," she said.
The following year Stanley competed with the Olympics in 2012 and obtained a copper ring.
"I saw that this was what I had always dreamed of — rowing in front of the crowd at the Olympic Games, I didn't feel any better," he said.
It also impressed him that his first nickname, Proud by Heather Small — which he had always been interested in in the public eye — was still a threat to him.
Diesert Island Discs is discovered at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday: 15 BST.
Mickelson out of play has been put on the stage on the Ruder Cup game on that Saturday.
General Philip Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday while playing his 47rd Cup game, but he has to change his play so as not to make this unhappy record.
Mickelson, who plays at this event twice a year, is put in charge by Captain Jim Furryk on a 4 - soccer game with 4 people.
Instead of being seen by the crowds, as usual when playing the American game, the winner five times spent his short life away from playing and then re training them for the sake of setting up a problem.
Although at the top of the game, the 48 - year - old player is ill - equipped to play in Le Golf National, where the grass is present and makes it difficult for the football players to play.
If the playing field itself is frightening to itself, Mickelson, at the ninth - grade act on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, the best - known British Open football, who has collaborated with Tommy Fleetwood students in order to win all their games in this week.
If Melanes, less than 4 articles, could well start a 12 - to - one sport, Mickelson’s game would be more important.
Furryk has shown implicit trust in my husband.
"She fully understood his role today, hit me a little back and put her arm around me and said she would be ready tomorrow."
"You really trust yourself.
You have found a place for a famous hall and have added much to this group over the past time, and this week.
I never imagined that he would play two games.
I thought it was more likely to play sports than we did, but it was not to go as we thought it would be.
He wants people to know him, as everyone else does.
Mickelson will pass the record of Nick Faldo to play many games on the Ruder Cup in the Church.
He can make his decision to play on the dyder Cup that does not differ from his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 victories, divided into 20 times as well as a dozen pounds, since Furryk said that his presence had brought invisible things to the group.
"He is joking, joking, quick to answer, he likes to ridicule people, and he is a good person in the gang rooms" he explains.
"It's great to see young players laughing about him in this week to see that."
He provides only more happiness.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a high priority can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows that we can easily lose a leading position as a group continues ahead of the Ruder Cup but can change at any time.
This top athlete began playing in a game in Valderrama, where the charge paid by the Sve Ballestros was five points ahead of America but was buried later, winning at 141,131 13.2.
"You will tell yourself that you have many points in Valderrama; you have many in Brookline, where you are buried and Valderrama, where we won, hardly," in the fire of Bjorn, photographed, after viewing the parade of 2018 at 5-3 Friday and the preceding day in 10-6 of Le Golf National
So history will teach me and everyone in this group that you have not yet completed.
We're going to give up everything we have for tomorrow
We will do all we can to do.
This is not yet complete until there are points on the board.
We have a goal, and it is to try to conquer the sex scene that is our goal.
Once again, I refer to 12 players on my side, but we know we're facing any of the other side of the players that have escaped the rest of the world.
Thrilled with how his players played in this hard - playing area, Bjor added: ‘ I never thought of that.
The next day, uncleanness means something different.
The next day the individual’s ability to play is tested, and the opposite is the case.
It’s easy to have a partner here when things are going well, but when you are alone, you start being tested as a boxer.
That is the message that every player has to receive, they must reveal it tomorrow.
Now, you have come with your partner to show them again.
In contrast with Bjorn, another character, Jim Fundyk, looks for his players to play well apart from a team of players, except Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four notes.
Furryk had been on two sides of the changes of the last day, being on the sides of the Brookline when it won and was defeated as Europe performed ‘ a miracle in Medinah.'
"I remember everything he said," answers Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, how did he interest them when they were on their way to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but you should not keep that in mind as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
Once you start winning all the time, it puts stress on the game at a high level.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that will have good results, you know, we want to practice magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to pay back the war and is faced by Roy McIlroy in the upper games, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Pulter Yurpohu.
"I go with this group of men on this schedule because I think it's all over," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
The German battleship has been recutted.
A new German ship should not be set free in 2014 to enter the hold of warships known as the Col War, but the following year will not be released because of the ship's problems and costs, says the reporter.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a paid ship described by Baden-Wutterberg-clas self-driggates, is reduced to the first half of the 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit as a military spokesman.
The ship should not have entered the Royal Navy by 124, but the landing of goods has made it possible.
These four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships in 2007 will replace the Bremens.
It was known that there would be great power equipment, along with fireships and planes and other technology that would make you invisible to Radar, infrared and acoustics.
Also important is that it takes a long time before it has to be corrected and can take two years away from home.
However, continued disturbances cause these new ships, which are said to give Germany power over the other side, and are out of the way when they are released.
This flagship was issued in the news last year, when the German Navy opposed the ship’s ship’s sail safely back to the Brom & Voss in Hamburg
It was the first time the Royal Navy had returned the ship to the market after it was introduced.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship’s restoration, but German journalists say that there are problems with the "ships and goods" that make the ship work well, which has made the ship useless in battle.
The machinery is more efficient as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are used by 120% of the people required to use the old Bremen.
Also, it appears that the ship has a very heavy weight to reduce her ability and that the Royal Navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This "IRheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be a second greater than the ships like which were used by the millenarians during the second world war.
Despite the lack of equipment, the cost of the project — as well as the cost of teaching employees to use it — is beginning to become a problem.
It is estimated to have reached £3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from £2.2 billion
The problems of these new ships are important when it is indicated that German naval power is declining.
Early this year, Hans-Per Bartels, chief of the German parliamental Security Committee, admitted that the Navy is ‘ out of the ship's reach for war.
The officer says that the problem has grown with age, since old ships have been discharged from the army but no new ones.
He then said that none of the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg were able to enter the navy.
The New Trust listens to the news about flying animals like rats
A new flavor produced in the Scottish Highlands seeks to explain that the animals use half of the land’s surface to obtain food.
It is hoped that the results will give us insight into how these animals behave and how they can be protected.
This study by the Scottish scientists of the National Trustees of Scotland will follow these familiar animals, which make soprano, with long ears and Daubentons in Invevewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in important positions in this area to show what they are doing during the year.
The NHS workers and volunteers will take a close look at the residents with hand - held machines.
An acoustics will take a complete look to identify the frequency of the species.
A map of the habitat of the animals as well as a report will be made to give a picture of the behavior of the animals.
Rob Dewar is an adviser to the NTS environment, hoping the results will be to see the approach of these animals that like any type of environment.
These details will help us to see what the benefits are for protecting wildlife habitats and how we can maintain the wildlife habitats.
The existence of animals in Scotland and the UK has been reduced a hundred years ago.
They are at risk because of the construction and development of habitats.
Airborne Turbines and light may pose a threat to these animals as well as to flying papers and chemicals from buildings, as well as to cat attacks.
These animals are not invisible.
Even so, their daily need for food is often greater than their eyes when it comes to catching food.
They get their food in a fit of rage when they return to their ears to detect food or to prevent them from flying.
The NTS, responsible for caring for the more than 270 old areas, 38 important gardens and 66,000 square miles [76,000 sq km] of land, assume that these animals are important.
It has ten trained professionals, which make further drills, surveys of their habitats, and other rescues.
The center has made the only national park in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals.
Local administrator David Thompson says that this place is the proper place for them
"Here in Threave we have a beautiful place for these animals," he says.
"We have old places, old trees, and a good place to live.
There is much you can't know about animals, so the work we do here and other places will help us to explain what they need to survive."
He says that the importance of studying these animals before taking care of the area is important, since if the animal habitat is damaged, 400 children can die in a fold, which can complete the rest of the species.
These animals are safe and illegal to commit suicide, to interfere with the abuse of them and their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, head of Scotland’s Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to help.
He said, "There is still much to know about these animals, and how many of them we do not know."
Ronalo has resisted false charges of fraud and his lawyers will pay a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando has made false accusations of rape, claiming that people want to make a name in his name.
Her attorneys will hire the German press Der Spiegel, the source of the charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus player has been accused of rape by a hardened American victim, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in 2009
It is said that he was costing $37,000 to say nothing about the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of the Insagram that spread to 142 million of his followers just a few hours after these accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, is against them saying that "it's false."
"No, only, but not only, but only.
What they say today, lies all too often," the Ballon d'or winner five times says to the camera.
"They want to make known to men by my name.
It’s normal.
They wanted to be known by my name, but now that is all too common.
I am happy and good," added the player, laughing.
Ronalo's lawyers said that they were prepared to pay the Der Spiegel on these charges that, according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schchertz says that the player wants to give up ‘ spiritual harm due to the abuse of personal rights in the past years."
This event is dated June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the bar, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the player’s room, where they are raped back, according to documents placed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the event he was accused of being a "good man" "99 percent" problem is one percent of the problem.
The authorities say that Ronald had made sure that the couple stayed together, but they had good reason.
Myorga says that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later they agreed to speak out of court because she felt she was afraid of returning and concerned about the shame.
The 34 - year - old says that he now wants them to return to the sword because what he said is still painful for Ronald.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the accusation, and this summer he went to the great Italian group Juventus sold at about £100 million
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret forever ’ the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would be sorry forever if he would not lose his forward position in producing cars after Brexit, says mechanical secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was concerned that Toyota at the UK told BBC that Britain could travel on the EU beyond the negotiator will take a little time to establish their firm in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a connection," says Mr. Clark.
This car manufacturer from Japan said that the tendency to stop the flow of goods on the border when no connection to Brexit can complete the work.
The Bunnaston production – producing the Toyota Airs and the Avensis – produced about 150,000 cars last year that 90 percent was shipped to other countries in the European Union.
"It's my determination that if Britain is going to the EU at the end of March we will see the effects cease from our production," says Marvin Cooke, governor of Toyota in Burkaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have expressed their fear of moving the EU without any connection on how to trade, including the Honda, BMW and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its production of Oxford Day at about a month after Brexit.
A serious concern about this may also pose a threat to commerce when there is no connection to Brexit.
The Toyota production list is conducted by a "procession of time," with auto goods arrive every 37 minutes from the UK and EU vendors for the purpose of producing cars to be purchased immediately.
Also, the UK travels to the EU without a co-operation on 29 March, there may be a barrier where the industry says there may be little delays and clothing.
Not if Toyota had enough clothes to keep up the date of her production in Derbyshire, says the business, and the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's program with the EU's "to prevent this test problem."
"We need a connection. We want a very good combination that will allow us to take up this opportunity," telling BBC 4 BBC radio on a program called Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we were through a fully successful development."
Toyota did not appear about how long the use is delayed, and she has long periods, warning that rising costs will slow down the athletic ability in time and finish the job.
Peter Tsoullaris, who has worked for 24 years and who is in the United States in the article, says that they are about to worry again. "I know that the time I’ve spent this activity will never come back."
A government spokesman says: "Give us a reliable plan about future accordance with the EU
A meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed, says the U.S. president’s office
The special conference of Donald Trump and the general ambassador Rod Rosenstein can be replaced one week as the battle of the upper court Brett Kavanaugh continues, says the president.
Rosenstein continues the task of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is doing research on the Russian election, as well as the conference between Trump and Russia and the blocking of the law arm by the president
The fact that Trump does not expel the representative around him, at the risk of Mueller’s independence, has been a cause of much gossip in Washington in the past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said he would wear a piece of clothing to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president with an adjustment 25
Rosenstein denied this report.
But on the last day he went to the White House House, in the midst of the reports he was going to resign.
Instead, meetings together
Trump said that he would not ‘ choose ’ to dismiss Roystein but that the conference was delayed to condemn the confrontation in the Commite for which Kavanauugh and one of the sex offenders, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both have witnessed.
On Friday, Tump commissioned a one-week survey of the FBI on a controversy against Kavanaugh, which has brought the full vote of the Senate vote.
Trump’s journalist, Mr. Sarah Sanders, appeared on Forx News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting at Rosenstein, he said: "The date that you haven't been used, or not this week, I saw that a return of the week was given all other things to the high court.
But we will see and always like to keep the press updated.
Some scholars object to this: The Sanders had not conducted the White House line since September 10.
The stream Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of explanations was not due to the confusion of TV vendors, although he said: "I will not agree with the fact that they watch."
He suggested a direct contact between the Trump and the mount point.
"The President created Q&A sessions and sessions instead of any president before," he added without identifying the evidence: "We look for those numbers."
Reports are going to take place, Sanders said, but "If a printer has a chance to ask the president of America exactly questions, it is better to talk to me.
We try to do so and have seen him do much more in the last few weeks, and it will take place in the case of the president of the United States.
Trump always carries questions when leaving White House or participating in open sessions or joining assemblies with passing phrases.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, he made freeheeling and some rare times before meeting the news.
The health secretary writes to the EU staff in NFS Scotland about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the Scottish staff in NFS to express their national gratitude and wish that they live in Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to the distance from the UK to the EU.
The Scottish government has devoted itself to meeting the costs of the EU’s requests for public services.
In his letter, Mrsz Freeman wrote: "During the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, focusing on the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK Government has organized its preparations for an impossible situation.
I know that this should be a very disturbing thing for all of you.
That is why I also want to value the contribution of the entire staff, no matter how much.
The brothers from all over the EU, and more and more, bring important experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, and have benefited the sick and the society we are using.
Skotland is your residence and we want you to stay here.
Abercrombie Chrisby Ingories Emergency Agency After Hearing Head Injury
Tennessee State State Backbacker Crossy Abercrombie was selected immediately after head abuse on Saturday 31-27 in Vanderbilt Commodores, a report by Mike Organ.
The instructor of the State of Tennessee, Russell Reed, told the press that it was possible to get hurt soon before a short time.
"He came to the side line and fell down," says Reed.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie in the field in the way before putting him on the rock and returning him to the test.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not open to the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is no ‘ information about the type/ size of injury at present" and Tennessee State tries to determine if injury is possible.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore (Januor at the University, but only in their 2th year of college football), the first vacation and the State of Tennessee after being transferred to Illinois.
She had five armed forces on Saturday before she left the game, which brought her full time to 18 challenges.
Revenue customers will be charged with buying a UK protein
Foreign customers will be paid when they buy a UK protein and additional funds used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
The rise will reduce the Corbyn success of driving to attract small voters.
The increase in the work of the stamp will be paid by those who do not pay the UK tax.
Nondlobo is expected to rise to £ 120 million annually to assist the homeless.
Sales of other goods are used to pay for the high quality of the work of the stamps when buying UK - and additional goods used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring them today.
The rise will seem to be an attempt to reduce the success of the Jeremy Corbyn drive to attract small voters by vows to provide for purchased houses and to focus on getting higher ones.
The increase in the work of the stamp will be paid by the people as well as the UK tax - free factories, as well as the additional money to improve the Russian driving against sleep.
The additional fee to the current work of the camps is included in the high levels placed in the last two years in the two homes and in the purchase and renting capacity of about 30 percent.
Nombo is expected to rise to £120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new buildings built in London are purchased by UK residents, to drive costs and to make it difficult for the first buyers to get foot on the level of housing.
Many of the world’s rich neighborhoods — especially in the cathedrals — have become ‘ villages ’ because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend their time in the country.
A new policy will come about a week after Boris Johnson asks that the stamp be cut off to help new people with their homes.
He persecutes large firms in the construction of high-rate property but does not use it, and he implored Nsz May to leave the platforms in the purchased homes to repair the ‘ disgrace of houses ’ of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has brought up a list of proposed house maintenance projects, including the control of the lab and the end of the removal.
He also wants to offer many large firms to build new homes.
Msz May said: "Last year I said I was going to give your Premiership to restore Britain's dream - for a better life for each new generation.
And that means making up our house - to - house business.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and make life here.
Even so, it would not be easy for blind people in the UK, as well as for outside companies, to buy homes as hard - working British people.
For so many people the dream of home ownership has been very far away, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains real.
Jack Ross: 'My highest chest is to control Scotland'
The Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that his "highest desire" is to be a Scottish Officer at a certain point.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of restoring the North-Eas East library, which is now living in the third place in the League One, three tops.
He moved to the Stadium of Light on this small spot after leading St Merren to the Remiership of the Scottish Season.
I want to play my country as an athlete.
I have B bulls and, "Ross has told BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Heenden so much and like a child, and it remains my protection.
That time will come, however, if I won the club management.
Ross as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio
The former officer of the Allatian Athletic says that he did not have the courage to follow cross names in a large classroom, which has already cast away places from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"A success in me at this time will be followed by 'Can I return this cable to the Chief of the League?'
Because of the construction and facilities in the game, there is no doubt that the Premier League, he said.
"It's not easy to find there, but I'll probably only watch if I win here to return to the group."
Ross for only three years in his colabor, later as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days in the Coachingstaff.
She then helped Alloa to break out of the third eye, and changed St Merren from the standard of the Campionship level on the following part.
And Ross says that he feels more at ease than he had at his play in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be a real thing," she recalls, by taking Alloa.
"I truly believe that control is good for me, more than to play.
It sounds so good because I did the right thing, made a good life in it, and I enjoyed it very much.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to do with each week.
I am still going that way in terms of pressures and pressure of work, but the control feels correct.
I always wanted to be in control and now do it, feeling free to be in my bag throughout my life.

The total time of the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, research is seen
The summer heatave type has encouraged the release of heavy British bridges but more rigid in the eating stores.
Pub and bar groups saw the sale of 2.7 percent in July - but taking from restaurants fell to 4.8 percent, showing the number.
Peter Martin, of the consultantity CGA, which included these numbers, said: "The continuing of the sun and England longer than you are expected to participate in the Black World Cup followed the same example in the last June year, when the pubs rose by 2.8 percent, unless the dining places were hard.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the merchant market in June was particularly high in July.
Drinking outlets and overexploited restrictions are more like a love of more than the lower dining rooms.
Food - guided pubs were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not as extreme as eating drivers.
It seems that people want to get out of the alcohol.
In all the tubs handled and drinking restrictions were over 6.6 percent of the month, with 3 percent of the food.
Paul Newman, a social analyst and host, says: "These effects continue with the spirit we have seen since April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain high as far as the market is concerned.
Not surprisingly, the shops continue to fight, although the market rate of sales of 4.8 percent a year will be particularly severe at the cost of constant expenses.
A long-term hot summer that has not come at a very bad time to the drivers who lead food and time will tell that the temperature taken in August will give plenty of breath.
The general increase in the demand for pub and shops, including the new opening, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating the development of the brown uts.
The Coffer Peach Traveler of the UK pub, bar and resubordination section gather and calculate the working data from 47 active groups, and the combined prices of more than 9 million, and the standard treatment indicator.

One of five children, such as three children — with State secret accounts hidden from their parents and teachers, the study shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated the growth in the pages of the "false Insta."
The news has raised the possibility that sexual activity is suspended in these channels
Twenty percent of students say they have an account that is "chief" to show their parents
One of five children, like 11 small children - create social accounts that keep a secret to adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the "Instroduction" account for the Instragram channel site.
The news has raised the fear that the sex theme is sent out.
Twenty percent of the students say they carry on a "professal" account to show the parents, when alone.
One mother who stumbled at her 13-year-old daughter found a girl touching others to ‘ rape me. ’
Research, with Digial Ayernessness and Chief Chief (HMC) of independent schools, has found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18, with two reports, and half of those who agreed to keep their accounts.
HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It distracts many new people from creating Internet sites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eliidh Doyle will be the ‘ sound of the players ’ on the Scottish Attics board
Eliidh Doyle is selected from the Scottish Attics as the non-ruler at the general annual assembly.
Doyle is a Scottish driver and co-oper of Scotland and the Internet chairman Ian Beattie described walking as a good opportunity for those who lead the games to benefit from his international experience in the past ten years.
"Eilidh has great respect for the whole of Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we are sure that Scotland's Athlétics will benefit from removing him from the board," says Bettie.

A postal monitor by measuring mothers and cattle to separate the Internet opinion
The pump company of the breast has classified the commercialization of the Internet as well as an advertisement that identifies the young mothers of the captured cattle.
To set up the introduction of what is called "the first openable bug," the industrial company of Elvie released the title of mic-in-cheek a inspired video display to show the new freedom the pump offers to identify mothers.
Four mothers have a dance in the Barn filled with cattle in lines including sounds like "Aye, I’m a woman, but you don't see a tail" and "If you didn't notice these things, it's not so."
The corrus continues: "Pumttt, pamptt, feeding, pumping, pumping, and putting my daughters in.."
However, the advertisement, printed on the File Name page, created a conflict online.
In the 77,000 visions and hundreds of sounds, the video has received detailed answers to viewers, many saying it means ‘ disturbed ’ in the milk industry.
‘ The proper solution is to use cattle to advertise this product.
As we say they have to get pregnant and deliver milk, unless their babies are told before the days of childbirth, "let's write one.
The chest gun of Elvie harmonizes closely inside a storage vessel (Elvie / mother)
Another said: ‘ The anxiety clearly comes to both mother and child.
But why not use them to publish a pump pump in mothers who will keep their children?
Another person added: "Innocuous in sales."
Others defend the declaration, a woman admits that she has received a "pure."
"I think this is a human idea.
I will be alone if I satisfy myself.
I felt like a cow.
The announcement was somewhat painful, but I accepted it.
This is the product of the mind, "one wrote.
Another said: "This is a good advertising directed to the mother of the pumps (usually in their workshops or in private places) and feel like ‘ cattle.'
This is not an advertisement that glorifies or condemns the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all playing with a troubled pump.
The theme behind the project is based on the sense that many famous women in the seminary feel like cattle.
The Elvie Pump, completely silent, has no wire or parasites and is firmly consistent within the canvas, gives women freedom to walk, hold their children, and get out.
Ana Balin, a partner and ECD to Mother, said: "Elvie's steam is like a product of a change that was due to the beginning of courage and touch.
By pointing out the similarity between the women and the milk cows that we wanted to put on breast - feeding and all the obvious problems, while showing the fun and the appearance of the new freedom that will bring about a new freedom.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump has made a subject.
During the end of the Mondon week, the mother of two children appeared in the soundtale of Mara Jabowski while using this product.
Many of the Peoples of the River are busy in the Texas Borderr Camp
The number of children used to move out although the movements of the moon remain constant, in view of the fact that heavy control and management policies made by Trump make it difficult to place children and support.
Traditionally, many of the supporters have become foreign, and they threaten their ability to live in the country by further calling the child.
The danger increased in June, when government authorities announce that all potential clients and other older members of their homes should wear fingers, and if the party will share with the authorities.
Last week, The Tateu Alence, the top executive and the turning of the Bossel and the Disposable Disposition Act, testified before the Conference that the minister should hold many people who apply for the support of children who are not involved.
The attorney later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have records of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who support them or family members who are in this country illegally, and the great majority of these foreigners are lawbreakers.
So we continue to pursue those people, says Mr. Alence.
In order to advance the children quickly, the authorities promised new laws that would require others to appear in court in a month of detention, shortly after 60 days, the former rules, in terms of the residence staff.
Many would appear to be rather than a telephony, rather than a person, to defend their position in the case of the move judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
After a long period of time for children to stay in the cell, they may say that they can become anxious or depressed, resulting in eventually or out of control, according to the show crews and reports that have appeared on the program in the months ahead.
Proponents say that this concern is raised in a major institution such as Tornillo, where the symptoms of a child’s difficulty may be forced, because of its size.
They add that taking the children to the tent town without providing enough time to prepare for themselves physically or to say that as friends they would be responsible for much of the damage they were having to do with it.
Syria tells the US, French, and Turkey that it is too fast
In view of the United Nations Assembly, foreign President Walid al-Moulam also called the Syrians home, although the civil war is now the eighth year.
Mouleam, also serving as an ambassador of the state, has declared the foreign Syrian armies illegally, under the sense of combating power, and shall be taken properly.
"They should be dismissed immediately and without restriction," said the congregation.
Mouleem emphasized that ‘ the war of an event is going on in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions of other people were displaced from their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we have finished the rest of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, generally training and counseling the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Baasha al-Assad.

In the case of the refugees, Moulelem said that these restrictions were suitable for their return, and he said, "Some Western countries" because of spreading unreasonable fears that cause refugees to live far away.
"We have called international territories and human organizations for this payment," he said.
"They have dealt with what needs to be a concern of the people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will not be a restructuring of Syria until a political treaty between Assad and opposition to the end of war.
UN General Assembly states that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey is to be established at the level of the Tammpon, the Idib belbelli tower created an opportunity for further development in political terms.
The Russian-Tuchan speech attacked a major assault on healthy Russian people, where three million people lived.
Moulem but insisted that the agreement was ‘ a long time' and expressed the hope that the war party would focus on the jihadists and the A-Qaeda-asda soldiers, which were associated with Nsra Front's Destruction.
UN delegate Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon connect the first meetings of a new committee organized by the members of the government and opposition to the designing of the Syrian military constitution and the administration of the choice.
Moulelem put the circumstances of the support of the Syrian Government on the committee, which says that the panel's work must be prevented from "renewing current principles," and warned about the disturbance.

The Department of State decided to return the American delegates to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama about the "predictions soon to be destroyed to see Taiwan," says Heather Nauert, speaking for the Department, in terms of the House, in the statement this month.
But the sentences were considered only about El Salvador, which received $140 million about American Aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.

Mr Mueller is said to have answered his research and that Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked with Russia in its attack of our choice.

Speaking at the West Virginia conference, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Foeyi before the Court of Courts, instead of focusing on that what happened in the Senete shows that people were ‘ speaking and investigating and being firm.
One thing that can happen and a good thing is going on during the last few days of Senette, when you see anger, when you see people burning and speaking, and when they don't say, he said.
"When you look for a discharge and leak and say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you swear?
Remember his reply ... are you paying for the "o, what, what?
Oh no.
I didn't wake up.
Yes, wait a minute.
Did we match ... No, we didn't go out, "Add, to the pioneer level.
Feinstein sent a letter writing about Kavanauugh by Fordon in July, and it survived early September - but Feinstein rarely had any interest in his office.
"I didn't hide the F Ford Reports, I didn't break his story, "Feinsstein told the committee, the Hill reported.
"He asked me if I held it secretly and kept it as he asked."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who said on Saturday night: ‘ I will tell you, that was extremely serious.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst type of body I had seen.
To further the defense of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual immorality by three women, the president stated that Democracy is used for their sentences.
"They are determined to restore power in any way needed.
He sees the meaning, the injustice, who is not concerned about who is doing wrong, who must work to take power and control, "Mediate has reported the president," says.

Microscopic plane crash: Air Niugini said one person was lost after a car crash
Airline that disturbed the Pacific ragoon in Micronesia now says that one man is lost, after all 47 passengers and crew were safely moving in a crash.
Air Niugini freely said that on Saturday afternoon, she could not answer the man with whom she was traveling.
The Airline said she was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find a man.
Airline did not respond quickly to many applications regarding the passenger, such as his time or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after they hit the water while attempting to reach the Chuuk Island airport.
The police said that on Friday seven persons were arrested in a hospital
The Airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
What made the orderly sequence of events so easy to see so - called contagion and accuracy to come up with.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy both reportedly reached the nearest port.
Other witnesses imagined that the chariot was moving across the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came just too low.
The best thing is, "Jaynes says.

He described the order of the use of telephone records to connect with the rise of 29 years, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of death.
Rowlett said that he found a lot of space on the many cell phones that showed that Tisis had a Chamber on the evening of his death, contradicting his earlier arguments, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the phone rang out that his cell phone had been with Chambers for some time, Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
The Sanford took a stand on Saturday and proved that he was not in the city that day.
When the persecutors asked if Tellis was right when he said that he was at Sanford's station that night, Sanford said, ‘ he was too narrow, for my truck is going to Nashville.
Another paradox is that Tellis has known Cenders about two weeks after his death.
Telephone records show that they know only one week.
Rowlett said that after the death of Chambers, Tellis was removed from the cat Chambers, telephones, and personal contact information on his phone.
"He wiped him off his face," said Hare.
The protection is set up to start their Sunday - closed discussions.

Another black man!
NY nyny littles two after firing after the word "racial"
The New York nany tells the couple quoted after finding a wrong text from a mother complaining about the "one black man."
The couple deny that they are prejudiced, likening suit to "robbering."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new child's service provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day in the project in 2016.
"EUSER OF ONE YOUNG," wrote Nksz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a passage.
Even so, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After observing her gaffe, the "not troubled" Plasco-Flaxman was expelled by Mrsz Maurice, saying that their dying nany, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and instead of expecting Philipno, according to the New York Post.
Msz Maurice was paid one job day and returned home by Uber.
Now, Maurice straightens out the couple for return, and she needs to pay for $350 a day in 6 months, if she does not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding, "I know you are against."
The couple had filed racist charges, saying that Maurice’s resignation was a reasonable thing to do, fearing that they would trust her after she provoked him.
"My wife sent you something that I don't want to say.
He is no part of a human race.
They are not racial people, "the husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you put your children into the hands of someone who was quick to act, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come.."
Comparing a suit to "robber," Plasco said that his wife was only two months old if she had a child and she was a "hard".
"Will you follow such a person?
That is not the best thing to do, "the investment bank."
Although the case continues, the human court quickly checks the couple quoted from the media, complementing their behavior and ideas.
The publishers in Paddington feared that the students did not keep up with the spoken text, a new publication showing them
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said: "It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it was printed.
I am amazed now to know about the great success in Paddington.
He says that his father, who had served as BBC Cameraman before being inspired to write a book for children on a small Bible, would be a rare man about his rare work, adding that 60 years after his death the book was a good thing of the past year.
In Paddington, describing as "the most important member of the family," he added to his father automatically relied on his success.
"He was an adult, and was not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to him, it was hard for him to have a child to achieve something: he is proud of himself though it is not real.
I think he had seen Paddington’s success in that way.
Although he was his creation and his opinion, he always gave him a debt to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to confide in her over the phone
In the neighborhood her daughter had been rushed to a hospital at Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors had been working for no apparent reason to save her life.
"Nad regularly called if it was wrong, if she didn't expect him to do it," said Mrs. Edna-Lapehouse.
"After that I received a call from Nad that he was going to die within two minutes, and I had to tell him.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, and I love you."
I will be with you in the near future.
I will be with you.
The doctors had given her to keep her heart beating so quickly that she had abandoned her system.
She did not have any time in front of her hand, and this was all shut down.
I just had to stay and wait, knowing that it all happened.
I was not able to cry or cry because I was placed in a condition surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold together.
Dr. Ednan-Lapehouse, now painfully at the loss of his daughter, finally boarded an airplane with other passengers who were unaware of the problem she was in.
"No one knew."
"I touched my head, and tears were known all the time.
It was hard to explain, but it was in this spirit that I could feel this kind of kindness toward Nad.
If she needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved her.
Bridge-resisted card users
Two women who have lost a loved one in death attempt to protect others from suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge as well as encouraging messages and telephone numbers to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyndale was 13 years old when he began to experience depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I would feel daily," she said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with an infectious disease.
"Everyone knew because of his smile.
They were always talking about his smile.
Nevertheless, she quit work before she died, as she was ‘ in a dark place. ’
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the only one who could find his brother after he was alive.
Msz Davis said: "I am always concerned that there will be a knock on the door.
Ms Davis created cards, "Let people know that there are people outside where you can talk to them, even if I have a friend.
Don't keep peace - you need to talk."
Msz Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after Mother's death.
"He didn't mean he was feeling down or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her attitude.
She was in a quiet place at Christmas when the children opened their gifts and didn't have any contact with them.
He said that his death was the greatest victim of them, but they had to work with it: "He boasts a hole in the family.

Brett Kavanaugh’s future depends on insurance as the FBI begins research
"I thought, if we could find something like it was asking for - a short time, it is limited at a time in which we perhaps enter a little unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, he added that he had avoided the committee "division between the connected gridlock.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republic supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Not everything is wanted for time.
The final election takes place five weeks, November 6 - if, as expected, the Riphashites do wrong, so they will be too weak in their efforts to find a man in the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has been calling the Seniors, asking him to cooperate with Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the House in the West with Mr Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush. Bush.
What happened after the FBI issued its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 49 Republics and Democratics now sit.
It is not clear that Mr Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes on the Senate level, which will allow Mike Pence, the president, to break the box and convince him of the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defector Number ' descended' under Kim
The number of North Korean authorities to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un had power seven years ago, said a South Korean representative.
A park Bying-seug, which mentioned the data from the South friendly service, said there was 1,127 security in the previous year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the transverse control between North Korea and China and the high levels paid by the central suppliers.
Pyonging did not create public opinion.
Most of the victims from the North are eventually donated by South Korea’s residents.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled into China, with the longest border in North Korea and it is easy to cross the Dilitised Zoo (DMZ) Region between two Koreas.
China refers to the victims as illegal migrants rather than runaways and frequently return again and again.
The relationship between the Northern and the South — which has been practicable in the war has been particularly successful in the following months.
Earlier this month, leaders of two countries met in Pyongingh for talks that focused on the conference.
This occurred after the June conference of the American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work in a non-nular Korean Pencil.
But on Saturday, North Korean President Ri Yong-ho says that the US sentences are due to a lack of progress.
"Unless faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no way we will abuse us first," says Mr U to the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelolisi calls Brett Kavanaugh, saying he is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court
The Small House Leader Nancy Pelolisi called the Supreme Court chief Brettt Kavanaugh and said that she was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelousi gave the answers in a Saturday discussion at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think if the woman has ever done that way, they'd say they'd be happy," Pelousi said about her response to Kavanaugh before the Court of Courts on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was officially recognized that she was smoking with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During the opening session, Kavanaugh felt very tense, at times calling and talking to her family and at other times during her high school years.
He judged clearly the democracys on the committee, calling the charges against him of the ‘ inter-compliant and man-organcies" compiled by the rare institutions if Hillary Clinton had lost a national election of 2016.
Pelousi says that she believes in Kavanau full evidence that she could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that she was abused by Democrats.
"I think you are ready for such explanations and how they follow the Clintons and Democratics," he said.
Pelousi was stressed when asked that she would try to interfere with Kavanaugh if she was assured, and if Democracy gets more from the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress or the FBI, so he doesn't qualify to be the Supreme Court, but if he is in court now," says Pelousi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of the Kavanaugh Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is viewed as the righteousness which you maintain.
In his confirmation of the detention, Kavanaugh had answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a dangerous, private person to go to court and expect us to say, 'No,' says Pelousi.
And women want to protect it.
The diatribe is good, moon and years of hot anger, and he cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mr.
"I don't think of something strange, isn't it?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a ruler in a certain place, who said that she also wept when she cried, but she developed a process which meant that when she was full and started to cry, she said to the person she spoke to, "You think I’m sorry because I was crying."
I have a sound.
And she kept on walking.
And I thought there was wisdom.
Tears are allowed to flow as a result of another sort of irritation because of a misunderstanding.
One of my more severe reminders than the first job, in the male office, where I found myself crying out with a terrible rage, was I caught up with scruff on my neck by an older woman; I always have a fear - I’m too afraid of anyone who drives me to the platform.
"Don't let them see their cry," he told me.
"He doesn't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and that you will be happy that they are coming to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democraticwoman Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his office.
In 1986, when Mr Hart was held in a bridge outside Monkey and out of the race, Mrsz Schroeder, he was very concerned, he might have thought he had no reason to get the idea of running the president himself.
"There was no good decision," he said with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in the contest, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called the "Now White and the seven favorites."
Because it was after the project, it was after financial support, and she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters who gave 1,000 to the men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I get something?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech telling that he would not put up a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude, frustration, and a system that made it more difficult to raise and appoint voters than delegates, as well as anger at sexism - if he was mature.
"You think I'm going to be upset," recalls Mrsz Schroeder about how the printer reacted to him.
"You think Klenee was my company’s client.
Do I recall thinking, ‘ Will I place them on my rock - mass? ’
"Have you stopped"? "
How the US-Y China War can be a good thing in Beijing
Salvos the opening of the war between the US and China was deaf, and when the fighting was far away, conflicts between countries could be useful for Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the US, dismissed the first warning early in the year by absorbing the Chinese foreign speeches involving sun panels, iron and aluminum.
A significant increase was planned this week with new payments affecting $200 billion (£50 million) worth of goods, properly taxing all the goods that come to the US from China.
Beijing is replayed and repeated immediately, the castoffs have recently paid a 2 to 1 percent for $60 million.
China has promised to match the US short-shot-shot, and most of the world economy is not possible to connect any time soon.
Getting Washington to go back means taking the requirements, but bowing down to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can properly play its cards, the pressure of the US wars can certainly help China over a period of time by reducing international dependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that begin to discard the country's economy is really more dangerous than the spectators have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an experienced friend of Asia, says that the New American Security Culture, the thinking tank.
Syria 'has prepared refugees to return, ’ says the General of the Nations
Syria says that it is ready to go back to the refugees and promotes the reconstruction of a nation destroyed by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation is certainly grateful for the progress made in the prevention of violence," he said.
The State goes on to rebuild damaged areas in order to restore the habit.
All situations are now in which refugees willingly return to the country where they have fled as a result of violence and economic instability that do not center on their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living there need human help.
Al-Moulem said that the kingdom of Syria would receive help in rebuilding a devastated land.
But he stressed that he would not accept limited help or help from the countries that support it.
