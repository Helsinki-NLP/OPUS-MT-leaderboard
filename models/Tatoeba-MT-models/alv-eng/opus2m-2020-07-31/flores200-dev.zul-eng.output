This kind of thinking is connected with some sort of scientific or technological design.
People who have this type of thinking are able to think logically, memorize illustrations, solve problems, and engage in scientific experiments.
Humans are creatures with the greatest ability to learn the thoughts of others.
This means that we can successfully foretell what other people see, plan, believe, know, and desires.
