You have to get it.
Why at home?
Asa and my father.
Do not give up.
I am a new person here.
I shall not be too lenient.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why don’t we go there together?
We’ll see each other again!
Relief at last!
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I am sure I saw him in some way.
You are a good person.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Better it would be if you didn’t do it.
I am not hungry.
I am still a middle - school student.
I lost my keys.
We are not alone.
I want to know that.
May I ask, What good are you doing in this regard?
No one really knew what was needed.
It made me wonder.
I’m one of your classmates.
Why not learn French?
Not at all.
I want to see you.
Happily, I’m glad you are there.
When does it rise?
Does Tom know why?
What is my hour?
We don’t have any money.
Forgive me!
I do not need them.
I told my parents about it.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
Yes.
Not only is it cold but it is also slippery.
I lost my pen.
When do you get up?
You can find any of those pictures that appeal to you.
She had prepared it for use in preparing it.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Will You Be There?
I want to save it for you.
Do you want to be rich?
I no longer have a head.
If you do not hear, they will come.
He is my father.
I’m curious about that.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he’s coming.
I’m not sure.
He was said to be very rich.
His words were, in effect, a miracle.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows for sure except his parents.
I was able to do that.
I don’t think he’s coming.
He was cut to the heart.
The sun is bright in the east.
Why not do so?
It will be wonderful.
There is no problem.
I remember the first time I was here.
Would you like to take them?
By what kind of name?
You avoid me that I’m saying the same thing.
My older brother was not at home.
My parents called me in and around the world.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother or a sister?
Now look at the picture.
I’m in my car.
What can you do?
Is this your mother?
Why does heaven look like blue?
If you do not understand, they will come.
We own a car.
No one has a car here.
Choose for Us!
I’m not sure.
Light.
I’m glad you are with me.
Are you looking for us?
Forget that!
What is that advantage?
I don’t have any privileges.
My daughter will be married in the sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you are talking about.
It makes me feel good.
Where do you know my name?
Would you like to?
Is it love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December is 12 months of year.
I have a question.
I heard you got married.
Would you like to travel?
In the past, he was a teacher.
Take her for granted.
I was stunned!
Who do you think I am?
I have seen it come true.
You would like to see it.
Vows are made voluntarily, of one’s own free will.
I don’t have any lovers.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want to have something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
You must be devastated.
Take a few steps to find it in the hotel.
Would you not agree?
He is there!
No, it does not.
I do not know how long they will have to wait.
Whose image is this?
May I come back?
Let them escape!
No one knows what to do.
Do not look at yourself down.
I’ll have to ask him.
We returned.
I’ll see you.
I know so many things about you.
There is no problem.
I want to learn French.
My car broke down.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is going on.
He left his car key behind.
Why don’t you go home?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate sheep from goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I'm going to send you to school.
Do I Know Tom?
Are you satisfied?
Should I Return?
That is why I love you.
Are you one?
It will be warm.
Please give me a copy.
It’s for the first time.
It is too hot.
You know I love you.
The bed is hot and humid.
Our trip comes from time to time.
I accepted the money.
What do you want to see?
How Do You Go to School?
Are you a new person?
I know what to do.
Do You enjoy studying?
Do you have your money?
I’m not sure.
I know what is going on.
What are these sandals?
Happily, I’m glad you are there.
It is a fine book.
Thank you for killing me at home.
I respect them.
I’m so scared!
She is strong.
Here are five dollars.
I went to my mother.
It is perfect.
Your life is dirty.
My emotions are stirred for you.
Thank you.
Do You enjoy studying?
I will give you.
Enjoy a meal.
I want the same for myself.
You are my friend.
What is our car?
No one knows what to do.
Which school do you attend?
You are not interested in it!
He is a good student.
I’ll have to think about that.
Get a copy of the book and read it.
I don’t have a house.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I think about it.
Happy he is.
I became envious.
I’m not sure.
Not at all.
You are welcome to come home.
My daughter will be walking without her.
He was raised by his grandmother.
Do not do that.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my sister.
I had to make my own clothes.
How long would you like to continue?
I leave home in the morning before two o'clock in the morning.
I quit my lottery.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We need not wonder.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are my beloved wife.
I’ll be happy with you.
It is up to us.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Do not say the same thing over and over again.
Now I’m going to send it to you.
Where are we going?
I’m not sure.
You know where I am.
What is your purpose as a journey?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
Stop the car.
I’m not sure.
Do you know what to do?
We know.
No thanks.
Where do you want to be?
I love the environment in which I live.
Do not ask.
Should I Keep My Eyes on the Prize?
A few drops of rain are dropped.
Where are you going?
No matter how happy you are, you feel.
You have to go home.
Are they here?
Do you learn French?
You will be truly repentant.
Make a visit on me.
What is my car?
I don’t know how.
There I met my sister.
I know what I’m doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I do the same for you.
This girl is dressed like a boy.
I do not have a brother or a sister.
Sadly, my best friend moved to another city.
Do they belong to you?
You know I must go.
It is your book.
It is not my day.
How long has he been sick?
If he had remained at home on that day, there would have been no accident.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I am not happy.
I know what is going on.
I know.
Good, No.
I know what you think.
You’re hot.
It was not enough, so I had to change it.
Better it would be if you didn’t do it.
This girl is dressed like a boy.
I like the way you people speak.
I have to clean my hair.
Too small?
The owner is my brother.
I am happy and have inner joy.
Do you have time to respond to that need?
Let him do it.
I do not know how to give names.
Do You Know What Love Is?
There will be Saturday.
I would not die.
Tell me about your plans.
Is the book on display free of charge?
I lost my pen.
Thank you to come.
I’m a cook.
There is a man standing behind the wall.
I quit school.
Make it clear.
Did you notice it?
Are they looking upon us?
Are you a good worker?
When I climbed out of the valley, I was struck down.
Is that the case?
We did.
They are all children.
How Can I Make Worship of Jehovah Enjoyable?
Keep in mind, though, that you need to do more than simply forget to deliver a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a way.
I go to school here too.
I don’t have one sister.
I also had a bullet on my hand.
What do you see?
Shyness.
Do you know where?
What is your father’s role?
Do not call me over again.
My father is at home.
Spinning is more likely to be effective.
Are they Japanese?
Hand me a copy of the book.
You are a good person.
The windows are positioned south.
I forgot to buy some bread.
I am on the day of Jehovah.
I don’t see it.
Where do you come from?
Here we come to the crux of the matter.
I don’t know where he lives.
There is a hundred people in a hall.
I understand that.
The tooth has no teeth.
Not at all.
My dream had come true.
You can.
And what can I say...
Do you know where?
I am not a college student.
Let me see.
Are you our part?
Follow the course of goodness toward those who hate it.
With no exception.
They are very small.
The steps of the stork are not used today.
We are so happy.
She is attractive.
The door is my home.
I am no better than a carpenter.
I’m not sure.
Tell them what happened.
You are welcome to come home.
I did it for you.
I like your vehicle.
Who is your teacher?
Are you on your way?
Does it appeal to you?
Yes.
Undoubtedly.
Did I like it?
I’m not sure.
Happily, I’m glad you are there.
I need to feel that I am not a victim.
I dropped you off.
Do not get embroiled in negotiations or endlessly discuss why you are upset.
I don’t know what to think about.
I don’t know what to do.
What is behind this trend?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
Money spent.
I want to buy a car.
I want to go too.
They do not look for a way out.
What is your hour?
We parted on good terms.
Of course not!
I lost my keys.
I don’t understand this.
I haven’t cared for you today.
I’m looking for you.
Please, separate from me.
I enjoy your vehicle.
He was said to be very rich.
No one can be certain.
Going or Not?
We don’t.
There was a temple in ancient times.
I know you said that.
Oh, yes.
Why not go home?
Is that how you feel?
I don’t have any privileges.
What do you want to see?
Why do you ask?
He is there!
I don’t have a good time.
I’m sure you’re strong.
Be willing.
I know that girl.
They did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Fulfill your schoolwork.
I want to accompany you.
All I know is his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will rejoice with you.
We can grasp that.
What is the family’s condition?
I speak a little Spanish.
Keep at it!
How old is he?
I’ve got to know why.
You are not my brother.
My family is small.
Does Tom know why?
Are they at home?
I love mathematics.
I know what to do.
With no exception.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
Of course not!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you find them?
I don’t know one word of French.
When do you go?
They have no money.
Let them tell you what happened.
Is the phone number correct?
I don’t have any strength.
It is not French.
Look at me!
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
They did.
Does It Have All to Do With Travel?
I haven’t cared for you today.
He nodded.
Are you our part?
It is not something to be proud of.
I'm going up!
I love this car.
I know where to turn for guidance.
Yours is like yours.
How much is paid?
The bearings are different.
Not out of sight!
Where do you want to be?
Look at it.
No one listened to me.
Keep in mind, though, that you need to do more than simply forget to deliver a letter.
We’re here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes off.
They know us.
When do you get up?
I will not give up.
From England.
You avoid me that I’m saying the same thing.
Let me explain.
The windows are open.
You do not have to come.
No one listened.
I will never forget it.
I don’t think he’s coming.
There is no problem.
rice is a choice.
I know how it works.
Nobody asked.
They want us to do so.
What do you see outside?
I’m sure you enjoy it.
I shall never be there.
Where is Tom?
Is this French?
The owner of the books is my sister.
From tomorrow onward, we can go to work.
We arrived.
I learn French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they will go.
It is an amazing book.
Our arms are outstretched.
I know your father.
I was studying the French language at school.
You have to go home.
Where do all people go?
Can you open a window?
Will you go to the summer?
Where is my mother?
Otherwise — when?
Is that what you are looking for?
What is your car?
My father was not at home.
There is no question about it.
Do you know what it is?
He is equal to all that he has to offer.
Are you looking for them?
No wealthy people live there.
There is a bullet in the jaw.
You know him.
I would be happy to see him.
My father was not at home.
Ah, here we are!
What’s Wrong With Telephone?
You can sing a song.
Forgive me, please!
I know how to do that.
We are envious.
I’m sure you can understand them.
Where are we going?
Love is blind.
Let me explain.
I know you have.
I am not a student.
I’ll try.
A strong wind blows, and I cannot move.
Probably not.
I saw my sister there.
I do not give up.
How much time will you spend on it?
Asa, and his father.
What is that?
You have been given a choice.
My house is near a place of worship.
On one occasion, he even deviated from true worship.

No one knows his name.
Do you know where they are?
Where do you go to school?
What is it?
What a thought!
He gave it to me.
I never saw him.
What are these?
We listen to them.
Why do people say that?
Elaborate carpets have considerable value.
I have vowed.
I do not understand French.
Not at all!
Why do I have to do that?
It’s Saturday.
So I did that.
I’m a cook.
How many?
We don’t have any money.
I know you will listen.
“ Throw your shoes out.
I know what you are like.
I am happy.
Is this new car?
Why don’t you join them?
She did not read this book.
I don’t want to be rich.
I am sorry that I did.
An animal has no teeth.
That will be joyful.
You can go.
When do you come home?
She did not read this book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is by no means new.
You know him.
French.
I don’t have a car.
Pay attention to your head.
Why not make a mental or a written list of what you have in mind?
I want you to see her.
You can use this vehicle.
I don’t know.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see that?
Don’t put it down!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought some eggs and two dozen eggs.
One copy is missing.
I saw him again.
Is this your mother?
I grew up in a family.
What was that purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
French.
He is a tall, big son.
I know who they are.
You know better.
I have a car.
When Will You Come?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 2: 00 a.m. is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You must stop drinking too much.
Follow your mother’s example.
There is a way.
Where did you stop?
I'm between one and two hour.
If you have snakes, kill yourself.
What do I wear?
Which book?
The Americans?
How do they look?
Look at me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not necessarily.
Would you like to meet them?
What are your possessions?
Is the fault always bad?
We don’t drink.
He is there!
I Will Not Give Up
I will step on such.
We are happy.
Keep it tidy and clean.
It shows me that they do not respect me.
I bring it in.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not really.
I was studying the French language at school.
Why?
I would like you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do you want to?
Honor your mother.
You know I must go.
What is a car?
Do you love him?
You must specify a balance between exiting and entries.
The serpent was too old to speak.
They do not ask today.
Do you know what to ask?
Open the Window!
It’s our home!
This son is his brother.
Why don’t you go to school?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I get in?
You know I love you.
Researchers have found the bones of a man in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see them again?
These measures can prevent the spread of disease.
That’s the factor.
We are told to eat at midday.
Do not get angry!
Not the time to chat. We'll just go to the movie.
I fell in love with him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am a new person here.
I want to learn French.
I’m going to find you.
I do not have a sister.
I’m sleeping on the floor of my room.
“ I have a one - on - one.
The water is very, very cold.
If only I had walked away!
I’m freer.
What Is the Price?
I know where we are.
Why did they not come?
I must carry my car with me.
Why not attend class?
We are students at a university.
I don’t know his name.
I don’t think so.
How Do You Go to School?
Forgive me!
Let them alone.
Do not hold back!
Do you know what it is?
I am sorry that I did.
I know his family.
I know what is going on.
I lost my keys.
This is what I do.
I don’t have any privileges.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
Tomorrow I ate eggs.
No, it does not?
We know him.
I need some rest.
Nobody asked.
We are envious.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about all of this.
I get up at one o’clock in the morning.
Do not open a window.
Have fun with this step.
Why not?
Why the heat?
Unless it is rain, she goes to work on her legs every day.
It is up to us.
Let us not look at the below.
How does your sibling feel?
Can we make an appointment with everyone?
Where are you going?
I loved this car.
Why do you learn French?
I think so.
I can see them.
I know you believe.
He accused the man of stealing.
I carried this right away.
I couldn’t believe my ears.
I don’t know their names.
Let me explain your goal.
I know what to do.
He was said to be very rich.
Your life is dirty.
In Germany, right?
Do you love it?
"These are too many?" – "Your father is my father."
You do not have to thank me.
What did you find next evening?
We want it to be.
Asa and his mother.
As an isolated one, let us enjoy each other’s company.
We have come to see you.
Would you like to?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want to have something to drink?
You never know what has happened, and do you remember what has happened?
I know what love is.
Not so.
The weapon exploded.
What are you doing here?
That’s the factor.
There was no one around.
We studied in one school.
When?
It made me wonder.
Do you have enough rice?
Are they here?
We do.
We are brothers and sisters.
I know why you are here.
Why do you study at a university?
What are these?
Soon — even suddenly — time will run out.
When will you come back?
I've stumbled.
Accept it.
Listen to your mother!
Read this.
I will give you.
What is the news?
They are in my room!
Is this a flat tire?
Do you want to have something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is bought?
I would like to read this book.
I have come from Brazil.
I’ll take you home.
We studied in one school.
Do Not Forget Us!
I’ll write all of us a letter.
Do not limit yourself; on each list, write down as many as possible.
Do you have this money?
They are very small.
It is his job.
That is what you have asked for.
She’s my sister.
What do you want?
Do they?
He was cut to the heart.
I want to see.
Stop making the rules here!
Sometimes we went to the cinema together.
You’re right, aren’t you?
Have you read this book?
Where should we go?
Why do we do it?
This is too tall.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There is an eternity in the cell.
She’s my sister.
It is his job.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They know nothing.
An American?
tea or tea?
What was going on?
I am sorry that I dropped you out of the trash.
We are on our own.
I love what I do.
My voice stiffens because of the diarrhea.
Do you know what he said?
His Word was intact.
When would you like to leave?
I do not understand such things.
Is that better?
Are they also in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing a lot of time.
Why not give up?
Offer an appropriate public discourse without being distracted by other languages.
And what is his family?
Magdalena andnia are two true friends.
I am happy and have inner joy.
We need to eat each other’s bread for day.
Take one.
Do you have a brother or a sister?
We got on together.
I’ll agree with that.
I’ll have to think about that.
Who is Mary?
I fell sick.
I have to finish.
I’m glad you are with me.
Do you think you were excited?
Why don’t you go too?
No one is at home.
By the way, my name is Karen.
She loved him.
She did not get pregnant.
Why does he leave me completely in the dark like this?
How much is left?
What did you give me?
Go outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
His face is intense; the brow is furrowed in concentration.
Not at all.
Stage!
I’ll take part.
How many nights?
Yes.
I was greeted by people with warm, friendly smiling faces.
You have to go home.
Asa, and his father.
You are told to go along with me.
Do you know where he is?
I was not happy.
Why don’t you go too?
Keep up the watch.
Do you have my money?
This present is a fine gift.
You are welcome to come home.
I don’t have one sister.
I don’t know.
I do not know how to capture the names.
Can You Recall?
I am sorry.
Do you know these people?
Is this a popular right?
Why do I do it?
I’m not sure.
This industry produces motorized vehicles.
I am not a student.
No, it is not.
Do not do that again.
Look Out in a window.
I was not happy.
One copy is missing.
He accepts the money.
Happy he is.
Staying in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to find them?
Remember that your kindness is not something you forget.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We want the meetings in the language on a daily basis.
So why did he bring him here?
I’m not sure.
I went to school.
Nobody said a word.
We are brothers and sisters.
It is too hot.
So I did that.
I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
It matters to him.
Are you happy?
You're our sister.
The goal?
I have no daughter anymore.
We are students at a university.
There is nothing new.
Are you ready to do that?
Can’t you enlarge on that?
No one ever saw it.
I’ll try.
I would like to ask you, Are you driven by a train?
I know that girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
They need water.
Where are they taking you?
There is no problem.
I love to.
How many cups of coffee did you take?
Who are these buildings?
This car is very desirable.
We understand it.
Our arms are outstretched.
We shall see.
Your report?
I know you have.
I am sorry to apologize for your rudeness.
Children.
I am a teacher.
We got off to the ground.
I can’t remember any names.
Do you want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
Never lie.
I am taking a university course.
These publications are for us.
They do not want us to know about it.
It’s not my car.
You are guided by the red light.
I know what I’m going to learn.
I miss you very much.
I’ll hear what you’re saying.
I want you to come home.
We go together.
Give an opportunity.
I am not strong.
Not at all!
It is not something to be proud of.
Can you understand French?
He gives me time to think.
It’s for the first time.
Who is the wine?
I have my sister.
It does not keep account of the injury.
You call on me for help.
I’m not one of them.
We moved away.
They are not rich people here.
What is he about to do?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is there!
We go there together.
We’ll do that over the next week.
I like the way you people dress.
What do you do?
I am dust.
Will they also come?
He knows that we love you.
You can distinguish both sheep and goats.
I’ll think about that.
No one listened to me.
I love to learn French.
Perhaps we can take them along the coast at this end of the week.
Why?
Would you not agree?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I know.
I Will Not Give Up
He doesn't seem to be happy.
I know where to turn for guidance.
Unless the rains come, he goes to work all day long.
Thank you very much!
