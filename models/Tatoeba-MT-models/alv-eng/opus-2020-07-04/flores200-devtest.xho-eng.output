Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Nearly everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries it is at the same time heard the same amount of water level and the falls of bridges.

Car travel is a study of the movements of every driver and car from place to place and of how they deal with each other.
Unfortunately, learning the flow of traffic is difficult because the driver’s arms cannot be fully maneuvered.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave well in the right order; however, road channels tend to have reasonable flexibility and can be represented by numbers.
Being a better advocate of traffic, association is established between three main characteristics: (1) walking, (2) stress, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps to ensure planning, design, and operation.
