The development of the rapid increase in cornavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January to 15 March 2020
A growing trend in the conditions of cornavirus (COVID-19) shows similar renters in the countries of the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that ensures that, although in different parts of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals, and clinics to care for those in distress should increase the willingness to accept many COVID-19 patients who will need health care, and especially care for those in need.
On 31 December 2019, a group of people with an unknown metatiology was reported in Wunhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new cornavirus that is now called the stocker's number number number corpary cornavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
Since then, illnesses resulting from SARS-CoV-2 have been identified with corronavirus (COVID-19).
The current evidence shows that 80% of COVID-19 people suffer from a non-consolation disorder, which is associated with pneumonia, and most of these people are recovery.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into the most critical illness that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases are faced with an emergency emergency.
Deaths due to COVID 19 are 4%.
In this study, we review the growing COVID-19 events in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the present number of persons with COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID 19 features in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread widely in places and the change in the COVID-19 epidemic worldwide is currently followed by what is taking place in the country.
On 11 March 2020, the General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a plague.
The 5 March of Eusurveillation 2020, Poster et al. reported the first registered COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with WHO definition.
In EU/EA, the first registered people reported by France in 24 January 2020 to the people who returned from Wunhan, Hubei Province, China.
On the 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was found in all 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), which was reported among 39 December 2019 that day, 3968 people were infected and 1,727, this time the 17,750 infected and 1,41 dead were Italian.
Getting an increasing number of cases of COVID 19
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the figures for people with COVID-19 in every country, which are found only by legal resources such as the National Health Center, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are given each day at 8:00 a.m.
This date was used to review the COVID-19 CEA/EEA and the UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the continuing COVID-19 cases, calculates an ongoing development of 14 days of COVID-19, thus considering the natural development of COVID-19, each of the EU/EA and UK, during the January 1 January 15, March 2020 period.
We have also established an increasing number of reported state conditions in 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID 19 countries/EEA and UK
The increased annual events of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK are usually followed by those of the Hubei Province (China).
Throughout the EU/EA and UK, the growing event of COVID-19 began to rise about 21 February and was very cheerful on 28 February 2020 (Reader).
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all the other countries of the EU/EEA and UK indicate the same rising rates of the growing COVID-19 event.
Picture 2 shows an increasing number of cases of COVID-19, in countries of EU/EEA and UK compared with that of Italy at the time of 31 January (20115 March 2020.
Significantly, by 15 March 8:00 a.m., the other 15 countries of the EU/EEA and the UK had already reported the total number compared to that of Italy in the 3 weeks ahead or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases increases rapidly in EU/EA and UK.
The coins marked in an ongoing COVID-19 event indicate that the plague continues at just the same speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries in different regions, different forms of public health care, and likely differing descriptions of conditions in countries as well as various protocols that should be studied to ensure COVID-19, including a follow - up study.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states described the situation when 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19 needed care and the media reported that hospitals and units of emergency care in these regions had reached their peak.
The date of importing COVID-19 into the hospital as well as/or the unit of emergency care is available in the EU/EEA category of 6% and 1% in cases, respectively (not indicated).
It should, however, be organized in order to conform to the current age of caution that focuses on the number of reported situations and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a great difference in the availability of emergency beds as well as in central Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portuguese society.
This means that countries may have more or less helps than Italy (12.5-pounders of emergency care and community care of 100,000 people in 2010–11).
To imitate the conditions associated with the total health care, which provides an average of each EU/EEA and UK in terms of the increase in the hospital was established in connection with the risk of the USOVID-19 hospital because of the risk of crossing the amount of emergency care, is provided in a 6 - to - percent review of the emergency risk of the ECDC in connection with COVID-19.
As conditions abound in some areas in the EU/EA and UK countries, and hospitals and emergency units often help some people in the region, information about conditions and hospital care should be obtained on the level of the NORTS-2).
Italian experiences as well as current international states indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly spreading in EU/EEA and UK.
The countries, hospitals, and units of emergency care should be prepared for the patient’s continuing interaction of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the increase in patients with COV-19 who need medical care, and especially the emergency care, such as that took place in the affected areas in Italy.
As shown in a recent ECDC survey of an emergency, an immediate, enthusiastic, and detailed approach is important to delay the transmission of SARS-COV-2, by making changes from the control control system to a decrease, since the rapid increase in the number of circumstances may not prevent the decision - making workers and hospital's time of understanding, to accept and to adjust their response to the appropriate extent of time.
An examination of an emergency also means public health measures to control the risk of an epidemic.
There is a small gap of opportunity in which the nations can have a chance to control further their efforts to reduce the rising of SARS-CV-2 and reduce stress in health care.
Failure of this, it may be that the stations for treatment in some EU/EEA countries will face a multitude of patients who need care in the future or in the weeks to come.
The outbreak of Cronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a servete respiry syndrome (SARS) cornavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2), is currently killing more than 3000 people and affecting more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, which have succeeded in disaster.
Like its same virus, SARS-Cov, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a critical risk and mortality rate rather than SARS but is more contagious and treating older persons than new ones and more males than women.
As a reaction to the rapidly growing number of published information on the developing disease, this article is trying to provide a time - and - depth review on the subject of a fast - moving research article.
We will discuss the basic factors concerning epidemiology, metamy, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this correction will help us to understand and resolve a potentially dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25,20 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to live in their homes on vacation and in several weeks after that because of the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is very similar to the corronavirus (Cov) that caused the outbreak of the Sevete hypnotory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, it was named SARS-Cov-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 11,20, and a related disease was called CV Disease Disease 19 (COVOV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world and about 50 more throughout the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, by over 40,000 patients who had been discharged from the hospital as well as more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a leading public enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/ww.ncbi.n.nig.gov/pubmad/), in less than 200 months, more than 200 pages were printed for their COVID-19 that included their virus, Epidemology, Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment from the first report on January 7,20, which decided the sequence of virus separated from many patients.
This review tries to speed up the progress of research on a new and progressive subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS with another illness caused by CV, the Middle East respiry syndrome (MERS, the 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the underlying cause of disease as well as other important but important questions.
CoVs generally considered to be nonfatogens on human beings, primarily responsible for 15% of the common cold 4.
In this century, however, we have met nearly twice as many patogenic covos, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov, which caused the epidemic that started in China in 2005 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and that was rapidly spreading in other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of Cov in recorded history.
As shown at Death.1.1.1, foreign sources of pneumonia began to be reported in Wunhan on December 31, 2019 in China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case was reported in Wunhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, a combination of health workers was reported, suggesting that human contact was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wunhan was closed down and all public transportation was established.
On January 24 a study of the first treatment of disease reported that, of the 41 patients with certain conditions, only 21 had an accurate contact with the Wunian food market that was considered the first place of the disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO announced an emergency global health situation.
By the time of the report, the disease has spread throughout China as well as in about 50 countries around the world (Death.2).
As the situation is rapidly changing, the conclusion and danger of the epidemic are not known.
On February 11, 2020, a study of a number of 8,866 centers involving 4,021,21 who had been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 indicated a more recovered picture of the epidemic in the following way (https: /mp.q.com/Ul/Ult-HX_HX_XABHABHABAB
SARS-CoV-2 is sick all year, but mainly 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of patients were over 50 years old, there were fewer than 20, and only 14 cases were less than 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grew by principally Hubei groups and then by again.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the trial.
The average age for harvesting was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from the beginning to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic number of reconstruction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.5555)), and the R0 modified was 2.23-4.82.
The number of persons added rapidly before 23 Jan.20, which was similar to the time of a major transfer before Spring Festival in China.
The deaths of registered patients were 1.4% (95%) CCI: 1.10-1.86%), and the changed death rate for all patients was 3,06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (mans), age (60), and critical pneumonia.
CoVs that are part of the family of large, hidden bacteria contain a single RNA worm.
They can be divided into four parts, namely, alpha, beta, gammama, and delta, that is, alpha CVs and betas are not known to infect people.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope adheres to the input of angiosin-congreting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cells and the hyptial perptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CV and MERS-CV, in turn, and the link of the classroom.
The RNA gene is released from cytoplasm; after a respirator of the virus, RNA of a gene associated with glycoprotein and necacticopic proteins creates hormones containing a hormone, including a plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-Cov-2 was found to be a new form of beara-Cov with 99.98% genetic codes among the 10 successive samples gathered in the first part of the flight, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is usually more like SARS-CV than MERS-CV.
Using microscopy for transmission of electrons, SARS-CV-2 crystals were found in the most clear parts in the epithelium of the airway for humans.
ACE2 people were identified as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov share.
However, the S-SARS-Cov-2 protein includes a person's ACE2 more rapidly than that of the SARS-Cov, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CV-2 causes less risk of infection than SARS-CV.
The SARS-Cov-2 can also form a new temporary protein produced by the orf3b and the output protein produced by theorf8.
The SARS-CV-2orp may play a role in the microgenicity and may affect the appearance of IFNU; however, anorf8 contains no known background or active motif.
On February 18, 2020, the Zhou, etc., reported an ACE2 Cyon-EM building with a full length of 2.9 Å combined with amino acid motor.
It was found that these connections, with open and closed buildings, were combined as dirmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 intercomer is able to combine two S proteins, which provide evidence of coV vision and additions.
B0AT1 may be a treatment factor in drug dealing to suppress SARS-CV-2.
Roots and Centrals
It is known that both the SARS-Cov and the MERS-CV began in the bats and went on to the people with Civet cats and lawyers, respectively.
By comparison of SARS-Cov-2 and other covs, bats are recognized as the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a new virus is equal to 96% and two CORS such as SARVVX45 from the LL-CVZCXCX1 filter and SL-CoVX21 L-CVX1 of Kne.
However, what magnetic field did assist the virus to break down the barrier between animals so that it could infect humans is unknown, and the path of transmission is still to be explained.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be a virus carriers from humans that involved the combination of the same features within the S protein.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - with a long nose, insects that are commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine - may be an organization of SARS-CV-2 based on 99% of genetic factors in the Covins and SAR-CV-2.
However, the difference of 1% that is spread between two genes makes a big difference; hence, the determined results of strong femininity are still waiting (Death.3).
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in large measure are not known at present.
SARS-Cov and MERS-CV can live without a creature up to 48 hours in a dry place and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40% 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar features.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 has no connection with ultraviolet radiation and 50°C temperatures for 30 minutes; Ether, 75% of ethanol, chlorine antibiotic, percetic acid, chloform, and other anti-infloforms, but not chloxide, can make the virus effective.
All too often there is a lack of defenses against SARS-CV-2 and that is why they are at risk of developing a new virus.
At present, no detailed research has been reported on the reactions of antibodies to SARS-CV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous investigations of other coVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CV (Uni.4.4).
Often, after the virus attacks the body, it is first seen by the body’s biological immune system (PRRs) that include receptors such as the type C, a type of receptor such as Toll (TLLR), a specialrator such as NOR (NLRRR), and an areptor like I (RRRRR).
With different channels, the virus causes the symptoms of diarrhea, the production of endaric cells, and the production of interferons of I (IFNs) that speed up the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage pactococytosis of the virus.
However, the N hormone of SARS-CV can help the virus to escape the reaction of the immune system.
Soon, a cooperative immune reaction is joining the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes covering the CD4+ cells and CD8+ play an important role in protecting.
The CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce immune defenses, as well as the CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
T's valuable T cells produce proinflammatory cytokin to help protect cells.
However, CV can prevent T cell function by producing T cells's apoptosis.
Unprescription of churorals, including C3a and C5a and the immune system, is also important in fighting the infection.
For example, body defenses taken from a patient prevents MERS-CV from operating.
On the other hand, over - the - counter reaction of the immune system constitutes a large number of radics in a place that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other body organs, and, in the worst of all, the failure of many body organs and even deaths.
SARS-CV-2, having the first feature as a group, has many opportunities for getting sick with older people who suffer from prenatal illness as well as women who are pregnant.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a large number of microbes or who have immune reactions to the presence of immune systems, to be more likely to be involved than others.
The range of the cause of the SARS-CV-2 period is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 people in Wunhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 people shows that the planting period was 3 days in average and had an average of 0 to 24 days.
Recent studies, as described above, have shown that the harvesting period was 4.8 days (.3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 persons.
It is particularly important for health authorities to change the time of shutters based on the right period of cultivation, by means of which people are prevented from infecting people who have no symptoms of transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed, or infected, need to be locked up for 14 days.
Should the curfew be extended 24 days?
The fever is usually the first and first sign of COVID-19, which may not be associated with symptoms or other symptoms such as non-inflammatory coughs, loss of breath, muscle pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, cancer, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia in one unit after the outbreak of the disease.
In critical situations, patients quickly improved with chronic respiratory infections, sprock, metabolic acid acid, and coloopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as a critical fever, even if there are no unusual features seen in the photo of the lungs, should be screened for first diagnosis.
A study of human information done at the end of December 2008 showed that 98% of the symptoms of fever, 76% of non-infraction, 55% of dyspnea, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed breathing with the aid of a machine.
Similar findings were reported on in two recent studies of family planning as well as a collection that comes from contact with a person who does not have symptoms.
In comparison, a study of human knowledge in 2012 indicated that MERS-Cov patients also had fever (998%), a mild cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their primary symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed breathing with the aid of a machine, much more than the patients with COVID-19 and which are in harmony with the highest rate of MERS killing than COVID-19.
Diarrheic disease (26%) and voice pain (21%) were also noted for MERS patients.
In the SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99.100%), non-cancerance (9%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and painy throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing was needed in about 14% 20% of patients.
On February 14, the death due to COVID-19 was 2% when informed patients reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by the SARS in November 2002 were 10 percent of all the 8,096 patients confirmed.
In MERS, based on human knowledge research in June 2012, death was 37% of the 2,494 patients registered.
The first study reported that the R0 of SAS-CoV-2 had a 6.47 (CI) degree of self-depend (95%) was 5,71-7.23, when R0 of SARS-CV had a range of from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with MERS-CV and SARA-CV regarding their symptoms, death, and R0 are represented as Table Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher capacity to expand than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, but it has little power to kill.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-Cov and SARS-CV.
The start of a chain reaction usually takes place in the same family or at a similar gathering or as a passenger boat.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or staying in the Wunhan or other affected areas or contacting people who are involved or patients in two recent weeks.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for a longer time than two weeks and that patients who have been treated out of the hospital can still carry the virus again, giving the warning to increase the time of closing.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the original stages.
For example, Lymphopenia has a number of white blood cells < 4×109/L that includes the number of lymphocyte count < 1x109/L, along with the highest levels of assparate amnonsphere and viremia are found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes of liver and blood along with erythroylobin were high in the blood of other patients, and C-rective protein and erythroyte forment was high in the blood of most patients.
For patients with a serious illness, D-dir, the production of fibrin in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte number had dropped dramatically.
It was discovered in the heart of many patients with COVID-19 and with double - degree or gray glacial parasity in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from abnormal pneumonias, severe lung damage, and actate back pain syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled diarrhea, the development of fluids, and progressive fibrosis puts the gas in danger.
The I-I-I-I-type of pneumocyte reduces the level of surfactant and increases the stress of the upper area, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs and increases the risk of falling of the lungs.
Therefore, the worst effects of radiography are often similar to the most critical condition of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first postthological analysis of COVID-19 showed the outbreak of pneummyytes, the formation of hyal membranes, and the development of intertitial lymphocytes, as well as that of the patients in the MSARS and MERS patients.
The diagnosis of the SARS-CV-2 is using the aid-transpriptase postalization (RT-PR) used as a major subject for COVID-19 testing.
However, because of the high number of non-smokers, which may speed up the epidemic, medical evidence began to be used when surgery (not only for RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose when the SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, the combination of the history of disease, treatment, laboratory tests, and irradiological results are essential and vital for effective testing.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described the SHERLOCK protocol based on the CSRS-CV-2, which receives the non-covable RNA bits of RNA in 20 × 10-18/L to 200 × 10-18/20 per-mul/100 versions (100 copies of each loader) being used as a little during the time without our need.
It is hoped that a new approach will greatly improve empathy and benefit if it is confirmed in medical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with new CoV, doctors can primarily provide support for COV-19 patients, while trying different forms of medical treatment used or previously promoted to treat some Cov such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV and MERS-CV and other infectious diseases (Helb).).
These treatments include current therapy and may be antiviral drugs, immunupressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicines, and mental aid.
It is even proposed to use plasma for patients as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical firms compete to develop immune defenses and goals against infection.
SARS-Cov-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and is likely to attack, on a small scale, some of the body organs that show ACE2, such as breastintintics and kidneys.
Nevertheless, poor work and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to improving symptoms and saving health and includes general health care, higher air flow, air exposure, and air - conditioning use of biodegradable devices.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on extracrorporal membrane perigenation (ECMO), a modified method of cardiopulmonary surgery used to treat heart failure or life - threatening breathing failure.
In addition, keeping in the form of electronic etrolyte, preventing and treating second additions as well as sprock, as well as the protection of vital body parts are also important for patients with SARS-CV-2.
It is known that cytokin storm is the result of the excessive response of antibodies to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokin storm is the reaction of the cytokin system with features of the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF Frederick, IL-2, IL-6, IFN sustenanceer, FNN, FNP1, and MCP1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to free a large number of free radar that are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of many body organs.
The pressure of the immune system is crucial to treatment of cytokin storms, especially for the most sensitive patients.
The corticosteroids and tolizumabs, anti-IL6 monoc all, have been used to treat cytokin storm.
Other physical therapy of cytokin storm involves the control of the immune system directed to the T cells; the prevention of IFN-UDING, IL1, and TNF; the loss of JakK; the Jannatumob; the cytokin mill; and HDAC agents.
Prosteroids, such as immunopressants, are widely used for the treatment of SARS to reduce the risk of diarrhea.
However, the steroids on a higher scale have not benefited from the critical damage to SARS patients and COVID-19 patients.
Rather, it may cause unpleasant side effects, especially Avascular osteonerosis, which interferes with prognosis in a significant way.
Nevertheless, a brief series of corticosteroids in low - middle levels has been recommended to be used carefully for COVID-19 patients who are seriously ill.
At the time of writing, no effective antibacterial treatment had been established.
However, cremdesivir, which is the Nucleotide with a log, was found to work on an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antibiotic that was first developed by Gilead to treat the diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also indicated that it could prevent RNA bacteria with one of the MERS virus and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has given China the building to conduct research on people with SARS-CV-2, and the results are considered red.
In addition, briitinb, interferon- approached, lepinavir/ritonavir, and Arbanin have been elevated as possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrheic disease, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after treatment combined with trinavir/ritonavir.
The connection between these and other medications used in treating patients should be taken seriously.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and developed immune systems
The collecting of blood for patients who survive a contagious disease in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect the healthy from infection is much longer than a long history.
In fact, healthy patients tend to have a higher degree of immune system resistance to their immune system.
The immune system is a magmulobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other unnecessary substances in the body and can identify different cells in the disease and prevent them from operating directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected into the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and were confined to 10 patients in a critical manner.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced diarrheas as well as infection levels and improved oxygen levels in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed in order to promote a widely used method before a treatment is developed.
In addition, in view of the results of medical treatment, some of the side effects associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, immune systems can unduly promote immune reactions and cause cytokinic illness, which may be life - threatening.
The body’s number of antibodies is usually low, and the need for plasma is greater that it can be treated for patients who are seriously ill.
It is very difficult to develop and produce certain immune systems too quickly to combat a global epidemic.
In view of this, it is most important and reasonable to distinguish the B cells of patients who are normal and recognize the genetic codes that have a function or are removed from the body’s immune system in order to represent the vital proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various forms of disease in China for thousands of years.
Its effects, however, depend greatly on the combination of many different parts of the form of a disease test based on the TCM vision.
Most active parts remain anonymous or vague as it is hard to pick up and confirm such parts or their effective combinations.
In the meantime, because of the lack of effective and precise COVID-19 treatment, the TCM has turned into one of the major treatments for patients with small symptoms have been among those who have recovered in critical stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen's pills were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates for treatment for patients with COVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningú (50%), and Hinan (50%), while the state of Hubei, which used the TCM, which used 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had a lower rate of recovery (13%).
This is an incorrect comparison, however, as other factors such as the number and severity of patients should be put into review.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published research on the comparison of West medicine (WM) alone and the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the times required for body temperature to improve, the loss of symptoms, and hospitalization were shorter in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group.
Interestingly, the negative rate of symptoms (from minors) was dramatically low in the WM+TCM group only (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and death was much lower in the WM+TCM group than only 8.8% compared to 39%.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for well - conducted research at large levels and institutions.
It may also be interesting that the course of action has been marked and made clear that the active aspects of TCM treatment or combinations if possible.
Patients who are suspected of being diagnosed with COVID-19 are often more likely to fear a highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who are locked up again are lonely, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxicia, and diarrhea as well as serious side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental depression.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, many mental disorders involving chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mood disorders, mood swings, mental disorders, and even suicides were reported.
A forced and closed line of communication, such as part of public health response to the collapse of COVID-19, may cause many people to feel anxious and guilty about the consequences of joining, closing, and closing up with family and friends.
As a result, mental care should be given to COVID-19 patients, persons suspected of having, contact with them and the general community in need.
Mental help should include the development of mental health resources in many fields, clear communication with regular and accurate references to SARS-CV-2 and medical programs as well as the use of electronic aids and programs to avoid close association with others.
Practical goals are essential to break up the chain of intersecting from animals and people attached to strangers who may be exposed and often cooperate with antibacterial therapies in the treatment of new microbes.
Efforts have been made to develop goals based on S proteins to develop long - term and lifesaving immunity as well as/or to prevent access to SARS-CV.
Limited goals have been studied with animals in regard to the SARS.
However, the biological functions of these species are intended for adults as well as death - defying models and their protection against the infection from animals to humans before medical research is started.
This is because the SARS has ceased 17 years ago and no new illness has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the rare conditions and the MERS collections continue to come from the Middle East and spread to other regions because of the continued resistance of biological sources from animals to humans in infected areas.
Embalming devices have been developed by MERS by the use of an unused virus, plasma in DNA, viral infections, nonparticles, microorganisms, and lower units in the immune system and some have been tested in animal models.
The construction of a safe and effective goal against SARS-CV-2 in persons connected is an urgent and important task in controlling the continuing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to withstand difficulties because of the long period (an average of 18 months) that is needed to develop the goal and the changing types of CVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its medical program full of thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients can recover slowly without the effects of previous disease.
However, according to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also linked to a higher level of sickness and death in patients with serious illness.
Therefore, building a model for the cause of the disease is essential to health - care providers in order to establish its stamps, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on medical research reported until now, the following factors may be affected or linked to the cause of COVID- 19 (Cableable) patients:
Old: Old age was the most important factor in the causes of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID 19 came mainly from the age of 30-65 and 47% of those patients were more than 50 in a study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who needed attention to the critical conditions had a higher chance of being treated with other diseases and disorders and were more advanced than those who did not have (66 age than 56), which suggests that age is a factor contributing to the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already existing and complex diseases: COVID-19 patients who need emergency care have a higher chance of handling serious heart damage as well as arthrythmia.
Heart - to - heart events were also the main cause of deaths for the SalRS patients.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of sticking to ACE2-posive constituencytes, which may lead to adverse liver damage to COVID-19 patients.
It is good to note that both age and present illness are related to strictness and may interfere with one another.
The effects of a rare laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicate the risk of swelling or muscle damage and have been raised as a potential factor in disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
There is also a connection between the CRP level and the risk and the cause of COVID-19.
In addition, high Alterate dehydrogenese (LDH), asparate amnonsfrase (AST), alanine aminosphere (ALT), and creatine kinasse (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common symptoms of heart failure or courage.
Major medical symptoms: chest radiation and temporary progression of the symptoms of treatment should be considered along with the other problems of predicting the effects and disorders of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, immunupressants are often used as an alternative therapy to reduce the risk of diarrhea.
As widely used for the high number of corticosteroids to patients with serious SARS, most of the survivors who were affected by Avascular osteocrosis have a lifetime disability and a poor quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, thesteroids should be used at least and a short time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered severe depression as they had to endure long periods of silence and great uncertainty and see the death of close family members as well as their fellow patients.
It is essential that mental and emotional counseling has been provided for long - term support to help patients recover from depression and return to normal health.
In accordance with the study of human knowledge so far, COVID-19 appears to have aspects of epidemiological differences different from SARS.
In addition to repeated breathing effort below, the SARS-CV-2 can easily repeat the above breathing process and cause little or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, as are the CVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients who are involved in the first stage or the age of irrigation can produce a large number of infections during daily activities, which create a greater difficulty in the control of the epidemic.
However, the addition of SARS-Cov was thought to occur when patients were very sick, while most of the additions did not occur in the first stage.
As a result, COVID 19 outbreaks are more critical and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are many current efforts in China that include the closing of the Wunhan and surrounding cities and the continuing closing of the population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CV-2.
Although these measures have greatly damaged the economy and other areas of the world, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a decrease in the pace of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the flight will end in March and the reduction rate will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some experts do not have that hope.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which seems more related to the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Lungeni, et al., developed a plan to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CV-2 may carry two thirds of the world’s population.
The Canadian team reported that the SARS-CoV-2 was found in both of the mid-turbinate tubes and of patients who had recovered and had come out of the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may be a respirator.
However, promising signs appear in China on the decline in the number of sick young people, indicating that current strategies may be effective.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would hold one million people and that half a million people would die.
However, because of strong restraints and strong isolations, the disease has to be controlled.
It may be possible, like SARS-Cov, that SARS-CoV-2 may be weak and may eventually end up or become a very sick virus capable of human contact.
The comparison of COVID-19 with that of the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Demal.55).
SARS-CV-2 closely relates to coughing or yawning, and it may be by direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was rediscovered in the stomach, which provides a new opportunity to be transmitted from the abdomen to the mouth.
A recent survey of 138 patients reported that 41% of patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously had other diseases as well as 40 health - care workers.
As a result, greater caution should be exercised to protect individuals, especially health - care professionals, family members, peers, even those who are close to patients or close friends.
The first line of protection that may be used to reduce the risk of wearing masks; both the use of surgical masks and the use of the N95 respitor (division # 1860s) helps control the spread of germs.
The facial masks prevent fluids from coming from a person who may have been exposed to air and cling to the face of things, where it can be passed on to other people.
However, the N95 takaskis (list # 1860s) can only protect you from breathing 10 to 80 mms, while only 5% of zeros can completely pass; SARS-CV-2 has the same size as SARS-CV is both about 85 nm.
Since the crystals can pass through the five surgicals combined, the medical surgeons working directly with patients must wear navigations of N95 (dividual # 1860s) and not surgical discs.
In addition to the masks, health - care surgeons should wear well - balanced protective masks to reduce the risk of infection.
Germs can pass through human eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was introduced with SARS-CoV-2 although she was wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered her body by taking in her eyes and becoming rebellious.
As a result, health - care professionals should also wear facial protective masks that cannot show or mirrors while working with patients.
In the general community in areas affected or may be affected, it is recommended that everyone wash his hands with a soap more often than usual, try to stay in the house to close and keep in touch with people who may be exposed to them.
A three - degree period is considered the ideal limit for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of infection.
Although SARS-Cov-2 came as a new virus in the world, its existence and the same building as the SARS-Cov as reported on January 7, 2020 was to be a warning in China because it still remembered the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan convinces residents that the new virus has a minor infection and has a minor retrieval effect when it comes from one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message makes the public aware, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and they were missed the critical time to control the virus before it was hit in Wunhan.
The geese to control Chinese disease may learn from this crucial lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these geners should be more accurate in making public declarations as each name is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the unusual knowledge from a clinic than to wait for informed reports from doctors or officials; (3) have more protection from the possible epidemic during its first phase than they try to comfort the public; and (4) do more to improve public awareness of infectious diseases and investigations and respond at certain times.
The COVID 19 outbreak due to a new SARS-CV-2 infection at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China as well as about 50 other countries around the world during the writing.
Since the virus closely resembles SARS-Cov and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 created the feeling that SARS is repeated.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential to control the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID 19 affects more people who are older than young men and men more than women, and the risk of death is higher than that of older people than younger.
The SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID 19 (10.91%) compared with 1.4%.
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they don't have symptoms, while SARS patients transmit it when they are very ill, causing a greater problem in controlling COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is more rapid and widespread than SARS-CV.
A regular evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 may be extremely severe for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may also be more prone to infections during tests of the virus.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Since there is an immediate priority in COVID-19 research, there are a few critical problems that need to be solved, including:
Where does the SARS-CoV-2 appear?
Although they found that there are 96% of the genetic structure between the SARS-CV-2 and two covos like SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is emerging from infants.
What animal was in the center that transmitted the virus from the first beetle, let alone the bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers to #1 and 2, we can't effectively cut through, and flying may become worse at any time.
Although the molecular models of cell chemistry have shown that SARS-CoV-2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the cells of the respiratory system and create changes that cause the resulting illness?
Is the virus also attached to the cells that show ACE2 in some parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach a quick and accurate assessment as well as effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of the virus change during human contact?
Will it be a global epidemic, or will it end like the SARS or will it occasionally become worse like a cold?
It is important, but it may take some time to consider the answers to the questions raised above as well as many other questions.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our health to normal conditions.
The roots of a virus from animals go to people of the cronavirus
The change and consistency have promoted coronavirusco (Coves) and their organization, which includes humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two Covs (HCOVs) were known to be the cause of a minor disease, such as common flu.
The outbreak of the virus has been called a posteroperry syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiration syndrome (MERS) has changed the situation to show how much damage HCOV can cause and threaten life.
The appearance of the SARS-Cov-2 in China in the mid - 2019 was reputating the CoVs in the exhibition and amazed us with a higher likelihood but with less respect to her sister SARS-Cov.
HCOV is a zonosis, and understanding the origin of HCV zone can help us.
Most HCVs appear in bats and do not cause infection in them.
The middle-menities of other HCVs are also known.
Predatoring has positive effects on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the interaction of the CV animal organization may reveal an important understanding of the structure of the CV in humans.
In this review, he introduces the confusion of already existing knowledge regarding the seven HCVs, and we will focus on the history of its discovery and the origin of the ozone layer and the intercomment of various creatures.
More important, it compares and divides different HCOVs in the view of the change of the virus and the combination of genes.
The current CV epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful evolutionary change and the effects of the virus to the risk of disease are also highlighted.
The Coronavirus (Covs) are part of the Coronnabinidae family, which is made up of a closed, nerve - fibrosis, which contains a single RNA.
These bacteria contain the largest of 26 to 32 kilobarses among RNA bacteria called "CVs" because of their microchips that form the shade below the electron microscope.
According to the building, the Covs with non-genomes may be equally organized.
About three parts of the genome consists of two large reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated to bepplyplyte polyteins andpp1abs.
The polyproteins are further tested to build 16 additional proteins without building, called unsp1 ~/16.
The remaining part of the Genome contains OrF proteins for the building, including Spike (S), a telescope (E), mommbrane (M), and Nucleoproin (N).
The number of proteins related to the list also has a code of various CV rows.
Based on the variations of proteins, CVs are divided into four categories (alpha-Cov, beta-CV, gamma-CV and Alt-CV), where the latter region contains most HCVs and is divided into four categories (A, B, C, and D).
Pylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rats are a source of alpha-CV and beta-CV genes, while birds are the source of the Covs and Delta-CVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have progressively crossed the boundaries of creatures, and most of them have become important to humans.
To date, seven Covs (HCovs) were known.
Among these HCO-29E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CV.
The other five-CoV-CoV included HC43, HCV-HKU1, serre the number of pyramid functions corrotory cornavirus (SARS-CV), Middle East-Spipiry syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-CV-2.
HCV-29E, HCV-O43, HCV-HKUMI1 and HCV-NL63 often cause minor symptoms, such as common flu and/or diarrhea.
The SARS-Cov, MERS-CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, causes serious respiratory respiratory infections in so many patients that make up a higher likelihood of the development of the accastory syndrome (ARDS) and other diseases occurring outside the lungs.
The first form of HCV-29E, B814, was separated from normal cold patients in the mid - 1960 ’ s.
Since then, further knowledge has been made of the numerous research projects of HCV-29E and HC43, both of which cause immediate symptoms.
In fact, the idea was adopted that dealing with HCOVs was usually harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The outbreak of the SARS in 2003 is one of the most tragic events in modern history, affecting more than 8,000 people and had an average death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiration syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that may occasionally occur in some parts of the world.
The new HCOV of 2019 (NCOV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the leading cause of the 2019 CV [COVID-19] epidemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected over 91,000 persons on March 3, 2020.
Aram has been crying and the earth should be ready for the coming SARS-Cov-2 epidemic.
All seven HCOVs have the origin of zootic from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Much evidence supports the origin of all HCVs converting from bats, where bacteria are well suited and do not cause disease but indicate a vast array of genetic diversity.
The CVOD 19 epidemic has presented major medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges in China and the world.
Following the roots of the HCV zone provides a framework of understanding the natural history, the motivation force, and the senses of motion.
This can also guide or help to determine the cause, the middle and the development of the SARS-CV-2 animal (cov-2) photo, which will have significant side effects on future transmission.
In this review the introduction introduced a combination of the origin of the ozone layer, the combination of different creatures and HCV's satellites.
In particular, we highlight and talk about the same team that bacteria are the parent of HCV often do not cause illness in their natural environment but cause sickness after contact with different creatures and new technology.
It also restores the dial of HCOV when the increase in contact usually reaches and decreases the methotgenicity.
The effects of continued SARS-CoV-2 movement are discussed again in this context.
Animal Covs have been known since the end of the 1930 ’ s.
Before the first division of the HCV-29E type B814 from what came out of the patients ’ teeth of normal cold cold, various CVs were separated from the various types of animals, including gloves, rats, cattle, pigs, cats, cats, and dogs.
In the last decades, seven HCOVs have been found.
A brief summary of the history of HCV detection in its sequence (Cable 1) may benefit and teach.
The first form of HCV-29E was separated from the respiratory system of patients with higher respiratory infections in the year 1965, and was adopted to develop into the lungs of WI-38.
HCOV-29E patients had normal flu symptoms, including headaches, nausea, and sore throats, and fever and seizures were seen in 10,020% cases.
Later, in 1967, HC43 separated the nervous system and the process of the next series in the brain of nursing rats.
The medical aspects of HC43 are seen to be similar to those caused by HCV-29E, which were not divided according to symptoms in the combination of other respiratory infections such as hepatitis A and bronovirus.
Both HCV-29E and HC43 have spread around the globe, and it is often linked during the winter season to good weather.
Usually, the time for these two bacteria is less than one week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people suffering from HCV-29E experience a mild cold.
Only a few patients with depressed immune systems showed that they had a serious respiratory disease below.
SARS, also known as "a rare pneumonia", became the first pandemic caused by HCOV in human history and is a component of SARS-CV, third HCV discovered.
The first outbreak of SARS can be traced to the end of 2002 at China’s Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 patients and 774 dead, spread in many countries and continents.
Without the larger sharks, it was estimated that each event could cause at least two other cases, during the feeding period of 4 to 7 days, and the rise of the infection was due to the 10th day of the illness.
The patients involved with SARS-CV initially seemed to suffer from asthma, headaches, fever, malaria, and fever, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Mymphopenia, a study of abnormal liver function, as well as high creatine ikene, is among the rare ones of the normal battery due to SARS.
The spread of alvelar damage, the explosion of epithelial cell cell and the growth of macrophage have been observed in SARS patients.
Almost 20-30% of patients need emergency care and air - conditioning.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many of the body’s parts that involve the immune system, the liver and the kidneys, can also be absorbed into these critical conditions, often accompanied by cytokin storm, which may kill especially among the immune patients.
The virus was first separated from the open lung surgery of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made in connection with HCV research.
HCov-NL63 was separated from a 7 - month - old Dutch child in late 2004.
It was first found that it had grown up with small children, elderly people, and immune patients who had been exposed to respiratory infections.
The discovery of corryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in HCV-NL63 cases.
One independent study described the distillation of the same virus from the nucleus of an eight - month - old male who suffers from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Though it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is in fact spreading throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its higher risk occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obrructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71 - year - old male who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the hormones available in the community as well as bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 was reported to be related to a specific asthmatic factorage.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCV-29E and HC43, HCW-HKI1 was found worldwide, causing minor respiratory infections.
All these HCOVs that are found in the community are well - adjusted and often have little chance of converting to being sorely paratogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the rare form of HCV-NL63 of extremely lethal type, reportedly responsible for low respiratory activity in China.
Often, when these HCOVs gain the ability to absorb easily and maintain themselves further within the population, they also kill or become parthogenic.
MERS-Cov was first separated in 2012 from a 60 - year - old patient who suffered severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the conditions confirmed by the bottle is from the Middle East, circumstances are spreading to nearby contacts that are reported in various countries of Europe and Tunisia.
Another second outbreak took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 guarantees.
The appearance of MERS treatment is similar to that of the SARS, which is marked by a growing critical hormone.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered serious kidney failure, which is currently different from MERS among HCV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gestrointintic symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed incidents with high mortality rates have been reported, making MERS-CV one of the most dangerous microbes of mankind.
From mid - December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as SARS-CoV-2 were found in Wunhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of a low respiratory disease caused by SARS-CV-2 as the Emergency Public Health Fund which should trouble the World and called COVID-19.
On March 3,20, it was reported that 90,053 people were registered around the world, with 3.4% death rate.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the other outside is 1.2%.
SARS-Cov-2 causes serious respiratory infections such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV, which have been introduced as fever, coughing, and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most critical symptoms and can quickly develop into a caspisterary syndrome.
Although the SARS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 are almost the same for the same development of the high nucleotide sequence of 82%, there are different groups in the branches of the pylogenetic tree.
SARS-Cov-2 appears to be a part of thethogenic but more closely related to SARS-Cov and MERS-CV.
It is reported that there are people who have no symptoms with SARS-CV-2 and may be involved in its rapid spread worldwide.
Contrasting and dividing SARS-Cov-2 with six other HCOVs produces a much more interesting contrast.
First of all, the feeding period and the length of the continued HCV is much the same.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal rent of six other HCVs.
Second, the risk of COVID 19 is between SARS-CV and four HCOVs identified in the community (that is HCV-229E, HC43, HV-HKUM1 and HCOLI3).
The SARS-CoV-2 disease, on the other hand, shows the common symptoms during the intervention of the HCOVs in the community, which includes the absence of clear symptoms, minor symptoms or lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, a lower subset of COVID-19's critical conditions can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CV, though the average is less.
Third, the interaction of SARS-Cov-2 also shows interesting lines with both HCOVs and SARS-CV features.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of the HCVs received in the community.
On the other hand, it will be determined whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced to people as in the case of SARS-Cov and MERS-CV.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in samples in the wild.
Whether oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CV under certain circumstances is yet to be explained by future studies.
It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show the appearance of certain seasons of the year as is the case with the HCVs available in the community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-Cov-2 that include its addition, thethogenicity and the recovery saved after passing on to people will affect the final conclusion of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All the HCOVs found in the community cause minor symptoms to be adjusted.
According to one view, it may also be true that people are better compatible with these four HCVs.
In other words, both likely survived the ancient HCOV catastrophe.
HCVs are causing serious diseases for humans, and people who suffer from HCV are no longer there.
To this end, HCOVs should be repeated to people to a reasonable degree in order to allow for the development of changes that conform to the conditions that conflict with the aspects of the sterility.
In this way, if the SARS-CoV-2 explosion continues and is contributing to more people, there will be a greater chance that it will be more compatible with people.
If they do, it may be difficult to prevent them by shutting down or by other means to control the flow.
Over the years, the four CoVs have been found in the community around human society, causing a common cold among people who have the right response to the immune system.
These bacteria do not need a source of animal life.
On the contrary, the SARS-Cov and MERS-COV in the main part of the cathogenic environment are not well compatible with the people and their interconnection between peoples cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in a state and grow up in their ozone source and look for an opportunity to pass on to the victims who can be exposed, either through a middle - or more middle - class organization and to be raised by nonconformists.
SARS-Cov-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-COV and four HCVs identified in the community.
It is very common as HCOV is found in the community, at least for the first creation.
However, the cathogenics are much more than HCOVs obtained in the community and has a small cathogenic factor in SARS-CV or MERS-CV.
It will still be seen whether it will completely conform to humans and surround it without a source or an inner reptile.
Before discussing the origins of HCOV animals, it will help us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of changeists, natural, source, middle - class HCVs.
An animal becomes an HCOV revolution if it lays on a close relative link to which it was associated with a high omology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
Oxygen is usually well - suited and does not cause infection in the virus.
Similarly, the source guide holds the HCV continually and for a long time.
In both cases, aliens are naturally introduced and are natural HCV users or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCV is reintroducted to the central or public relations, it is not well suited to the new system and often causes illness.
This middle mystery may be the ozone source of human contact and play a role in the development of the virus that allows the virus to multiply temporarily and be passed on to humans to develop the level of human contact.
HCV can face the final extension if it is unable to maintain its grip within the central gravity.
On the contrary, HCOVs are able to adapt to the central environment and develop long - term stress.
In this case, middle - class society becomes a natural phenomenon.
An epidemiological chart showed that in the latter looked that a patient who is an example of the SARS had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The following tests of serovalence indicated that animal merchants have an IgG opposite SARS-Cov in comparison with the number of ordinary people.
The masked parm chivet (papa lardata) and the racoon dog in animal markets were found to carry germs such as SARS-CV that are almost the same as SARS-CV.
This was wrongly supported by the fact that no more SARS was reported after all the market cuts were killed.
It has been reported, however, that wild maskeds lalvets or the uncultivated farms in the markets of the living animals were very loose when it comes to the SARS-Cov, suggesting that the masked palm palmvets may be an environment of the interior but not a natural source of SARS-CV.
It is noteworthy, that 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have immune systems against SARS-Cov, we cannot deny the possibility that most mammals are the raisers of SARS-CV.
All of these appear to be the last SARS-Cov operators.
A subsequent study of the SARS-CV host developed a closely associated CoV with the fly, called the SARS-rated Renoflophis bat CoV HKO3 (SARSRS-R-R-R-Bav HKOL3), found on the Chinese horse's shoe.
These needles are very sensitive when it comes to the immune system against SARS-Cov and the sequence of SARS-Rh-BATCH3.
This and other cross-Conversation Covs that correspond to 88-92% of the metacontactic sequences of the gladeous and SARS-CV.
These studies have led to the development of the new idea that the bats can feed new ones of the people.
Covs such as SARS (SL-CVs) are marked on bats, but none except those called WWV1 can be classified as a living virus.
Angiotsin concentrate 2 (ACE2) people are known as SARS-CV host.
WWV1 taken from an example of bats was shown to use bats, Civet and ACE2 people as host to the cell.
Interestingly, SARS patients were able to kill WEV1.
So far, WIV1 represents a close link of SARS-Cov to bats, which has shared in 95% of the  spirit of the nucleotide sequence.
Although there is a higher hormone between these two organisms, WEV1 is generally believed to be not the nearest parent virus of SARS-CV and the bats were the nearest SARS-CV virus.
Pylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CV with the same group as the CoV-HKU4 beetle and CoV-HKOL5 mosquito.
CoV-HKO4 of bats and MERS-CV use the same organizational assignment, diaptill perptidase 4 (DP4), on the path of the virus.
The sequence of the RNA polymerase based on the MERS-CV RNA is closely related to thephylogenetically by its native beta-Covtacts discovered in Europe and Africa.
So far, no active MERS-Cov can be found in wild bats.
MERS-Cov along with its close relative CoV-HKOL 25 users shared only in 87% of the metamorphic sequence.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest source of MERS-CV.
On the other hand, surveys in the Middle East have shown that hydrogen camels are seroposives in the body that kill MERS-CV directly, like camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
MERS-Cov, a living virus found among humans, was separated from the navel tube of the hydrogen camel, which further showed that camels are a real source of MERS-CV.
It is also noteworthy that small symptoms were often seen but a significant release of the virus from the camel that was added to the MERS-CV by research.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels not only removed the bacteria with the respiratory system but also developed the mouth’s digestive system, which is also the primary channel for the removal of the virus from the bats.
However, since most MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it may be that contact from one person to unknown channels involving unknown animals in the MERS-CV.
The SARS-Cov-2 shared with 96.2% of the Nuclear hormone and CoVRTG13 of the nuts separated from Rhinolosffifis.
As is true of SARS-Cov and MERS-CV, the variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large for parental association.
That means, the bats may have been the nearest source of SARS-CoV-2 unless there is a chance of finding nearly equal codivis in the future.
It is suggested that the non-ARS-CV-2 non-coving animals should be among the animals sold and killed in the Huanan Seafod Wolelise Market, most of which were associated with the first COVID-19 disease, which indicates that there may have been an occasion of interimation between animals and humans.
A few recent studies based on the megathenomic sequence have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangoliins (Manis javanica) may have retained older beta-Covs related to SARS-Cov-2.
These are the new congenial Covs corresponding in 85-92% of the met metamorphosis sequences of Nuclear and SARS-CV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 by about 90% in the sequence of Nucleotide.
They come together into two subdivisions of a virus almost equal to SARS-CoV-2 on a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares the background of the relatively equal territory (RBD) and SARS-CV-2, and the equivalent of a series of 97.4% of amino acid.
In sharp contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of metomology.
A previous study of sick spinalins reported the discovery of infected contraceptives in lung samples, which appear to be similar to SARS-CV-2.
The study used various construction methods and manual planning to create a sequence of a genome composed of about 86.3% of the full length of the virus virus.
We cannot set aside the pangolin as one of the near strangers of SARS-Cov-2.
In the meantime, however, there is no evidence that the pangoli is a direct source of SARS-CoV-2 because of the variations of the sequence between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-CV-2 of pongolilin related to beta-CV.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is further shorter between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 of the province related to beta-CV.
The SARS-CoV-2 conversion effort on bats, pongolins and other mammals is yet to be found.
Although higher order met with RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, SARS-Cov-2 related to beta-Cov, SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 shared a higher omlogic sequence.
There are higher concerns that the highest degree of equality between SARS-CoV-2 condomin connection with beta-Cov and SARS-CV-2 is accompanied by the change in connection with selection.
One promotion recommends the reconciliation between the SARS-CoV-2 of the province associated with beta-Cov and RaTG13 on the third wild animal.
As a force for converting, reuniting is widespread among beta-CVs.
The conclusion was not yet reached with regard to the origin of the nearby SARS-Cov-2.
In addition to highly-pathogenic HCV-29E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCULI1's origin is also checked.
Phygenetic evidence has shown that both HCOV-NL63 and HCoV-299E may have been started in the vitroxic Cov-OC43 bacteria and HCWI1 bacteria found in rats.
It is reported that ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge Cov) obtained from the three - color North American coffee plant indicated a relationship close to HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-29E was related to the genes and other Comotone Copposaderos/Ganakam/19/2028, which was discovered in Ghana, while Cammelads had been accused of being their nearest organization.
To explain, current knowledge about the origin of known HCV animals is summed up in Photo 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of physics has provided evidence of the combination of HCV creatures in history.
When HC43 was transferred from one animal to the other to humans from pets in about 1890, the epidemic of respiratory disease was recorded.
The history of the interrelation of HCV-29E is not very clear.
Integrational albatross associated with HCV-29E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CV.
A few evidences support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, people not alpacas may be connected to bats in the same environment.
Instead, people are close to alpacas.
Second, the alpha-CoVs associated with HCV-29E are different and do not cause illness on bats, while alpaca's alcasa albatross caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in the animals that are exposed to it.
Finally, alpaca alfalca alvi has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we will not ignore the possibility that alpacas get alpha-Cov related HCV-29E to people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of germs that cause human diseases that include a rabbinic virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may transmit HCV-29E directly to people.
On the other hand, when the alpha-Covian albatross serve as a collection of HCV-29E genes, the alcas and the hydrogen camels may be the central channel that transmits the virus to people, as is the MERS-CV.
MERS-Cov is a good example of interracial interaction from the bats to the camel to humans.
The origin of the MERS-Cov evolution from bats is known in its first review and strengthened by the following discovery.
Clearly, the bats provide an opportunity for the exchange of genes between different animals and different kinds of animals.
Long health, crowded colonies, close community ties and the ability to fly all are ideal conditions for bats to be a good ‘ microbe. ’
On the other hand, the MERS-CV has been introduced to the camel in the hydrogen.
It is well - suited to these camels that they turn into a central organization that is a stable and natural source.
MERS-Cov causes fewer illnesses and has lower levels of change in the animals.
Its access to humans is a mistake and people remain the last MERS-CV organization since its transmission can be saved.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-Cov transfer, the role of the pogolins, if available, in the transmission of SARS-CV-2 is different.
In particular, pongolin beta-Covs causes serious problems for the posonglins.
He may be the final entity of the three-Covs related to SARS-CoV-2, such as Civers in the form of SARS-CV.
A few chances of intercomment with SARS-CV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First of all, bats may be the host of a virus associated with SARS-Cov-2 that is almost equal to SARS-CV-2.
Humans may play a role similar to that of bats by performing animal surgery or coal mining.
Second, the pangolins may be a highly developed environment in which the virus related to SARS-CV-2 has recently been developed.
People are infected by injecting and eating slaughtered meat.
It is possible that many mammals including pets may be exposed to SARS-CV-2.
An examination of the immune system of pets and the wild animals is required.
The third, as mentioned above, a reuniting and fitting of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third animal associated with both bats and pangolins.
The evaluation of an animal from the SARS-CV-2 continues.
Besides the various kinds of animal breeders, there are three major factors on the side of the virus that are vital to making CVs cross the line of creatures.
First, their maximum number of changes in RNA frequency.
When compared with other RNA bacteria with one strand, the number of changes of CVs changes may be viewed as "small" to the "top" according to the ~10-4 changes per year by each 2 centre, depending on the CV combination of new hosts.
The CVs have cyclonenucles to seek error, its removal results in a higher and higher change of strength or failure to develop properly.
Interestingly, the Nucleotide with the loge Remdesivir is known to suppress the frequency of the CV by restricting this urmonucoreasse and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising causes against SARS-CV-2 to be tested in medical research.
Nevertheless, the number of changes in CVs is about one million times higher than those they didn't.
In addition, the number of changes is usually higher if the CoVs are not well suited to the environment.
Compared to the SARS-Cov with the highest number of changes, the number of SARS-CV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher degree of human tolerance.
Supposedly, it may already have been linked to another planet closely associated with humans.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to MERS-Cov, which is in good agreement with the guidance in the hydrodary.
It is thought that genetic changes may not be possible to cause goals and antibiotics against SARS-CV-2 if they do not work fast.
Second, the large RNA genna in the Covs uses additional simony to change and reunitement, thus increasing the opportunity for the co-evolution of various creatures, which is beneficial in the appearance of new CVs where conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the many different reading frames and the function of the protein produced by the 375 end of the genome.
Third, permanent Covs change the computers indirectly during the RNA repetition in a different way "to select copy".
In an organization that acts as a composite container, a change of type occurs regularly during the CoV RNA.
The homologous RNAs with full length and subgenomic may meet again in order to build new CoVs.
The biological proofs of reincarnation have been found in both HCOP1, HC43-OC3, and animal covs such as the bats-Cov and the botV-HKU9.
Epilepsy and Epilepsy
In addition to the three characteristics of the virus mentioned above, the cooperation of the virus with the immune system is another major factor that affects the combination of different creatures.
Here, the reuniting of the SARS-CV is considered a common example, which showed evidence of a rigid selection between the events of mutual tolerance.
Based on a comparison between separated persons and Civet-Covian SARS-Cov, it is assumed that the SARS-CV copes with the immediate reaction to the different hosts, especially with the changes in RBD of S protein.
Usually, RBD in the CV protein cooperates with the shipping host and is firmly chosen by the immune system.
In the SARS-Cov, RBD is at 31 mino acids per cent of S1, which adheres to ACE2 and its coreceptors to enter the virus.
The SARS-CV RB is able to see the ACE2 assignments of different animals, including bats, Civet, the mouse, and the raccoon dog, allowing the transmission of various species.
In fact, only 6 remains of a amno acid that was noted to be different from the division of human virus and the RBD in 4 are found in a motif attached to the branch in order to deal with the ACE2 assignment.
The SARS-Cov for Civet has a change of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may raise the level of Spike protein and ACE2 heir.
In other words, this transformation of two amno acids may be vital to the immune system in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same plate and SARS-CV.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CV in S-CV unit of SS protein means that the level of Sploes and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, the study of cyvo-EM shows a higher rate of 10- to 20-of this curve than between ACE2 people and SARS-CV protein.
It will also be interesting to decide whether another correptor is required for the addition of SARS-Cov-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is connected to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are other HCOV assignments, such as amnopeptase N in HCV-29E, and 9-O-Acetact acid acid acid of HC43.
They may also be seen as a reason for the success of the CVs in humans after the combination of different creatures from their animal breeders.
In addition to cellular sections, the result of the interlocking of various creatures with HCVs is also controlled by relying on another creature and on the elements of space.
The difference between these proteins between humans and strangers who are a natural source of HCVs such as bats, hydrogen camels, and rats may cause the line of sharing between different creatures.
HCOVs should take factors to rely on the owner and interfere with the movements of the movement so that there can be a successful union of creatures.
In this regard, cell - blocking decisions in this vital area will still be seen and noted.
A steady range of genomic selections of the system's reliance ons and birth factors of SAR-Cov-2 by the use of modern CRIPR technology may benefit.
New HCV appearance: returns at first
The variety of coconut covs provides many opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, bats serve as a collection of HCV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and recombination also lead to HCV evolution and serves as two important steps in this process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein nail has the power to change dramatically the positive strains of the virus.
Among the most useful proteins in SARS-Cov, ORF8 is thought to be essential in social relations, since the bats related to SARS-CV are separated but found to produce different orF8 proteins.
The component of the 29-nucleotide of the SARS-CV has been found in the species separated at the beginning of the epidemic.
This removal divides theORF8 into ORF8a and the ORF8b and is thought to be a consistent change that encourages non-conformation.
Besides, the SARS-Cov may have a history of reuniting with the alpha and gamma lists, where a large number of reuniting sites were found in RNA polymerase based on RNA.
The reunites were also found in nsp9, in most of the np10, and in partsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-Cov epidemic experienced events of reuniting between different lists, which took place in the hydrogen camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides the SARS-Cov and MERS-CV, events of reuniting have been observed with other HCVs, where HCVs reunited with other animal Covs in their non-specious genes.
It should also be noted that the selection may have a hand in undetermined changes to the immune system, which may result in the release of bacteria from the pressures of choice used, such as those of the immune system.
An example of these results is the loss of the ORF4 in the form of HCV-29E, due to the removal of the two Nucleotide.
Although the full ORF4 was seen in the bacteria of the bats and camels related to HCV-29E, the alca-CV displays the insert of one nucleotide, leading to the change of the frame.
Finally, but importantly, new HCV conversions are also under pressure to choose from its hosters.
There were no symptoms or only minor symptoms found when bats were added to the CVs, indicating a similar link between CVs and bats.
It seems that the bats are well adapted to the CVs in terms of structure and operation.
For example, the disorder of the use of reaction that promotes germination in bats easily reduces the Paththology developed by the CoVs.
Besides, the work of a killer of the bats is under pressure because of the rise of the NKG2/DCD94 host cell reaction, NKG2/CD94, and the low level of display of the cells of the complex Histocombubability.
In addition, the high level of creatures responding to oxygen (ROS) built by the job of high - food processing of bats may affect both the pressure of the CV recombination and affect the analysis of error with the necrobonics, thus providing the pressure for the development of most of the species of antibiotics when they are delivered to a new organization.
The principal types of PCs may also be changed by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or proteins for the combination of the environment.
As a result, it is not just a blessing that three new HCVs appeared two decades ago.
The CVs do not cause disease or cause minor symptoms to their main providers such as bats and camels.
They multiply quickly without encouraging strong reactions to the immune system.
Here are the secrets of why the carriers who do not have symptoms are identified and what causes critical conditions in people’s health.
The critical symptoms are mainly due to a high level of antibodies and cytokin storm where there are strong immune reactions, and the damage to the lungs is even greater.
In contrast, for those who do not show signs of illness, the reaction of the immune system has been doubled in the CV frequency.
The same plan to distinguish the reactions of the immune system may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong for the bats.
As a result, the use of interferon type I at least in the first stages of SARS-CV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, the use of NLRP3 inflammasome on bats is invalid.
According to this opinion, the NLRP3 inflammasome ban on MC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the usual form of SARS-Cov and MERS-CV.
Although a cota-Cov has been found in 95% of the Nuclear homology and SARS-COV, there is also a joint Comotact that shared 96% of the Nuclear hormone with SARS-CV-2.
Although Civersets and other animals in the market have been found to contain viruses such as SARS-Cov, the nearby middle-CV-2 animals have not yet been found.
Pangolin beta Covs have been found with the same structure as SARS-Cov-2, which indicates that the posongins may be some of the middle-case or non-Covian-V-V-2 non-caliins that may be contributing to the genetic components in the final version of the SARS-C-C-2 version.
Though the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is built by man either purpose or error.
The CVs returned to the screen because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The research of covs in the bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the importance of the origin of the ozone layer and of the HCV sources in human contact.
The widespread evidence shows that SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 have a narrow root and is passed on to people by the middle-men.
Since the addition of SARS-Cov from contact between the people and the Civets in the market, closing the markets of living animals and killing Civersets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
In the same opinion, the pangolins should be removed from the bonoological markets to prevent contact, considering the discovery of a number of subdivisions of pongolins closely related to SARS-CV-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals will still be explained in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-Cov has been on the camels for a long time.
These camels are not an important means of transportation and the main source of meat, honey, leather, and interest in the local people.
It is not widely circulated in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is unlikely that all camels will be killed in order to be controlled by MERS, as happened in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the transmission of SARS-Cov and SARS-CV-2.
To prevent the multiplication of MERS, a detailed method should be used to construct effective goals against the MERS-CV of the camel, along with other steps to control the disease.
Since we can eliminate the bacteria, newgenotypes may appear to cause outbreak.
The different types of zootic Covotic cootics are roaming in the wilderness.
In particular, the powerful coootic Covs are quite different.
There are many opportunities for these soooological Coovotics to change and reunite, resulting in new CoVs that are able to combine more closely with/or kill people in the future.
The custom of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to limit unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better program of preparation and response.
In fact, most microbes have long been present on earth.
They live in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many factors that promote the spread of germs, the opportunity for humans to communicate with bats and other wild animals can be reduced if people are taught that they are far away from them.
Further examination of mammals is needed to better understand the CV and its natural proprietors, which will be useful in preventing contact from animal to humans and future outbreaks.
At the end, the best way to prevent the ozone layer is for humans to move away from the environment that is the natural source of the ozone layer.
A few parts of the SARS-Cov-2 discs package have not yet been found.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 to the pongolins, it will be beneficial to see under what conditions the bats and the posongins can share in the same environment.
Second, if bats play the most meaningful role in human contact, it should be discovered how people communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a true center environment, the way it interacts with various human beings, bats, and pangalins should be explained.
Finally, since many mammals as well as pets may be exposed to SARS-Cov-2, both monitoring and distribution of research should be done.
If it may be bats, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CV-2 or its parents are about to be found in their natural environment in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the SARS-CoV-2 of animals, with significant results in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the population.
A review of the subject of screening of those who are "indicted" and "not assured" that they have a COVID 19 is required.
On 6, February 2020, our team had published the latest advice on a quick test and treatment of the new conronavirus in 2019 (nCov), and this date provided our experience and a suitable insurance policy to combat the global epidemic.
However, the 20th Cronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the new disease, our awareness, and understanding is increasing on the basis of continued research and medical experience; hence, testing techniques and treatment continue to decrease.
In this book, we have answered one comment on our passport and presented a new subject of the search for those who are "indicted" and "profoundly assured" that they are sick in accordance with Dialogues and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-Cov) was responsible for the outbreak, now called cornavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named after the virus as the number of spatory cornavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a plague.
In order to ensure the addition of the SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed the key of immediate response and is printed on the Internet in the Control Medical Research in 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since it has been printed.
Note, however, that COVID 19 is a new disease, caution and knowledge of it is increasing on the basis of research and medical experience; hence, testing techniques and treatments continue to decrease.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVIID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://w.nc.gov.c.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3, March 2020, have released seven volumes when other things were changed dramatically.
Our guide received notice from Zhou et al., introduced a simple presentation of points based on their experience.
Their work brought new evidence of our cause and made important reference to this global epidemic.
We praise their vital work and express our gratitude.
Their maker, however, needs a replacement in accordance with the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (The seventh study edition) and later research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to ensure a suspected illness, it needs to be cleansed of any one of the features of the epidemiological history and two of the exhibitions for extensive revisions, or needs to meet the three characteristics of a treatment that does not have a clear epidemiological record:
The history of the epidemiological: (1) the history of a visit or environment in the city of Wuhan, or of other communities where the COVID-19 reported before the beginning of the symptoms; (2) the history of contact with persons connected with SARS-Cov-CV-2 (in study of illcic acidic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients who suffer from cold or breathing in the city of Wuhan and environments, or other communities, or where it has been reported in the days before CVIOID19; or other communities prior to the history of patients, as well as well as 2 homes, including families, including families, in schools.
Medical evidence: (1) fevers and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) features of CVOVID-19; (3) a total number of white blood cells indicate normal, low, or low in the first stage.
A confirmed diagnosis should be based on a specific medical diagnosis that has one of the subsequent proofs of apathogenic or erological evidence: (1) a thorough examination of the PCR's real time period of SARS-CV-2; (2) a complete met met met met met met metomomomomogenic reaction to the known microbirrus; (3) to have the right body protection of IGM and the body of the IGSV-CODOXD-SCOX; or the right body change of the body is more severe than the X-SCOSD-SCOSC), or the result of the XSCSCSCSCSD.
We see that the actual time - tested PCR of Nucleic acid in the respiratory or blood samples in the second series (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pharmaceutical instance (27 January 2020) and five (8 February 2020); and the erological evidence is included in the seventh order.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers to consider the high gain of a high nucleic acid scan, as well as the models of breathing that include blood samples, which increased the availability of different muscles, and supported the effect of the body’s immune effect on a given matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence that reminds us to be alert to patients who have unusual symptoms and who do not have symptoms.
Hence, the Zou et al. chart should be replaced, as it refers to a person who does not have the symptoms of treatment as “like a low risk. ”
The method of reasoning also needs to be confirmed at work and in continuing medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and ask the disciples to mark.
For a test of "disposable" and "discernable illness", we recommend that it be followed and listened to the new international channels in their home.
Our weapon will again return to our readjustment so that we can offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number of day
yesterday, Bangladesh guarantees five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that date.
This is the highest number of days caused by the virus.
Since yesterday, the Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reports that the reported number of sick people is 111 and 33 who are homeless.
A total of 17 people who have died have been recorded.
In the online media section, director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two were between 1 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two were coming out of Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID 19 was a plague on March 11.
The hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifr Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Cruption Commission, who was cared for in the Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
On Saturday, at the Internet video announcement, the Dutch Cargon minister Obaidul Quader said that public transports would be banned longer than that planned, until the next Saturday.
This blocking of public transport had begun on March 26 and had been scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods - treatment, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, for two persons who returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, these three have already recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cornavirus cases exceeded one million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University date.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by corronavirus.
This happened on the same day when Malawi confirmed her first colonavirus and Zambia had her first death related to corronavirus.
North Korea, beginning on Thursday, is one of the few countries that do not have corronavirus.
Last day, the World Health Organization has compiled a report of 1,551,635, which includes 79,332 illnesses for 24 hours before a.m. according to Central European Europe (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of colonavirus have been recorded, associated with nearly 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News reports, quotes the Johns Hopkins University chart, that more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday are due to the combination of corronavirus.
Throughout the world, countries have declared tough measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobani, a city in Moscow, fled the city from the city until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia will continue to be paid outside the work force until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament has agreed to extend the international emergency in 15 days; the vote is issued by 215 approved votes, 10 votes, and one has a vote against this.

Thailand plans to use time for returning home between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The Ohio emperor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had declared its residence order until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the cost of buying a small home paper for each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian shopping network Woolworths and Coles reduces its purchase of toilet paper so that one can buy two and one pack in each store throughout the country, respectively.
ALDI also sets an end of one pack, Monday.
These limits are set as messages on exit, and on the Facebook pages of this store.
The consumers were still buying their pile because of fear of COVID-19 if they had to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworthths re-contained the purchase of the toilet paper for those who were sent home for one pack per oda.
These changes follow ahead of the end of the four-pounders in buying each of the wolworthers and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8, reported that at the end of the four-pounders placed, "most stores are still missing after the hour of its delivery"", and mentioned the need for "a" which cannot be compared"", whereas ALDI, in its Facebook state on Tuesday, says "Unexpected"."
"The sale of "" has increased too much" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
The Corsco shop in Canberra also holds the allowed number to be two units last week.
In order to deal with the loss, Coles deodes of the largest lungs for the surgeons and also announced the increase of the discharge, Woolworthos is added to the extension, while ALDI makes a specially set-interoper on Wednesday to be found immediately.
Russell Zimmerman, the top director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that merchants are trying to raise the votes, but the limits of the local court on the time of the truck breaking.
He expects the production costs to rise, as surgeons try to meet the need, with a few helicopters.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early release of the locker, some stores could not continue with a Wednesday helicopter.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortier, a marketing expert from Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill the lock every night.
Note that a small home paper is a heavy material, leading to a low number of packs when it comes to numbers, and, once finished, it leaves a large opening, strengthening the feeling that it is worshiping.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were so many things in the shelves, if a product like the trucks of a small piece of paper and a pinhead may be [to be purchased] and there is an abundance, you can probably reduce the fear expressed by Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The recombinant of the Who Gives a Crap is said on Wednesday and disappeared.
Kimberly-Clark, who performs the Kleex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, insists that they work 24/7 to keep the product available, according to a News.com report.
Domain.com, house sales license, reports that some real - estate vendors offer free paper to the first retired person in Melbourne, where a few items are held because consumers have time to rest because of the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of the NNT News, a daily journal of Darwin, put a nine - page appendix designed for cutting and using it as a secret paper.
The stores were at first hesitant to set limits, according to an ABC report on March 3 when they said they had no plans to open up credit limits.
Russell Zimmerman also said that some products also have a high demand, including tomatoes, potatoes, dried foods, soup, and flour.
Similarly, except in Australia, on Sunday night the Supermarket that sells on the British Internet was seen handling the sale of the Andres's private paper so that it would be twice as much as 12 trucks.
The World Health Organization calls COVID-19 by plague
Third, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called the continuing outbreak of COVID 19 — a disease caused by Cronavirus SARS-Cov-2 — a epidemic.
"And the word "Axes" refers to the extent of the disease we have been affected, not the way specific cases are dangerous, WHO has shown concern about the need to run governments in action:"
All countries still cannot reverse the epidemic.
If countries investigate, investigate, are here, divide, and respond by taking control of the human life span, says Tedros Adadin Ghereyesus, WHO’s Director of Control.
We are very concerned about both the terrible and difficult spread as well as the lack of emergency at frightening levels.
" According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic "no previous comparison.""
"He said, according to the marked CNN by February, "Without the virus, no other respiratory infection has been followed from its beginning until it spreads around the world."
"Greyesus has expressed a similar view, "" "We have never seen a plague which has been caused by the conronavirus."
"You continue," "and don't hide before we see an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new phase of the epidemic follows the January January resolution of calling evolution as a global concern for the emergency of public health.
"U.S. director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "left, still worse." "
Since Fourth, the Associated Press reports that there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading more than 4,600 dead.
The 2020/20 crossnavirus epidemic is the continuing pandemic of cornavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe's chance of sparoperation cornavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was held in Wunhan, China, in December 2019, declared the Public Health Emergency Worldwide In 30 January 2020, and it was considered a plague on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, 1.61 million accurate examples of COVID 19 have been reported in 210 countries and borders, leading to 97,000 who died confidently.
Some 36,000 people are calm.
The number of examples of extinction has been estimated to 4% in China, at the same time, from 13,04% in Algeria to 9.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, humidity, and lack of air.
Problems may include pneumonics and acture for performance.
The period of exposure to symptoms usually lasts five days, but it can be from two to fourteen days.
There is no known cure or treatment that can conquer the virus.
A basic method of treatment is to look at the signs and care that help. High - tech protection measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance between you and others, and keeping watch over and separating yourself from people who suspect that they may be exposed to them.
The authorities around the world have already responded by setting limits on travel, division, travel periods, risk control in the workplace, and the disposal of land.
The plague has led to severe economic and social upheavals around the world, social degradation or rejection of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a lack of resources for instant purchases.
Schools including universitys are banned throughout the world or in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the world’s students.
Miscarriage information about the virus has spread to the Internet, and there have also been cultural differences and racial discrimination among Chinese peoples, other peoples from the East and their ancestry in North Asia, and others from the affected areas with many cases of infection.
As a result of the reduction in travel and census rates of large factories, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon atoms.
The health authorities of Wunhan, China (Hubai state capital) reported a host of foreign - origin examples of pneumonia in March 31, 2019, and the investigation was opened early January 2020.
Many examples were related to the Huananese Seafood Wolise Market so the virus is thought to have a biological origin.
The outbreak virus is known as SARS-Cov-2, the virus that begins to develop closely associated with the insect, the polynaviruss of the pine, and the SARS-CV. The first known person who showed symptoms was later discovered that he began to get sick in December 2019, and that person never had a direct link to the web of our mitrkt.
In the first series of examples reported in December 2019, three parts were found to be connected to the market.
On 13, March 2020, an unprovable report from the South China Morning Post raised that the following example back in 17 November 2019, of a 5th - year - old person of the state of Hubei, may be the first. On 26, February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are reported, they are growing rapidly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new examples outside China and then past the number of new Chinese examples.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with light signals.
By 26 February, small examples had been reported among young people, those who had 20.4% of the world's examples. The chief science counselor of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Valance, considered 60% of British society to be in need of intervention so that the end of the end of the continent will be reached.
Examples refer to the number of persons surveyed by COVID-19, and their studies confirm the proof of legal recognition.
Since 23 March, no country has studied more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws that avoided examinations of those with only mild - tempered symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey published in 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID 19 had not yet been found, and this unwritten link is the source of 79% written cases.
A study of statistics published in March 30 estimated that Italian entry figures are much higher than reported examples.
1.4 to 2.4.4 (R.0) COVID 19 is 1.4.4.
Research published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that there may be 5.7.
Most people with CVOD 19 are healthy.
Those who are not ready, the period from the appearance of the signs to death is 6 days and 41 days, most often 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths have been placed as a reason for COVID-19.
In China, from 5 February about 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% already have health problems involving heart disease and diabetes. The official figures for the COVID-19 epidemic usually refer to people who have been diagnosed with COVIDD in terms of the law.
The true COVID-19 is probably too large, since it does not include everyone who dies without checking - ib. at home, at the elders's home, etc.
An eclipse from Italy found that the number of excessive deaths during the epidemic declined official figures of death due to COVID in 4-5x.
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the specified number of deaths] is below"", a statement consistent with the acdotal statistics of U.S.. Such comparisons are usually occurring when there is a plague, such as the H11N1 rape in 2001. The first death was confirmed in Wun in January 2020."
The first deaths that took place outside China itself took place in 1 February in the Philippines, and the first deaths that took place outside Asia took place in France in 14 February.
In 28 February, except in China itself, more than twelve deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and areas had reported deaths, all over the continent except Antarctica. There are several steps generally used to count deaths.
These numbers vary from place to place, and are influenced by the extent of testing, the nature of health care, treatment, time from puberty, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. Death-to-cases show the number of deaths and divides by the number of examples studied during a certain period.
In support of the Johns Hopkins University statistics, the Global Death-to-to-catio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the ratio of Death-toase has dropped from 17.3% (of those who have symptoms appearing in January 2020) to 0.7% (of those who have symptoms that appear in February 2020). Other measures include caffeine fever (CFR), which indicates a percentage of people who die from disease, and ininfertial fever fever (FR), which shows a percentage of participants (infR) who have been diagnosed with a disease.
These statistics are not based on time and follow a number of individuals from the introduction to the model solution.
Several academics tried to calculate these numbers of individuals.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evil-Baed Medicine calculates that the input factor of a global epidemic is between 0.01% and 0.39%.
The higher estimates of this level are in line with the results from an unprecedented study of COVID-19 in Germany, and a study of statistics that review the results of the study estimated by CFR.
WHO assert that the plague can be controlled.
True height and height are not guaranteed and can vary from place to place.
"Maiej Boni of the Pen State University said, "If left unchecked, condensation weakens the creation and begins to slow down when the disease disappears.
"But it’s almost impossible to make the present full speculation as to when that will be."
"The chief medical adviser of the Chinese government, Zong Nanshan, said "It may have been already finished by June" if all countries can perform an international movement to follow the WHO's initiatives to prevent the spread of infection."
"17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke that SARS-Cov-2 "will walk with power, a year or two." "
"According to the Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be needed until the solution is available (by washing the 18 months or more)." "
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is not possible that this corronavirus" will easily pass to each other (because it will disappear forever""" may also "be converted to "a disease of the seasons, returning annually"."
The backbreak will depend on the strong protection of the flock and the degree of change
COVID 19 symptoms may be negative in another and people who are affected may not have any symptoms.
The most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, fatigue and nausea in the chest (phlegm), loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea, or cynosis. WHO states that 1 person in 6 is seriously ill and has a respiratory problem.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list that shows signs of emergency symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, chronic pain in the chest or depression, loss of chest, stroke, stroke, and cancer or lips; rapid medical care if these symptoms are present. The progress of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia disorder, diabetes syndrome, spongs, spongs, and death.
Some of those affected may have no symptoms, no medical symptoms, but their diagnosiss confirm intervention, so researchers have suggested that those who have had close contact with those who have been confirmed must be careful and tested to make sure that there is no infection.
China's ratio of non-financial signals range from 4% to 4%.
The normal period of warming (the period between the transmission and the onset of symptoms) has a distance from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. To make an example of uncertainty, to estimate half of the people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and later dropped by 15%.
Some details of the spread of disease remain to this day.
The disease is believed to spread primarily between close contact and small points formed when you cough, yaw, or speak; when contact is about one to two feet [1 to 2 m] in diameter (3 to 6 knots).
The study has found that the uncovered curves can lead to a distance of up to 25 feet [4.5 m] (15 m) to 8.2 feet (27 m) in diameter.
Some have raised that the virus may be transmitted by small doses of long - term air, which can be present during conversation. Respire can also be developed during breathing releases, including when speaking, even though the virus is usually not moving in the air.
Cottons can sit in the eyes or in the ears of people nearby or may be pulled into the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as anti-inflammatory and cardiopolmonary resusatory (CPR) may cause breathing loss to become heated and the result is a result of air pollution.
It may also disappear when someone touches the infected area, which includes the skin, and then touch the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
Or there is concern that they may increase in noise, a danger that they believe is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the outbreak of the SARS-CV-2 by touching the mouth after contact with the ground. The virus has the risk of close contact within the first three days of the first signal even though the spread may occur before the onset of symptoms and the final stages of the disease.
People tested were diagnosed with the virus up to three days before signs showing that transmission could occur before the development of important symptoms.
Only a few reports of examples with no sure sign of the bull display, but outside the sign has been captured during a follow - up survey.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it does not fully explain how easily disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus continues to live for hours to more than things.
Directly, the virus is found to be found until three days in plastic (polypylene) and 304 in a starinles tester, one day on cards, and four hours in the stomach.
This, however, differs from the temperature and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have actually been found to have COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, even though British man has commanded that man wash his hands after touching animals, as after touching areas where infected people may be infected.
The Severe's postpartory syndrome 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a new virus, which began to be separated from three people who had pneumonia in contact with a multitude of examples of respiratory infections in Wunhan.
All the symptoms of the new SARS-Cov-2 occurred in a natural form of corronavirus. Without the human body, the virus is killed by domestic injury, as it weakens its external protection. SARS-CV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CV.
It is due to having the origin of acne from an animal.
Genetic research has revealed that corronavirus is normally associated with the form of Betacornavirus, the lower kinds of Sarbecovirus (lineage B), and the bats.
It is the same as 96% of all samples of other bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amno acid in certain parts of the genetic structure between microorganism and that of humans.
All the comparison of elements to this day has found that it would be 92% of the actual elements between the poonnavirus and SARS-Cov-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolis are internal keepers.
The transmission of the virus may be possible in some cases by detecting symptoms, though certainty is eventually produced by converting the translucent mouse back (rRT-PR) to the spreader or by the CT image.
A study that compares PCR to CT in Wuhan has raised that CT is more sensitive than PCR, even though its accuracy is lower, since many of its images of a group are in some of the causes of pneumonia and disease.
"From March 2020, the American College of Radio raises that "CT should not be used to investigate or whether it is the first method of testing COVID-19". "
WHO has published RNA's statistics for monitoring SARS-Cov-2, the first one issued on 17 January.
The test uses aral-time later end endoration postalization action (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be made either by means of breathing or by blood samples.
The results are often found in a period of about a few hours per day.
This test is usually made with a shohohopharyingal tube even though the vocal tube is also not used. The number of rubies and companies promote natural warming, which is capable of finding antibodies.
Since 6, April 2020, none of these have developed as well as being accurate to obtain universal use.
In US a test of the natural system developed by Cellex is allowed to be used with emergency conditions only with certificates only.
The features of the image for the radar and compact tomography (CT) people who display symptoms include assynmmetrical crystal crystals and absity crystals related to flilis.
The Italian Radiocal Society includes a global database to be found with images of proven examples.
Because of the spread of other diseases such as adennovirus, taking pictures without the PCR guarantee has a limit to indicate COVID-19.
A major study in China has compared the effects of CT chests with PCR and showed that while the image has a small degree in venerating the transmission, it is very fast and sensitive, raising the view as a testing tool in the pyramids of the epidemic.
Evolutional and environments are based on aartification system that has been developed so that they can check the characteristics of the pathogens through both radioographs and CT.
Antiterrorism strategies include keeping personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unscathed hands, and coughing or yawing using a sheet of paper and putting a piece of paper directly into the trash.
Those who may have gained access to the public are encouraged to wear a mask.
Environmental measures are also promoted to prevent transmission. Many governments have set limits or warn of unnecessary travel or of coming from affected countries.
Yet, the virus has reached the level of widespread distribution in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still spread among communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how to get involved. Health professionals who care for someone who may be involved are encouraged to use a fixed method of caution, care to keep contact, and to protect the eyes. Following an important procedure to health authorities has seen the source of tolerance and prevent continued transmission.
Using a plot of land from the kitchen to the government for this purpose has removed concern over privacy rights, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations are releasing a stamp that calls limits on this view.
There are various caps of mobile phones installed or elevated for voluntary use, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional teams have worked with related and secret solutions, such as using Bluetooth to install a user interface to other mechanic-cush.
Users can now get a message when they have been approached with someone tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. There are conflicting theories of how to prevent transmission; for example, cleaning the nose and chewing the moutsh does not work.
There is no cure for COVID-19, although most organizations are involved in building it.
Hand washing is encouraged to protect the spread of disease.
The CDC raises that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially when going out of the toilet or body appear to be dirty; before eating; and after a short, coughing, or vomiting.
The reason for this is that apart from the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, for it spews out its protective rifle.
The CDC has also recommended the use of a hand-based hand-based hand-based handy for at least 60% of alcohol with a volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unhygienic hands.
The areas can be fed into pollution by a few solutions (and during one minute of exposure it kills germs in place of stainles), including 62–71% of the ethanol, 50% of the soypropanol, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 05% of hydrogen peroxide, and 0.7.5% of povine.1% of podine.
Other solutions, such as banalconium chloride and chloxide gluconate, work at lower levels.
The CDC recommends that if the example of COVID is criticized or confirmed in such places as office or care, all such places as offices, toilets, public facilities, equipment used by all as libraries, related frames, credit cards, remote control systems, and ATM devices that are used by patients, it must be killed by germs.
Health organizations encourage people to mask their mouth and nose or nose when they cough, cough, or sneeze, and immediately discard any noise.
The maskis are raised by those who may have been involved, as wearing a marski puts a limit on the volume and the number of breath particles that burst out while speaking, yawling, and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines regarding the time and manner of the use of the mask.
" According to Stephen Griffin, virologist in the University of Leeds, "Maski's clothing may reduce the tendency of [people] to touch their face, which is the greatest source of involvement outside proper hand hygiene. "Amaski is also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may have a disease."
WHO has recommended that patients who are not sick can wear marskis only if they are in high danger, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing tasskis can help people avoid touching themselves.
Many countries have begun to recommend that members of the community have to use eye - controlled masks.
In the U.S., the CDC encourages wearing a cloth mask instead of using health - care providers. China has specifically recommended that members of the community use deployed health masks, especially if you are close to one another at six feet [3 m] or less.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgeon mask when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded areas.
Health workers in Thailand's encourage people to make fabrics at home and clean them all day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed off the public without wearing a marski or covering the nose and mouth.
In March, the Vietnam asked everyone to wear marski when he went to public places to protect himself and others.
The Austrian government insisted that anyone entering a restaurant wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all of the inhabitants to wear royal masks while in the community.
Taiwan, as it has been producing ten million manskis a day since mid - March’s middle, has asked city passengers and busers to wear an eye mask on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear face masks whenever you go outside, at the same time encouraging yourself to build face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy their masks.
The local maskis were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Resilience (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control a joint that are intended to improve the spread of disease by reducing personal contact.
Roads include separation; travel barriers; school barriers, employment locations, stadiums, tractors, and shopping centers.
Individuals can take advantage of ways to isolate themselves from living at home, to delay visiting, to avoid crowded places, to greet one another without touching one another, and to separate themselves physically from others.
Many governments now force or encourage the socialist movement in those areas that have been hit by the epidemic.
The higher attendance of the U.S. government and health institutions was suddenly reduced to 250 persons (if there was no COVID-19 in place), was placed at 50 peop, and later reached 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed the social gathering of more than two people. Older adults and those with such health conditions as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, and the immune system are facing the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay home as far as possible in infected areas. At the conclusion of March 2020, the WHO and other health branches began using the term ‘ separation of isolation, ’ which means that it is intended to reduce the physical contact in the same way of communication, or communication.
"The use of the term "" for social isolation" then leads to the conclusion that people must have a full share in permanent isolation, which may encourage them to continue contact with others in different ways. Some authorities have provided guidelines for sexual health that are not used while the plague continues. "
These include the encouragement to engage in sex alone with a roommate, who does not have the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
House isolation is encouraged to those who have been contacted with COVID 19 and who suspect that they may be involved.
The health - care providers have issued a directive designed to isolate themselves properly; many governments have either enforced or promoted permanent restraints of all citizens in the affected areas.
The heavier instructions of closing the home are passed on by those in high - risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a new country or expanded regions are encouraged to be locked for 14 days since the last time it could be interpreted.
The plan to control the epidemic is to shut down or exert pressure, and to reduce.
Tattooing is followed in the first stages of the epidemic and is intended to hunt and separate those infected and that other programs have been developed to prevent the spread of disease to others.
If it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are beginning to cut back on the level of decreases: measures are taken to improve productivity and reduce its impact on health and public health care.
Bending both closets and cutting down may be followed at the same time.
Stress requires very strict measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the relatively simple birth rate below 1. Part of the control of the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as mutualization.
This reduces the risk that health services are discovered become frustrated and allows more time for drugs and solutions to be developed.
The silent intervention of drugs that can control growth involves personal protective measures, such as handwashing, wearing face - to - face masks, holding tight, community measures intended to cut down schools and flagletting public events; sharing in encouraging the public to accept and take part in such sach; and so natural measures such as cleaning areas. The more intense acts of exposure were taken in China when the size of self - improvement became apparent, such as total closing cities, and forcing laws.
Other countries have also found different steps intended to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced public watchings and gave access to public arrests, and it gave warnings about the movement of those involved.

A study of the epipactory cornavirus type 2019 Covid-19 and SARS-CV-2 virus dealing with it includes ways to see the presence of a virus as well as those that see the antibodies formed as the result when a person is added.
The presence of viruses in the bookmarks is verified by RT-PCR that determines the existence of a coronicavirus RNA.
the study was specially designed to study the SARS-Cov-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm the recent or present diagnosis of disease.
An antibodies, arsonology, can be used for both the diagnosis of a person’s disease or the care of the host.
A study of antibodysurgery shows how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to say they were not given or had no symptoms at all.
An accurate number of death rates for this disease as well as the level of the public in general can be traced to the effect of this test.
Because of the limited number of studies, by March 2020, no countries have access to the number of virus in their community.
In March, no country has studied more than 3% of its population, and there is a great difference in the number of surveys done in different countries.
These differences may have a profound effect on the death toll reported in some countries.
By the use of the lucid-time rescription postsystem action, RR-PCR, the test can be done in different forms, including nesophasparengeal zab or sputum.
The results are usually available within two to two days.
A study called RT-PCR by vocal shebs can be trusted only in the first church of the disease.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but then continue to increase in the lungs.
For people with a second week's diagnosis, another sample metater may be taken out of the deep-saturial channels by means of a tectiter or by clicking a materal, sputum, is not used.
Some of the first PCR tests were developed in the Charter in Berlin in January 2020 with the use of the public-time power power exchange service foraction, irRT-PCR, which provides the basis for the distribution of 250,000 knots by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing in January 2020. South Korea Kogenebiotich promoted the PCR-based SARSCOV-2-i-i-i-i-i-in-avit's degree of research at the clinic in January 28 January 2020.
"Intricate "A" "Eegen" is the same in all the betta cornaviruss and RdRp loge available only in the SARS-CV-2. In China, BGI Group was among the companies who obtained approval for the critical times in China to use the PCR-AR-SAV-CV-2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CV, the CV-Cal-Cal-C, the CV-Cal-CRTTR-CRTRTRTRT-PRT-C.
Three of the genes on the old checks courses of checks caused the side effects because of the ineffectiveores and the limited inspections of the CDC in Atlanta, this resulted in a scale of less than 100 copies in a day that was successful throughout February 2020.
The study of two parts has not been found until 28 February 2020 and until then the provincial and regional survey offices were allowed to begin.
This method of testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authority. The independent testing establishments began at the beginning of March 2020.
In March 2020 the Lab Corp declared the international availability of the COVID-19 survey based on RT-PCR
TheQest Diagnostics likewise made the COVID 19 assessment since March 2020
No calculations were declared, collection and evaluation of spacins should be performed according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID 19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VERCTOR
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Survival in Health. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic has developed a type of testing for COVID-19. On 13, March 20,20, the Roche Diagnoss obtained a FDA license of a test type that can be done within 3 hours.5 thereby allow one machine to make a log of 48 hours in 24 hours.
In March 2020, the FDA has issued the Abbot Laboratories the approval of critical times, the EU, to check with the Abbott m 2000 policy, FDA has given the same approval.
On 21-March 2020, Cephed likewise received EUUA with FDA type of test for about 45 minutes.
FDA allows the type of testing that uses aisthermal nic acid amplication technology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this type can provide posthumous effects in five minutes and negative within 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 devices in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase its proposals to make some 50,000 studies per day. A study using amonal antibody that adheres to the Nucleocapid Protein, Nprotein, nonprotein proterus, is developed in Taiwan in the hope that it can not produce results in 15 to 20 minutes such as the study of a hyphenza.
"The replacement of the March 2020 texts concluded that "" chest-diagraphs do not help in the first stages and which is obtained from CT, a computer tomography, may exist before the symptoms begin to appear."
Common CT features include a blateral concentration ring-glis peripheric acid, astricial poststerism.
Subplulal dominance, crazy papping and cosolation are growing as the disease changes.
A survey that compares PCR to CT in the place where the plague started suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR but does not have details, many of which are associated with other pneumonics and disease procedures.
"According to March 2020, the American College of Radioology encourages that "CT can be used to sift or evaluate COVID-19 for the first time" "" according to March 2020, the CDC encourages PCR on first death."
Part of the eclipse in handling disease is the production of antibodies, including Igm and IgG.
These can be used to monitor the presence of disease after 7 days or more began the symptoms of infection, so that the Assays can be seen in public usage and employment. They can be made major research centers , CLTs, or by pint-of-care-sing, PopT.
The high level of automated systems in many health - care centers will be able to work with the essays, but their availability will depend on the speed and production of each one.
With CLT, only the normal peripheral blood spehemin, although serics are not used for immune reactions.
With PCT, a single specimen is usually obtained by injection of the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the action of shooting is not necessary before the essay. On 26 March 2020, FDA introduced 29 columns that reported the argy as necessary and is now able to distribute their antibody satellites.
According to 7 April 2020, it is only one method of screening that FDA is allowed under the approval of critical conditions. By the end of March 2020, the Euroimium Medical LaboratoryDiagnos and Exquare Dignostics obtained the approval of its European satellites that can check to see IgG and IgA anti-IgA against the Vimulators against the bloods.
The number of checks is several hundred times during an hour and is much faster than the Vral RNA photo.
The presence of antibodies is usually tested after 14 days of infection. In April, UK found that none of the antibody satellites that had bought them could be useful.
"In Hong Kong the program is established where suspects can stay at home, "the risk of emergency conditions which will provide the patient with a specien tube"", so that they can get back and get results later. The British NHS announced that it is beginning a research program to reduce the threat that the patient is contributing to the patient or the need to take care of a patient’s infection if there is a choice. May they also be blamed for the treatment of the CVIOD-BODUBUBODBOB-P, which is an effective health care officer.
The U.S. driving department has helped South Korea to make a most rapid study, most concentrated in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Threetary Health Administration Physicians spoke of 2 March, said that they have an average of about 12000 studies per day in the emergency session and have been conducted by 10.700 during the past week.
The cost comes from a health insurance report when a test is called by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the power to compile 160,000 checks a week.
Since March 19 a driving test has been given in many large cities.
Since 26 March 2020 the total number of German surveys has been unknown, since only true results are reported.
"The first study of the library showed that from the calendar week 12/200 a total of at least 4883,295 samples examined and included 12/2020 checks and 33,491 samples (6.9%) during the study confirmed the SARS-CV-2. Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambastan Hospital and examined the method of testing of 4 cases in the same period, by including a full-20thwartants, by adding a total analysis to the accuracy of the application of the report. The first-20th-20th-day "Uvers" is the "B" of the "Udu" of the "B" 20000-pope" and "B".
Since the building was still designed for the BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, the representation shows that the examples of Hubei would be high by 47% and that the proper cost of meeting arrests would be doubled if the capacity of loading tests had not been found in time.
The Wuhan Lab is quickly followed by the Huo-Yan cherubs in Sheanzen, Tiajin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From 4 March 2020 the total passing of the day is a total of 50,000 studies per day. The open, complex drawings released by Origam Assays are open so that it can check the samples of many patients until 1212 in COVI19 are used only 93 as a result. These computer models can work on smaller blocks without the need for water - producing robots.
Since March, the lack and limited number of REMegent has become a major factor in researching the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This led some authors to examine the policy of preparing samples that involve warming at 998 °C (228 ° F) for 5 minutes to release more RNA elements. By 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now studying the number of more people looking at Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was moving on a good foot to lift up a test to reach a large portion of the population.
"This was a combination of loading power beyond driving, and buying post-scarole tills-through caret on Group 42 and BGI (based on "Ho-Yan"").
Built in 14 days, the cherub is able to direct tens of thousands of tests with RT-PCR per day and the first on earth of this working level outside China.
Various tests of understanding for the different parts of cornavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German model for the construction of blocks sent to poor countries without their own resources.
The German policy was published in January 2020; the policy of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not found until 28 January, delayed studies available in U.S. China and the United States to deal with the confident problems of surveying at the beginning of the eruption, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and produce enough housing for health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive discovery of South Korea’s research has helped reduce the spread of new corronavirus.
The capacity to include testing, especially on private libraries, was developed over a period of years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the power of experiments as the best way to facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic. The high demand for screening due to the spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of workers to develop into U.S. libraries. independent, and the removal of SAbs and digital regeants.
In March 2020 the China reported problems with the accuracy of its checks.
"In the United States, checks built by the CDC are found to be "with" error", the government removed the walls of the law that prevented privacy checks. Spain bought them from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be incorrect."
The company explained that the wrong results may be the result of being judged to collect samples or use them properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would take them out of the cataracts, and it will put in their nose the different ticks performed for the Shenzhen Bioasy. 80% of the Czech Republic surveyors bought them from China with erroneous results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million ticks in China that were found to be inaccurate.
"The Prime Minister Matovič promoted rejection by installing it in Danube. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said that Turkish purchases were found in China with "a high degree of error" and didn't have been "used"."" "UK bought 3.5 million inspecters in China but at the beginning of April20 declared that it was not used."
Tests, followed by arrests of those who were found to prove their findings and were followed by those who had had contact with individuals who indicated that they had been investigated by SARS-CV-2, the results were also confirmed.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vu, the first COVID-19 death area in Italy, direct two round - up surveys of 3,400 people, at least ten days away.
At least half of the people surveyed had no symptoms, and all the examples found were closed.
Since the visit has been canceled, this removes a completely new partnership.
In order to follow the enthusiastic victims, the incoming visits are delayed, investigations, and haltings, the 2020th plague of cholera in Singapore continues far more smoothly than other developed countries, but without such difficult restrictions as forcing the blockage of food shops and other trades.
Many events have been identified, and Singapore began to advise citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but the schools opened in time after a vacation in March 23.
Several countries have also been able to protect the epidemic by means of a follow - up campaign, to speed up internal travel, to check, and to prevent, but to a small extent in silence, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that more countries, compared with the number of dead people, have lower rates of death, which may be the reason why they are in a better position to search out those who have or are not.
WHO recommends that countries with no ability to compile tests and have national libraries limited to COVID-19 who send the first and 10 positive estimates of COVID-19 in one of the 16 reliable libraries of WHO will ensure a test.
Among the 16 reliable libraries, 7 Asian, 5 European, 2 African, 1 North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "Containating for testing" is influenced by a national surveying process.
The only country that checks hospital admissions will have a number of recommendations for a % surveying of all its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, some things are the same.
To wash hands (or wash them), which is also known as hand washing, the act of washing hands with the purpose of removing the ground, the granaries, small items, or the suittas that are not needed.
The regular washing of hands in those "critical times" during the day protects the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are associated with oral sewage.
People can also be exposed to respiratory infections as common colds or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, elements that are still very sensitive).
Five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important: before and after the release, after cleaning the infant’s smile or changing the nails, before feeding the baby, before and after feeding and handling raw meat or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization promotes hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing the food.
Before and after treating a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used a toilet.
After a sneezing, coughing, or blowing.
After touching an animal, animal’s food, or animal pollution.
Sanitation of medical hands refers to sanitary procedures connected with the medical procedure.
Washing your hands before offering medicine or medical help can protect or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to wash your hands by washing their hands (batrogens, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for those handling food or working in the field of medicine, but it is an important procedure even in the general community.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, cornavirus, and other infectious diseases; in preventing related causes of diarrhea; in reducing respiratory diseases;
and reduce infant mortality rate at home delivery.
A 2013 study showed that the improved hand washing process may lead to little improvement during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate associated with respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by starting a simple behavior change, such as hand washing with soap.
A simple action may reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by about 50%.
Hand - washing methods can reduce diarrhea sessions in three stages, and this can be compared to performing clean water in areas with limited resources.
The reduction of the bath chapters in 48% can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. A hand washing is one simple, low - cost method for preventing diarrhea and accolatation therapy (ARI), such as a practical behavior that occurs in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Malaria, the largest ARI, leads alone as a cause of infant death in less than five years, is damaging an estimated 1.8 million children’s health per year.
diarrhea and pneumonia are both contributing to the deaths of nearly 3.5 million babies per year.
According to UNICEF, changing hands with soap before food and after using the toilet as a more persistent practice can save more health than any single remedy or medical intervention, deciding death for at least half the cause of diarrhea and death by respiratory infections in one part.
Hand washing is often associated with other exporting of waste as part of water, garbage and hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects them from the disease of gutitis that transmits one another by direct contact.
A slight risk is the result of regular washing of hands and skin damage caused by skin loss.
The Danish study of 2012 found that excessive hand washing can result in the bite, with the skin condition known as the hazema or hactitis, which is most common among health - care workers.
Several hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obssive-consulsive surgery (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing is important to reduce the transmission of the disease through the oral method: after using the toilet (resting, dissolving), after cleaning the baby (a change of pots), before feeding the baby, or before or/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Sometimes the proper method of washing the hands should be followed to avoid transmission of the disease, including before and after taking care of a cut or injury; after coughing, coughing, or shortness; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on an average, 38.7% of families follow the practice of hand washing with soap. The 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had a peak of 9 percent; the United States nearly 7 percent; and China at the lowest level of 23 percent. A few of the practices are now available in developing hand washing hands in critical times. The washing of a group of children in one day in the developing world was to increase their physical activity.
The "Estactual Health Care Program" that was introduced by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the work of promoting health and education for children.
To remove frames twice a year, it is accompanied by regular washing of hands with soap, daily sluoride, is a national policy.
It was started successfully and also in Indonesia.
Removing microorganism from the skin is better than putting soap or cleaning in water.
The primary function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the anti-inflammatory factors, and raise syluminity.
Water alone is not enough to wash the skin because fats and proteins, which are soil buildings, are not easily damaged by water.
But cleaning is done to a degree by means of running water.
The spore, being able to rejuvenate it, may keep the virus left in advance.
A small number of studies facing the transmission of the virus from a virus that has contracted pollution conclude that it is unlikely that bacteria will be cleansed with oxygen.
The CDC continues that it is also better to have "a shower of liquids and outside hand control."
Antiviral perfumes have been widely advertised by members of a health - care community.
To this day, there is no evidence that using antistics or anti-disincuts is a choice of natural antibiotic-resistant oxganisms.
However, antibacterial wings have normal antibacterial agents such as triosans, which have a long list of autostans that are organisms.
Thus, even if the antivitants are not selected for an antibacterial soap, they may not be able to work well in the way they are sold.
Besides being surfactant and a representative for the skin, complex structures may have aacid (accetic acid, arcic acid,lacic acid) as a rule of prH, antimioticlytic acid and other skin agents (aloe, vitamin, ratol, etc,plants pertractracts). A study of complex structures from the Office of Public School of Public Health shows that there are no similar benefits in the same way that the immune - carrying the immune system.
Hot water that is capable of washing your hands is not hot enough to cause infection.
Germs increase greatly when the fever is (37 ° C).
Yet, warm, soap - filled water is far more effective than cold water, which contains soap to remove natural oils that capture soil and germs.
In contrast with belief in abundance, scientific research has shown that using warm water does not contribute to lower microbial acid in your hands.
The ring of uninitizeer or card antistics is a symbol of water-cleanness.
At the end of the 1990s and early part of the 21st century, representatives of non-water-water washing (also known as alcool-bard rub rub rub rub rubs, antiseptic habs, or hactant nitizeers) began to get a shot.
Many based on the ipropyl alcohol or the ethanol that has been removed were combined with a burning representative such as Carbomer (polymer of aclic acid) to make a bullet, or a pipant as a glycerin as a liquid, or term so as to make it easier to use and reduce the dry temperature of alcohol.
Taking hydrogen-peroxide with fluid raises an antimactial function further. The sand sands have 60 to 95% which kill bacteria successfully.
Alcool bub sanitzer kills bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tibculosis, and other bacteria (including HIV, Herpes, RSV, CHinvirus, diaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and cholera.
The alcohol bub sanitzers with 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 mg), like 35 decibels by slow), of the pathogens in the hands in 30 seconds after fating and 99.99% to 99.99% of the bacteria in their hands for less than 1 minutes after the seizure. The hantanizers work well in the virus and are less active in certain pathogens.
The alkaline hanitiers made from alcohol are almost completely useless to the norovirus (or Norril) type of bacteria, the primary cause of a combined concentration of gastrophytic or alcohol rub should be used to transfer completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and in the middle and back of the fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds until the fluid, foam, or wheel is dry.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention encourages washing rather than rubbing the finger of a pins of mutizer, the grandmother when it is clearly visible that the hands are clean.
The rise in the use of these agents is due to their quick and quick action to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to take the place of proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Using alkaline nitizers based on alcohol can always cause dry skin unless it is inserted into the emollinities and/or leather Secrets in combination.
The process of alcool drying can be reduced or eliminated by inserting glycerin and/or emolliets in combination.
In medical research, the hant sanitizers based on alcohol containing emolliets make better skin loss and cold than soaps or antimidicrobial soaps.
A closerergic coctact dermatitis, conticacy syndrome or hypothermisity to alcohol or non-addicts available in the alcontactic habs are rarely available.
The low level of causing irriant contact dermatitis is attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their function, waterless representatives cannot wash their hands in the natural world, but they kill germs.
For this reason, the vatitzers do not work well as soap and water to protect the flow of most of the Pathogens, as the pothogens continue to be in their hands.
The success of the hanitiers without alcohol is largely dependent on the ingredients and combinations, and in history they work worse than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, the combination using balconium chloride has shown the persistence and growth of the antimidicrobial activity after anointing, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce working quality after repeated activity, may be due to continued body response.
Many people in poor economic communities are unable to buy soap and use it for fuel or soil.
The ashes or soil may work better than water, but they do little more than soap.
One of the most disturbing concerns is that if the soil or ashes find chemical-organisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like a soap, the ashes are also an antibacterial agent because when combined with water, an alkaline mixture is formed.
WHO encourages the ashes or sand instead of soap when soap is not available.
The proper treatment of hand washing recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Televisions includes these steps:
Let them wash their hands with warm or cold water.
Traveling water is encouraged because standing water may be contaminated, and cold or hot water conditions do not make the difference.
Wash your hands with enough soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Blood carries germs to the skin, and studies show that people often wash their hands thoroughly when soap is available rather than using water.
End at least 20 seconds.
Slamming causes heat, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and prolonged diarrhea removes more bacteria.
Clean under moving water.
Washing your hands in front of your eyes may defile them
He holds a clean towel or lets it dry in the air.
Water and moisture are easily absorbed by the hands, which are easily forgotten by the sixth, the event, the space between the fingers, and under the nails.

A sluice coat is often encouraged to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to damage that can raise the spread of disease.
Special nonprofit programs can be made to deal with hand washing where water pumps and/or soap are not available. To draw water by drawing a proper container or tube with a proper opening and/or using ashes if needed in the developing countries. In relatively limited water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are procedures that are a challenge to save water, such as "tippy-paps" and other types of saving money.
Tipy-AT is a simple method of using a rope-locked drum, and a leg-acter that carries small water in the hands and a soap pipe.
Working handwashing is an important part of the cleaning process, but there may be disagreement over how best to dry up in public areas.
A growing rate of research suggests that the safety ladders are better off than gas stations found in the bathrooms.
In 2004, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and supported by the European Tissue Simposium paper industry, to compare the levels of cleanliness found in the sheets of the paper, the hot - air palms and the latest wind turbines.
After washing and drying hands with hot gas, the total number of bacteria was found to be at the rate of fingers in 1947 and on hand to 254%.
A low - speed air dryer succeeded in rising at a maximum rate of infection in the fingers by 42% and in hand nets by 15%.
After washing and laying hands with a sheet of paper, the total number of the virus falls on the tip of the fingers in 76% and on the finger by 7%. Scientists also took a review that would indicate if there was a chance to join the crew of cleaning and cleaning facilities as a result of each method of drying.
The air-cushion tube, which flew from it at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 m), was able to fly micro-organisms in its hand and almost join other users and washers about a distance of about eight feet [2 m].
The use of hot air has spread the micro-organisms to a depth of 1.25 feet [0.25 m] from the queen.
The paper charts did not show any significant limitations of micro-organisms. In 2005, research directed by TüV Product und Omult, different hand drills were examined.
The following changes in the virus number after laying hands were observed:
There are many manual designers available, and hand mills have ever been compared to freezing with the blood towels.

An alcohol - made hanitzer must have alcohol by at least 60%.
Medical washing was enforced long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found its work (in 18646) to protect the disease in the hospital area.
There are electric drains that operate with a note reminding hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a reduction in the rate of infection by its operation.
Medical hand washing is 15 seconds, using a lot of soap and water or a wheel to anoint or wash each part of the hands.
The hands must be folded together by washing the fingers.
If there is any dirt under the nails, the crystal brush is not used to remove it.
Since bacteria can reside in the water on your hands, it is important to clean up and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if possible).
This avoid any further contamination of your hands in such areas.
The goal of washing your hands in a position of care is to remove afterwardogenic microorganisms ("germs") and then avoid passing them.

The World Health Organization "five times" to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/blood fluids
prior to an acetic function, once
and after taking care of the patient. Putting anti-injecting chemicals into the diuretic (" tree" or "mrobes") gives the power to kill in that washing of hands.
Those deadly powers may be required before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-estant conditions are common. 'Surgeing hands with someone for the operation of surgery, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and closed without touch, chloloxide or iodine wish, hair towels to dry hands after washing, and other derle rush and other derle uristryment to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This process requires the washing of hands and arms to reach the container, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of discharge (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you witness, the water in the arm should be restrained from running back into the hands.
After completing washing the hands, the hands are dried with asterile cloth or washing garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand - to - hand contact before and after treating a patient.
In order to control staphyloccal diseases in hospitals, it has been found that much benefit from clean hands comes from the first 20% of cleaning, and that it is less than the extra help available when repeated washing of hands is increased than 35%.
A low - value soap cleaning results in a three - degree rate of a disease of a infectious virus compared to a diet compared with a hyd-rubbing hypnotic solution. The comparison is with alcohol-babing treatment and with the hardness of a radioactivity for a median time of 30 seconds at the end of the albod with the albinal-rupic acidic acid solution.
But soap and water work better than alcohol-bard hand rub rub rub rubbs in reducing H1 to A virus and Clostridium discuses in their hands. The intervention to improve hand - care conditions may include training workers by washing their hands, raising the availability of alcohol-bad ham rub rub, and the written and oral reminders mentioned to the staff.
There is a need for further research to determine which of these means of entry works best in different health - care situations.
In developing countries, hand washing is recognized as a convenient means, an important tool for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
Yet, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or cleaning facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workshops presents a challenge to reach the world’s hand - washing habits.
In many rural areas of Africa, for example, handwashing pumps near one’s private or toilets are scarce, although there are no ways to build wash hands.
However, low - level hand washing may be the reason for more deeply ingrained habits than that of soap or water shortage.
Advertising and standing up to hand - to - hand washing can play a role in creating legal goals, raising awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and leading to changes in social behavior.
For this to work out, caution and order are needed.
A review of 70 studies found that public methods are effective in raising hand washing on the LMICs, while public advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools of UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, practical steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements for ritual cleansing.
When small levels are reached, schools can ultimately range from one to three stars.
Building washrooms can become part of the advertising campaign that is being done to reduce disease and death among infants.
Earth’s Day of Handwashing with one of the following examples of conscientious efforts to achieve a change of behavior. As a result of the 20-20th plague cornavirus, UNICEF advertised the general use of hand - washing hormones.

The value of hand washing of one’s hands – especially to people under weak conditions such as those who have recently brought them or wounded soldiers to hospitals – was first watched in the mid - 19th century through two doors of physical cleanliness: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmeliis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "I am beginning the modern nursing profession."
At the time, many people still believed that diseases caused by bad odors called measmas.
In the 1980 ’ s, outbreaks from food and medical diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand washing as an important means of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of hine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 CVIB in 2020 has led to higher awareness in many countries on the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from this type of infectious disease.
For example, the cathedrals with the text of the "right washing process" are displayed at the top of the public toilets and private rooms at offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "to wash your hands" for something, means to make clear to someone that you don't want to take responsibility for something or to get involved in it.

Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam insists to wash their hands before and after meals.
COVID 19 Risk Operation Management Management
The COVID-19 management controls the use of anti-inflammatory procedures to prevent colonaurus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate safety controls in the workplace depend on the working environment and the type of work, by supporting research on the dangers of exposure, the risk of disease in the community, and the risks to individual employees who may be weak in preventing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Organizational Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low - risk jobs have lower social contact with other employees, which include simple measures of protection, including washing the hands, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, and maintaining a healthy life - style, and keeping the cleaning and disinfecting process in the workplace.
The activities that can be exposed to internal danger include those that require constant contact and that are near strangers or suspected of developing COVID-19, but they may be infected because of continued social distribution or travel abroad.
This includes workers who are associated with a common community, such as schools, busy working quarters, as well as crowded business conditions.
The risk control in this group, above the protective measures of easy path, includes a ignitation that uses the high-efficicity quality bearings, sneezegiards, and the exercise of precontactication in conditions that are available to the person with COVOD-19.
OSA considers health workers who are exposed to people who are known or who are suspected of having COVID-19 as a higher risk of exposure, high risk of exposure if the workers make aerosol-generating procedures, or carry or handles from known persons or suspected of COVID 19.
The appropriate risk control in these operations includes building controls such as negative stress control, and the peronal protocol appropriate for work.
The outbreak of*COVID-19 may have serious consequences inside the service area.
Workers may be unemployed because of illness, the need to care for others, or because of fear of exposure.
Marketing habits may change, with both the desired kind of goods, which have the means of getting these goods (such as buying them at busy times or by sending them away or by driving jobs).
Finally, the transfer of items from difficult places COVID-19 may be disturbed. The preparation of a corresponding disease and reaction program can be used to direct protective action.
Programs view the risk factors involved in various work - related activities, including exposure, increased risk factors at home or in social situations, as well as the dangers of individuals ’ high age or of chronic illnesses.
They also explain the proper management of the risks, and the following programs of situations that may arise as a result of withdrawal.
Preparation for a related illness and emergency programs may depend on encouragement from the law of the country or from the provinces.
The goals for response to a mood disorder include reducing workaholism, protecting high - risk people from serious health problems, maintaining business activities, and cutting down on the hard results of other businesses and consumers.
The crisis of the disease in the community in which it is business affects the response measures taken.
The disaster control ladders are widely used for the regulatory and health in combination of the risk control of the consequences.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not satisfied, better control of construction control is followed by management discipline, and keeping personal protective equipment.
Building administrations include separating workers from work - related dangers without relying on the employee’s behavior, and it can be a very costly step when applied.
The administration of change in the work policy or procedures that require an employee or employer's action
Personal propactication (PPE) suggests less effective than building and management control, but it can help to avoid exposure.
All PPE types must be selected on the basis of the worker's risk, properly dressed as appropriate (b.,respirethas), and in the manner, checked regularly, stored, and changed, in the case of need, and removed properly, cleaned, and stored or discarded.
According to the U.S. Organizational Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low - exposure jobs may have little contact with the community and other social services.
Simple measures to protect the spread of the virus at all places of work include regular, strict washing of hands and hands, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, good breathing habits that include covering and excretting, dealing with coughs and pans, preparing for household work or shift turns, encouraging workers to avoid using tools and equipment, and continuing to maintain a program of cleaning and slaughter in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of people who may be infected are a vital step toward protecting employees, customers, airports, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with the symptoms of the acothological respiory llness must stay at home until there is no more heat, and other symptoms at least 24 hours without the use of drugs to reduce or change symptoms, and that the days of illness are stressful, allow workers to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that workers know these rules.
According to PSA, the activities that can be described include those activities that require regular contact or close contact with six (.8 m) individuals who are not known or who are suspected that COVID-19 patients, have an SARS-CV-2 virus because of continued collisions in a nearby community, or because someone has recently returned from a foreign land where there is an abundant distribution of COV-19.
These include workers who are associated with a common community, such as schools, high - level business facilities, and high - level marketing conditions. Building control of these high - risk groups includes installing the highest levels of work, raising the level of the wheel, providing limits as passports, and providing the control for the services of the public. The control of this highly motivated group includes encouraging personnel to stay in the home, including the use of private meetings, including security services, training programs, programs, and activities, and activities in the development of private programs, and activities in the field of the community, and other activities. The development of social media, and social stability, as well as well as connected with the stability of the services, and activities of the services, and activities that are necessary, including programs, including programs, and activities that provide a safe and activities that are necessary for the services of the
Workers in this group of confessional team are rarely required to use arsenic.
If a person begins to get sick on a plane, proper programs to control the behavior of employees and other passengers include separating the patient from others in six stages, putting one of the crew to care for the patient, giving the face mask to the patient, or asking the patient to put his mouth and nose through his nose when he bends or sneezes.
The cable cream must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body fluids or places that may be contaminated, and it may be possible to provide additional protection if the patient has a fever, chronic coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Giraffes and other missing items should be discarded with the biozard bags, and the sites that have found pollution should be cleaned and treated later. As for tankers, it includes tankers and other passenger vehicles, controlling the gear includes reducing the course when you are sick, and keeping them away and informing the medical center as soon as someone begins to heat or other symptoms.
If possible, a follow - up procedure must be taken to a private decomposition. In schools and day - care centers, the CDC encourages a temporary halting for the purpose of cleaning and disinfecting if a infected person is already inside the school building, regardless of the spread.
If there is little or no social contact, the means of permanent separation may be introduced as extroverts, meetings, and other large gatherings such as natural education, boarding classes or meals, increasing the gap between discs, arriving and taking turns, meeting out with less - important visitors, and using a different office of children with symptoms like cold.
When a virus spread in a remarkable way in the community, despite efforts to isolate people, it may be considered a direct ban on schools. For day - to - day legal workers, the health risks at that time are considered inferior to the CDC.
Lawmakers who are to contact individuals who are registered or who are suspected of having COVID 19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as health - care workers, as well as a person’s proper defense material.
If there is a closer relationship when a person is found, workers should clean and remove germs from their work belts and clothes before they use them again, and they follow the usual precautions to prevent spread of the disease and abandoned PE by keeping and washing clothes.
WHO estimates that some medical and exhausted workers are in greater or greater danger of exposure to disease.
The activities of those exposed to serious risks include medical forwarders, relief supplies, laboratory equipment, and medical personnel exposed to known patients or suspects of COVID-19.
These are the most serious risks of exposure to disease if the workers perform procedures that develop aerosol, or they collect or handle samples, from known patients or suspected of having COVID-19.
The processes that create the aerosol include hydraulic injections, abronchoscopies, procedures and certain dental checks, or collection of the body’s samples.
High - risk jobs include workers involved in preparing bodies for the bodies of people who are known or who are suspected of having COVID-19 at death; these become extremely dangerous when checking dead bodies. More and more automated engineers of these groups include private shelters for known patients or suspects that they have COVID-19, which include when procedures are developed for the formation of aerool.
Special ventilation through active force may be appropriate for some health and weight - care centers.
Samples should be handled with safety guidelines for Biosofty Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be separated from different waiting sites by any suspicion of having COVID-19. In addition, OSA encourages asspirators to those who work away from 6 confirmed patients, or with patients, that they have SARS-CoV-2, and those who develop the procedures that promote the aerool.
In the United States, therespitors whose facial masks are registered by NIOSH or better than must be used as a written form of defense system, which includes tests of good health, exercise, and medical tests.
Some types of refpirators can more protect and improve the worker’s condition. WHO does not encourage coverals, since COVID-19 is a disease that is transmitted by breathing and not by body fluid.
WHO only encourages surgical masks to surgical workers in the entrance areas.
To those who collect respirators, take care of, or deliver COVID-19 patients except for aerosol processes, WHO encourages surgery, harbours, or fasceeds, gloves, and gloves.
If aerosol process is developed, N95 or FFP2 refraction scans are replaced by surgical masks.
Because PEP is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing the need for PE by telephone contact with patients, special protections such as windows, allowing only those directly involved in treatment to enter a hospital with a COVOD-19 patient, to use only the needed PEPE for a particular job, continue using the same as prescribed to remove it while caring for a number of patients with similar diseases, watching and controlling the availability of PPE, and controlling the use of people who have a disease.

DEPARTEN: [Covid-19] To reduce the load and to prepare for the future
SUDDENTION: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
WARNING: CC0 rights reserved
We find ourselves in a unique position this month.
The COVID 19 epidemic is what makes it clear how people in the world are involved in each other’s responsibility.
We have never faced similar challenges, but we know that how we react to them depends on the compassion, cooperation, and social structure of the organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees by mail, phone calls, and discussions is remarkable proof that we have good working partners.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me how logical it is for the earth to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this powerful sign on which the key is to remain on the Internet and is available to everyone.
Your work is doing this, whether you keep the keys or our workers paid or our communities protected.
The world needs the knowledge available in Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is the time when not only we do what we do but also how we do it, which will have a profound effect on the earth.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make big changes in the way we treat one another, from the next week.
Changes in our work and in the neighborhood
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team - c has met that evening and discussed how we would work with our refrigerator for days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we felt would be a good response to what we had to face and what the best way to keep the organization moving forward during this period.
We can expect to eliminate stress and support our long - term goal.
If you have to correct the situation, it’s all right.
Of all workers, insurance companies, and concrete workers:
Our expected daily activity will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until a change is announced.
We do not announce a vacation — if you can work longer hours, the company may use it.
However, things are not sure in the world now, and whether you need to care for your loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first in our lives.
We will not be able to calculate the exact length of your work.
If you are sick, don’t work.
We certainly do not need to say this, but we will.
You do not have to enter the days of sickness or PTO - you will simply tell your supervisor and help your team to rebuild calendars and sharks to ensure that the main aspects of the work are being accomplished.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryan among the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that your situation is properly cared for by the management).
The workers who work hours will be fully paid.
We are already saying that, and we are busy to fulfill our obligations to our pension and to those who work hours.
Everyone will be paid for his regular hours of work in normal conditions.
This includes getting sick and not being able to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to bring their distress into harmony with the environment.
What we do can have a unique reward, especially at times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we can know what to expect and then be organized in harmony with it.
Other work is considered important.
There are things we must keep on doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and the Fundrasing (in others) perform a challenging task that you may need further support.
We will begin the process with every door to investigate current goals and expand our focus on supporting what is essential to our goal.
There is much that all of us need to do, all of us will focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now will not harm us later.
We do not plan the "working again to hold the speed" when the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete a job at an extraordinary time right now.
We acknowledge that circumstances have changed, and we will work to establish new goals and times when it is appropriate.
What happened with APP (Annual Planning)?
To change our new circumstances and hours of daily work, we plan to change our 2020-2021 export period.
Our aim is to suggest the extension of our 2020 ’ s that allows more time to make a budget for allowing workers to take the most important tasks first, to care for themselves, and to care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work less time in the next few weeks.
This assessment of the working age greatly reduces the current work schedule and pressures in the whole organization.
We will introduce our proposals to Boaz for the coming week and reward representatives and captives for the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
We are grateful for the majority of the AP by taking the lead in this regard.
Office status, appearance, and cleaning
Last week, we read that another SF worker may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, because of great anxiety, we have sent a cleaning team to remove germs from all parts of San Francisco’s office.
Use the medical soap from hospitals to remove germs everywhere, as well as in the reception area and in the home of the elvators that enter our area.
The building uses its system of maintenance by using products that support its network security.
We feel relieved that the office is ready when we decide to go back to it.
Our DC office is in We Work, which shared with us its COVID 19 protocol and all the workers in the DC.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area that has been completely removed in accordance with San Francisco’s direction.
As our fellow workers in NYC knew, we had been discussing property from Brooklyn.
These discussions persist but may take some time.
Some of our fellow workers worked as shift workers for the first time.
Our long - term workers know that it can be a big change, and they want to give you advice:
Reduce the length of the meetings to at least one or two hours.
If long - term meetings are needed, consider how you can break up within a number of days.
Make clear what the meeting is about you, bring out the opportune time for yourselves, and send out the things which you need to learn in advance.
Do so with video, tools such as Google Docs and Zoos to work and communicate.
Take the lead in preparing all the meetings, someone who will look up questions in the discussions and follow up on a series of talks, and someone who will help you write notes (or write notes all).
Send e-mail to electronic clients if you need a good session.
Use your safe money to buy expenses.
See the #remoties channel for Slack to discuss with your family about the work that is sent out.
The HR Operating Force needs guidance on Internet terminals through effective methods of operation to support the expansion of the work that is sent to the entire company.
During this past week we have asked all who receive back income in the community to make public events supported by Wikidia, such as Editons, WHO even announce that the epidemic is over.
We will tell them that we have come to realize that our request for insurance and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their savings and that no one will be paid for drinking or changing their goals.
In this coming week we will follow another direction to the rest of the province and the provinces.
The general sense of society in the world seems to be dissolving by disorder but free by explanations and opportunities to focus on their communities, the Wikidia, and so forth.
In time, CRT works to trace the page to Meta-Wki so that the public space is given to watch the response and follow our discussions with them.
To keep in touch with matters related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars on a coming Thursday, 14.00 UT/07:00 for a special meeting of workers.
We will use this time to respond to other questions, to answer your questions, and to spend some time talking to each other.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue getting information about this mail, and all the other basic knowledge of COVID-19 related to it, to the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep the changed pages and all information in the same place.
We also work to keep regular contact with the staff living in the countries currently very affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major job track, a malaria challenge, or anything else you may need, please do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We are here to help support and communicate when necessary.
If you have a secret or critical matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah - HR International Global Updates.
None of these changes need to be considered permanent.
Rather, they are aware that in this time, our work and our obligations will likely need to be adjusted as never before.
These are steps that they believe are needed to support one another in order to carry on the work, to give our support to our team, and to the world in which you trust.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is a time of mutual support and a time for valuable work that may be available in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to do that, so we need to take care of ourselves and your families so that you are ready when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and keep your face clean!
Katherine, the CRT (Andda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Yime V, Joel L, L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the whole executive (Gant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen W, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby).
Ab 'Angiosinin-consolting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in cells) in the lungs, muscles, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 combats angiotsin-consolting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and raising Ang (1.7) to make it a promising medicine for heart and blood. ACE2 also serves as a place to enter the cells of certain cornavirus.
A person’s type of enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Agiotsin-consoling enzyme 2 is metalloenzyme with zincs found in the face of endopressial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains N-terminal piptidase M2 as well as C-default colleclin renal amino acid transporter.
ACE2 is a single-type hydraulic protein I, whose enzymes operate in the face of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer core of the ACE2 cell is separated from the nucleus of the trinsmembrane by an enzyme known as shedase, and the weakened protein that occurs is removed from the blood and eventually results in the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body components: ACE2 is associated with the cell’s cells of the second type of cell in the alvelar, the thorroytes of small tubes, the arterial cells and the endocerial cells in most of the body.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, stritam, hypothalamus, and bainsteinm.
The primary work of ACE2 is to work as an ACE secretary.
ACE divides angiotsin I hormone into annotation genosin II.
ACE2 divides the carboxyl-terminal amino acid tangene from angiosin II (Asp-Arg-Arg-Tr-Tyr-Hi-H) and separates it as an oval-Arynin (1-7), (H-Asp-Ar-Tyr-H).
ACE2 can also distinguish several other pipides involving[des-Arg9], brandykin, apelin, neurotin, dyrphin A, and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the movement of the neutral acid acid crystalstraporter SLC6A19 and is included in Hartnup disease.
Like a trinsmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entrance to certain cornavirus cells, which include HCOV-NL63; SARS-CORV (SARS); and SARS-CV-2 (the virus causing COV-19).
Directly, the combination of the Spyke S1, SCOV and SARS-CV2 enzymes in the ACE2 enzyme on the surface of the cells results in the endocytosis and in the movement of both the virus and the enzymes to the endos.
This entering procedure has to make Sprotein function by synthesis TMPRS2, a preventive under current research as a cure for the disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 viruses, in cells, can help to fight the virus.
However, many prominent institutions and working organizations have encouraged continued with the normal ACE prevention and treatment of ARB.
"ACE preventive replacement and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "" use of ACE preventives was associated with a significant reduction of 34% of pneumonia risk compared with control."
"More than that," "the risk of pneumonia has been reduced to patients treated with ACE’s cesareantics who have been in high risk for pneumonia, especially those with heart disease."
"ACE prevention has also been linked to the reduction of patients who die from pneumonia, although the effects are less serious than the damage that pneumonia can cause."
ACE2 man’s combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new therapy for severe lung damage, and it seems to promote airborne hemodymics releases from the pigs with the opolysalaccid-ind accured factorate restractorys syndrome.
A half rhACE2 per person takes 10 hours to work and begins working after 30 minutes more than 24 hours (time).
According to one study, rhACE2 can be an appropriate drug for those who cannot drink the normal throughout-angietinic system (RAS inhitors), or disease during which angiotsinin II analyzes progress. The fulfillment of hrACE2 has been examined in medical research on the treatment of anti-spitalry syndrome.
"COVID 19" programs designed to help you find numbers regarding the 2019-20 Cornavirus epidemic, as a process of finding people ("onvirus") may have been contacted by the infected person.
Several programs have been developed or taken into consideration, in support of government law in some places.
Devices have been developed to build a search for the contact.
Confidential concerns have been expressed, especially with regard to frames based on the track of the applet users.
Other ways that do not require private information include the use of Bluetth guitars to replace the user’s role in other youths.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would build a way to support such claims in Bluetooth directly on the Androids and OS.
In China, the Chinese government is dealing with Alipay, has established an app that allows residents to check whether they have contacted people with COVID-19.
Used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a cap called TraceTgster is used.
"This application was developed by local IT staff, published as an open source and will be offered by the government. In North Macedonia the "Stop Korona" was released," "App works with Bluetooth to be followed by people who may have been infected and given prompt response to health authorities."
This application was introduced by the Institute of Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Starting on April 14, 2020, this map was expected to be authorized by the Google Plain and the Apple App Square.
"On 12 April, the government said that the search was at an advanced level of development, and it would be possible to obtain release from a few weeks. The same app is prepared in Ireland, and in France ("" "StopCovid")."
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the app based on the Singapore TraceTgster and Blue Trace protocol. Russia purposes to establish a model when man crosses the limits of the patients who have been found living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are not out of the home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of defense at Cambridge University, lists a number of factors that can be a problem with the app cells, including misleading warnings and opportunities for not getting a warning if a cap is limited to only a small number of people.
"In order to solve problems related to the progress of the "e-connavirus" advancing "extract or dangerous" applet, the Appnavirus" set limits to the types of organizations that can insert cornaviruss on its App Store, said it would be only those "law" or trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have developed similar boundaries.
Colonnavirus partners who fight secrecy have expressed their concern about the problems of mass detection using cornavirus caps, especially as to whether a search program designed to handle the cornavirus epidemic will be prevented when the damage has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a stamp that sets limits on this search.
These organizations have set up nine issues in government institutions:
"Request" should be "authorized, necessary and appropriate"
The analysis of the period of caution and search should have matters for the sun's sunset;
the use of the chart should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
protection of the sun and the unknown of names will need to be protected and shown as based on evidence;
self-conforming analysis will have to avoid reducing the evils of prejudice and reducing the value of things;
any fellowship with the rest of men shall be according to the law;
and must be careful against abuse and community rights to respond to abuse;
"to share in a useful way with all "awards" will be required, which includes the public health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (Reporter hynun) (RSF) also publish tests.
A proposed Google/Applet program intended to remedy the ongoing problem by removing search operations on the OS console where you are no longer needed.
Some countries that have used space exploration based on a network rather than app, which eliminates both the need to update the app and to avoid following.
In Israel, a network - based order was approved.
The solutions based on the network that can reach the global epidemic of unconstitutional sites can have serious secret problems.
However, not all sistrums have large servers to find their access to a man’s site; the number of hidden discs has been developed using large servers only for communication (see below).
In South Korea, non-app frames were used to be followed by a person.
Instead of using the chosen app, the stirm collects information to search through various sources that involve a series of new discs and credit cards, and includes this in order to send text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn people who may be infected, the government has also made community information available, which is permitted because of the many changes in the privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This knowledge is widely distributed to the public by app and satellites. The countries involved in Germany have considered using both large and secret elements.
Since 6, April 2020, details have not yet been published.
A system that protects secrecy is a well - designed method, with many research works that date back at least 2013. Since July 7, 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have sought solutions that accept secrecy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user with other youths.
PPP-PT, however, is an attempt to connect which contains both major and varied ways, and is not a single protocol. The various protocols include the Dentralized Privacy-PRing Protocols (DPT/DPPT-TTTT), Terorary Contacts (TCN, CCC, the FCCCCC), the Procatactictactory Protocol Protocol Protos and Men for Medicines (other).
Of these protocols, a man’s apparent drought never leaves a civilization, and all attempts to squeeze him into despair do.
The Provasive Group in Mmit Media Lab has always developed the Safety Paths, a platform for use of a system to protect privacy when storing it and using a limited area or network of track to follow the development of COVID-19.
"It is based on research from the white page" Aspps Gone Rogue: Mainenting Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. One similar effort is the Safertrace platform of the Enigma MPC, the company that was first developed in the MIT Media Lab. "
SafeTrace uses a protected tape to allow users to deal with the critical weather and health problems of other users and law officials, without risking the net's privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the international TCN Coalition was formed by groups associated with what had been the same method as the most diverse protocols, with the goal of reducing division, and allowed worldwide use of the transverse and warning, an important factor in widespread acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that he was making an invitation to the BlueTrace protocol used by its official statepp.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, firms controlling the young firms of Android and IOS, declared how to search people, and agreed to protect secrecy, based on the system of the Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography.
They also publish technical features used in the sistrum.
According to the Apple and Google, the centre is intended to be removed in three categories:
the removal of equipment to allow governments to construct the official App that controls the crossnavirus protection factor
to apply this feature directly to the system of IOS and Android Gogle and Apple to correct further problems of starting and continuing caution by sending a session with OS scans, and later removing it in the same way when the threat has passed.
The b 'Drug repositioning (also known as reuse of a tree, profiling, e-tasing, or metadding switching) is to reuse the prescribed medicine to treat another disease or a different health condition.
This is the kind of scientific research that is currently known to develop the safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research guidelines include the development of the COVID-19 goal and the transmission of the dialless plasma. The SARS-Cov-2 has about 6 proteins capable of taking the medicine, each with many of the multiple sections of the molecules.
The analysis of the links in which it is associated constitutes a rational plan to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important proteins in SARS-CoV-2 is a protein such as papalin, RNA polymerase based on RNA, helicase, S proteins, and ADP phosphatase.
Hussein A, and others have studied a number of medicines that can be used and analyzed the similarity of its structure with the same high - tech drugs to speed up the development of the powerful treatment of SARS-CV-2 on this premedical research.
Chloroquine is a respirator of malaria used in some forms of antibodies.
On March 18, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the combination medical research.
New York State commissioner Andrew Cuomo announced that a study of New York State of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on 24 March. On the day of March 8, FDA approved the use of hydroxychloquine sulfate and chloquine phospate under Emergeny Use Authority (UA).
This treatment is not yet authorized by the FDA research method and is recognized only under EUUA as a research method that will be used for emergency cases in hospital patients but cannot accept medical treatment.
"The CDC has said "" use, volume, or period of hydrogen chloroquine in prophylax or treatment of the SARS-CV-2" virus is not correct.
"Doctors say they use medicine when "there's no other way"."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study in using chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Extensive research continues at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NU Lane Medical School does research on the safety and operation of hydroxychloquine to prevent disease.
" Chinese medical research in Wuhan and Shenzhen says it appears to be favipilavir "actually useful." "
The 35 patients in Shenzen have been diagnosed with a stroke during 4 days, while the length of sickness was 11 days for 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half was given a favipilavir and one half was given mifenovir.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has introduced himself to Trump on the purchase of medicine. The medication may not work entirely in the worst conditions of illness where the virus has multiplied.
It may not be safe to use it in pregnant women or in trying to become pregnant.
"A further study of Elipavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of anti-injector and tritonavir drugs, concluded that "" has no value found." "
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from multiplying by contact with Proteas.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change drugs in order to find a solution to SARS-Cov-2. There are critics in the scientific community by directing efforts to renew drugs specially designed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO includes Elipavir/ritonavir in the United World Research.
Remdesivir was built and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. The Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had work to fight the virus against flo-, pneummo-, paraloyxo-, and corrona-.
One problem with antiviral treatment to develop multagion therapy can lead to the worst and most contagious disease.
Early research suggests that REMdesivir may have a high - tech immune system. There are a number of ongoing medical studies, including two of which are conducted at Cleveland Hospitals; one for those with moderate illnesses and one for the worst.
There are three subsequent medical researchs of vitamin C for hospital patients with CVOID-19; two drugs (in China, Canada) and one uninterrupted (in Italy).
New York State started a study of a chemical antibiotics on 24 March 2020.

A study of a number of 300 patients who studied the use of Nenoxapain sodium in the prevention and treatment of the disease was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-Cov-2 is a virus, science has concentrated on reuse of antibiotics that had previously been developed such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Rivarin: Arbanin was suggested to treat COVID-19 according to 7 Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: efenovir suggested to treat COVID-19 according to 7 Chinese guidelines
Other antibiotics that have been discovered as reuse in treating COVID-19:
Tolizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Official in China.
In studies also of Italy and China. See Tolizumab#COVID-19.
The goal of a "A COVID-19 is the proposed goal against corronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no goal has been reached at the end of medical research, there are many ongoing efforts to build such a goal.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would not have expected the goal of SARS-Cov-2, the virus, to be identified under 18 months.
The five davits of the Department of Security Research in April.
COVID-19 was adopted in December 2019.
The massive explosions increased worldwide in 2020, leading to a major financial and research project for the development of the goal.
Many organizations are using genes to establish goals that are not made by SARS-CV-2.
Starting in April, the key elements of CEPI project project are fast, refined, produced, and accessible to the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms had been studied and established in the early 1920 ’ s for a practical goal against COVID-19.
The activities of the large platform that advanced the safety research of Article I include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (born Article I and goal index: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Vial vorator (born Article I and goal index: Cannon Biologics, adevirus type 5 vocator)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the 15 seconds are in the original stages of development, and 78 are confirmed as pirogues (79, according to the Millennium Institute), and 37 are announced, but much less public knowledge is available (probably planned or invented).
Research of the IIII section examines safety before use and fighting against the virus, usually not planned, is controlled by the poison, and is in many institutions, while more accurate, effective levels are considered.
The study of Article III often involves more participants, which involves the control team, and the operation of a goal test to prevent disease, while the crucial results are paid for the proper amount.
"In the 79 Centrics of the goals established (e.g. at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not studied with the public (which had not been studied "" prior to the treatment"").
On the 24 January 2020 ’ s in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was doing research on whether the cause of molecular Clam would be used in the genes for treatment.

Others who are not financial partners of CEPI in establishing the goal of COVID-19 is Moderna, Curujac, Inovio, Novax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun studying animals with six different goals.
The Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20,20 that they developed the RNA goal of self-testing yourself of COVID-19.
This goal was established within 14 days of the discovery of the goal in China.
By the end of March, the Canadian government declared a $75 million to support 96 percent of the research projects in COVID-19, which involved several goals in Canadian companies and universities, such as activities in the Mediacago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$2 million specifically to establish the goal of COVID-19, with the development of "" goals" for the whole country of several new goals that can be used in the explosion of another corronavirus."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a Pittcovic survey, an unuse of COVID-19 on infants, also pointed out that the MNA goals of SARS-CV-2 S1 have to produce the effects of the active anti-infloor [int cells] that appear in 2 weeks after getting a goal."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterlolo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a goal based on DNA that could be a nuclear blow.
Using antibiotics used for treating, the DNA will be designed to develop among the human virus to produce harmless molecules such as bacteria, which may encourage immune systems to produce anti-SARS-CV-2 anti-SD.
In March 2020, the government, the government, the firms, and three U.S. universities combined equipment to get large IBM computers, combined with computer equipment from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals have the effect of other organisms, also called vague results.
That means they can have far more than the side effects of the illness that prevents them.
One informal study in Australia requires to register 4,170 health workers.
Goals may be set to safety or to work.
The first study of the goal is using the COVID-19 animal model, such as an ACE2 mosquito equipped with ACE2, other carboreter animals, and human predators, to illustrate the need for preventive protection against the 3 virus, and to cooperate with other countries to ensure the safety systems that work everywhere.
The goals of the SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
Since 2020, there has been no cure or protection goal of the SARS that has proved safe and effective to humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new goals and drugs in the treatment of the SARS was a major factor in government and public health services around the world. And there is no available goal of the MERS.
When the MERS accelerated, it was believed that existing SARS research would provide a useful information on the development of the MERS-CV virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one goal (the DNA) of MERS that completed a medical research class I, and the other three are still being studied, and all are goals for the blue-vectors, adenovial-vector (ChAx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-DA (MVAMMERSS).
The post offices promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already available.
The pendants quoted from the posts of various chat rooms refer to the already existing lines of genetics and the goals of other members of the cornavirus, such as SARS cornavirus.
The b virus of Coronnavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious virus caused by a servete respiry corrovirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and denial.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, nausea, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but can last from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result from symptoms, others result in increased pneumonia and the death of many organs.
Since April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is most widely spread among people who contact, usually by small doses that appear when coughing, coughing, or speaking.
Although these droplets appear when breathing, they usually fall to the ground or to other objects rather than become bacteria in long periods.
People may also be infected by affecting the infected area and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in some 72 hours.
It is more common during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it may develop before the symptoms of the disease and the later stages of the virus. The usual method of screening is the endor of the screen action (rRT-PCR) with the breast tube.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they have a virus and their caregivers.
The proposals for public use vary, some authorities say that it is not used, others say that it is not used, and others force it to be used.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against COVID-19 virus.
The spread of the virus has been found in many countries in all six locations of WHO.
Those infected may have no symptoms of disease or have symptoms such as fever, fever, fatigue, and denial.
Symptoms of an emergency include respiratory trouble, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty in wakes, and dry lips; immediate medical attention is encouraged when these symptoms appear.
Strange as it may seem, symptoms of breathing above such as nausea, nausea, or a sore throat may appear.
Symptoms of disease from the mouth to the knees as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed by various percent.
Some cases in China were first created only with chest stiffness and heart beating.
In some cases, disease can develop into pneumonia, killing many organs, and killing.
This is also called the period of diagnosis.
The period of symptoms of COVID-19 usually lasts from five to six days but can be from two to 14 days.
9.5% of people who have symptoms develop during the 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of those who have no symptoms in transmitting it to others is not fully known; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of people who are not yet exposed to the symptoms of disease is currently known and studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people in the hospital have always had no symptoms.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases of disease in its daily numbers on April 1; for 166 infected that day, 130 (78%) did not have symptoms during examination.
Both the ax and the saliva can carry the virus.
Uncontrolled speech produces a number of notes instead of general words.
A study in Singapore found that a dive without covering it would lead to about 4.5 feet [4.5 m] in diameter (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by breathing and that air-cushion containers outside the rooms of the people have removed the samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures such as the injection of a tube and cardiopilmonary resusion (CPR) may cause the production of crystals to be removed from the air and resulted in increased breathing.
Although there is concern about the spread of the disease, this risk is thought to be relatively small. The virus is very contagious when people have symptoms; although an increase may occur before symptoms appear, there is little danger.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while not fully explaining how easy it is for the virus to spread, one person usually infects two or three persons. The virus lives for hours to days in things.
In particular, it was found that the virus lives one day on board, about three days in plastic (polypropylene) and iron (Asi 304), and about four hours in 99% gas.
This, however, varies from moisture to heat.
A soap can also be effective if it is properly used; soap products reduce the protective layer of the parasite, kill it, and remove it from the skin and other areas.
Some soaps, such as balalconium chloride and chloxide gluconate (billoxide disinfectant for surgery), do not work properly. In Hong Kong research, saliva samples were taken two days after first being hospitalized.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed the high level of the virus, and a sixth patient showed the high level of the virus on the second day under consideration.
Severe for the spapolitory cornavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most severe cause for the problem of the spasterry syndrome, starting with the release of three cancers in Wunhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 are derived from cornavirus.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by the house’s soap, which explodes its protective shell. SARS-CV-2 is closely related to SARS-CV.
The lungs are most sensitive to COVID-19 because the virus enters the primary cells called angiantin-consoling enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in the majority of the second type of alveor cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called "" spapike" (peplor) to communicate with ACE2 and enter the primary cell.
The worst heart injury was found in 12% of the people who have been admitted to a hospital in Wunhan, China, and are more likely to develop serious illnesses.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms, causing stroke and antibodies during the outbreak of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are very visible in the heart and are involved in heart activity.
The case of arthritis (31%) andvenous throboelism (25%) is found in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus and may be related to weak prognosis. The research of people killed by COVID-19 has shown fuse alveorgige (DAD), and the severity of lymphocyte in the lungs.
Although the SARS-COV-2 has an ACE2-expressing epithelial respiratory activity, patients with sensitive COVID-19 have symptoms of Systemic hyperimalmation.
Specially, the parthogenic GM-CSF-secting T-cells appear to correspond to the discovery of IL-6-crecting monoytes and the causes of bad lung infections in COVID-19 patients.
It has also been reported that lymphocytics inftrates have been examined.
WHO has published a number of microscriptions for testing the virus.
The usual method of testing is the everyone directly related to the process of reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests are often conducted on respiratory samples found in the spinal tube; however, a nose tube or a captuum sample can also be used.
The results are usually found after a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken during the two weeks and the results have less importance at the time.
Chinese scientists have been able to divide part of the corronavirus and to print the sequence of elements so that labrethris around the world can develop for themselves a polymerase lain reaction (PCR) to identify the virus with the disease.
Since April 4, 2020, the study of immunological agents (which may find effective pathogens and if a person has already developed a virus) has been developed, but not widely used.
Chinese studies show that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first study of treatment on March 21,20, which was used at the end of that month. The research guidelines published by the Zongnan Hospital of Wunhan University suggested ways of detecting the virus based on the medical aspects and risk of disease control.
Submarines are spread by peripheral, asymmetric and poststerioor, which are common in infection.
Subplulal dominance, crazy pasing (a low-platial fever), and Consolation may develop as the disease progresses.
The small net available for microscopic tests and microphysiology of COVID-19.
The main causes were identified in the study:
macroscopy:uleurisy, perricarddistis, lung consolation and plmonary idema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be identified:
normal pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneummyte hypoplasia, algentic pneumonics, interstitial inflammatory inflammatory behavior, and multinical depression
critical pneumonia: diffuse alvelar gege (DAD) and diffuse alvelar toxites.
DAD is the cause of arcoles syndrome (ARDS) and Severe hypoxemia.
Contamination hormone: a mixture of equidites to alvelar carvities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Distincted diaphrascular coagulator (DIC); leukuerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, getting used to clean your mouth and nose, and avoiding eye contact, nose, or mouthless hands.
The CDC encourages shutting off the mouth and nose with your nose when coughing or yawing and encourages using the inside of the snail when the noise is missing.
Proper washing of hands after coughing or yawning is encouraged.
The CDC promotes the use of a mask cloth while in public, in part to reduce infection from people who do not have HIV symptoms. Social networks are intended to limit contact with infected people and large groups by closing schools and services, preventing travel and exposing large gatherings.
The regulations of isolation also include that people live at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known drug that works in preventing COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 2201 at least, the best way to control COVID-19 is to try to reduce the number of those infected, which is called "" to make the line flat."
The CDC also encourages regular washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands seem dirty, before eating, and after a sneezing, coughing, and yawting.
It also encourages the use of a handy press at least 60% of alcohol, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In areas where hand-tills are not readily available, WHO provides two ways to produce them in the area.
In these ways, the work of an antimicrobial comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
"hydrogen peroxide is used to help finish bacteria from alcohol; "It's not the virus on hand washing"."
glycerol is inserted to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid treatment, oxygen supply, and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected of infected wear normal facial masks.
Extracroral membrane perigene peripheration (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of breathing, but its benefits are still considered.
Cleanliness, life, and healthful food have been promoted so that you do not become infected.
The medical methods that support the body can help those with non-inflammatory symptoms recently infected. WHO and China National Health Commission have published suggestions for caring for patients in a hospital with COVID-19.
Intensilivists and U.S. pulmonologists combined treatment methods from various units on the free source, IBCC.
Since April 2020, there has been no treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors encourage paracetamol (Acetaminophen) instead of ubprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to one another, especially in medical facilities where procedures are made that may produce aerosols, such as a combination or hantification.
For physicians caring for COVID-19, the CDC encourages keeping a person in the Airborne Instruion Rome (AIIR) rather than using the usual steps, preventing contact and diarrhea. The CDC defines the guidelines for the use of prehuman proptactication (PE) during the epidemic.
The required items: PPE team, facial refraction, eye protection, and doctor's flags. When available, therespirators (in place of eye masks) are encouraged.
The N95 respitors are authorized to be used in factories, but FDA allows the Maamasski to be used under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are designed to protect themselves from air particles as dust, but the protection of a unit of a particular body is not guaranteed in its use.
If computers are not available, the CDC suggests using siereds or, if none else, automated tiles.
Most COVID-19 conditions are not too bad to require mechanical vestation or other means, but some need it.
The type of respiratory support associated with COVID-19 is still being studied by hospital personnel, and there is some evidence that the anti-inflammation can be avoided by the high light canal casal cannucula or bi-levated gasypressure.
Whether these two factors lead to the same outcome is unknown to those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer to have invasive mechanical vutilation if available because this method reduces the spread of the particles that are released when compared with the high frow and salcan cannnu. The worst conditions are common among adults (more than 60 years of age, especially over 80).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduce the number of people raised to the failure to cope with the unexpected increase in the number of people with COVID-19 who need hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were placed in a place of ill-being, 2.3% needed help with the Vütilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of patients in COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Ventilation machines become more complicated as the actate respiratory system (ARDS) is developed in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
High levels of stress control and PEP are required to increase air supply while reducing the risk of lung damage related to shoulder and pneutorex.
PEP may not be found in old docklerators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and several antibiotics against the virus are medical research.
remdesivir seems to be the most effective one.
While 2021 can still be developed, a number of new medicines being tested have already been approved for another use or progress in testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried by people who have a serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to take part in the research and safety of drugs that can be used for medical treatment. FDA has temporarily recognized the dialless plasma as a clinical therapy in situations where man has been affected by bad conditions.
They have not entered the medical field to ensure that they are safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a mobile device device was started in China.
Users are asked to enter the name and number ID ID.
This applet can see ‘ if you are close to a person' using a search net that can be dangerous to infection.
All users can look at the situation of three other users.
When a potentially dangerous situation appears, app not only encourages isolation, but also cautions the health authorities. The analysis of a vast network with a youth's age, face - to - face technology, youth telephone, and established knowledge is used to transport infected and infected persons in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized the security lines to follow the age of supposed corronavirus.
This is done to separate them from the community and to protect those who may be infected with the infected population.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telom shared a local telephone network with the German government government, Robert Koch Institute, to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed face - to - face technology to find out who violates the laws of social isolation.
"The Italian public health officer Giulio Galrera said it was told by young workers that ""40% of people continue to walk."
The German government has run an eight - hour computer race on the weekend of 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a national declaration of solutions to the development of corronavirus.
People may face the stresses of isolation, restricted travel, poor medical conditions, or fear of getting infected by the virus itself.
"BC has been quoted by Roy O’Connor that, "The continued social isolation, loneliness, concern for health, depression and economic collapse is a storm that harms people’s mind and well-being."
The virus may have a few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory infections above it as common flu.
Common cases have been cured during two weeks, while those infected with a serious or harmful virus can take from three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be more vulnerable to the dangerous COVID-19 on the basis of the plague from other same microbes, such as SARS and MERS, but the COVID-19 epidemic is lacking. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are particularly affected, COVID-19 may quickly develop into a cessation disorder disorder (ARDS) causing damage in breathing, saptic rock or killing many organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include seps, abnormalcting and heart damage, kidneys and liver.
[Cloting nonmarritities], particularly the increase of prothrombibin time, is found in 6% of those admitted in the hospital for COVID-19, while poor kidney function is seen in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show high levels of courage (transminances).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, ICU patients have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the study of earlier cases, the average time from the appearance of the first symptoms of disease to death was 14 days, a total of six to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% while the mortality rate for women is 1.7%.
Hestopathograms are samples for the examination of body lungs that show feverous alverar gege and celsular fibmyxoid in both lungs.
The change of vittopathic changes was seen in pneumytes.
The pope’s photo showed the arcoperary system syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted for the higher levels of nitrogen or heart shape.
According to the March Calendar from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospital care were already sick. The availability of medical and economic factors and the community may contribute to the deaths of people.
The death toll from the virus varies as a result of that diversity in the region, but also because of difficulties in the methods used.
Few of the worst conditions can make the death toll more than expected.
However, the fact that death is the consequence of the previous outbreaks of the virus may not mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smoking users have 1.4 times more likely to get symptoms of COVID-19 and have more than two.4 times more chance of receiving care for an emergency or death in comparison with nonsmokers. Concerns have been expressed about long before the virus.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a 20% to 30% decrease in the activity of other infected people, and lung tubes that indicate that it may be damaged.
This can also lead to postpartum depression after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could help to provide effective and long - term protection for the people who recover from the virus.
Defense against the virus seems to be possible, based on other corronaviruss, but there have been reported cases in which recovery of COVID-19 has been followed by a thorough examination of cornavirus later.
These conditions are thought to be the spread of the virus, not the next infection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and from an animal, and it then infects humans.
The exact origin is not known, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was probably entirely guided by its transmission from one person to another.
A study of the first 41 established cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in Lancet, indicated that the first day of the outbreak of the disease was December 1, 2019.
The WHO official documents reported that the symptoms of the first disease actually occurred on December 8, 2019.
Several methods of counting the dead are widely used.
These figures vary from read to reading and from time to time and depending on the level of diagnosis, medical doses, treatment, time from the first phases and characteristics of people, such as age, sex, and health.
In the late 1920 ’ s, WHO assigned emergency cases at ICD-10, U07.1 killed by a hard-CoV-2 rub virus and the U07-2 which was killed by the COV-19 treated COV-19 treated by physicians and screening without the guaranteed SARS-CV-2 virus virus. The death rate shows the number of those who die from the virus is separated by the number of those who have been infected during the given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate above the global virus is 6.9% (153,822/2,294,191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other ways include caratality rate (CFR), showing the percentage of infected agents, and infertity rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of people infected with the virus (infR) who are infected with the virus.
These statistics are not based on time and follow a number of individuals from infection to the solution of the situation.
While not all who are infected with the disease are immune to the immune system, the presence of disease - causing agents can provide information about how many people are infected.
In the area where most people are infected in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80% are already dead.
In the Ganges, the virus was developed in the Carnival meetings, and it entered into youths, causing lower mortality rates, and not all victims of COVID-19 were officially recognized as infected.
In addition, the German health clinic has not yet had large numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors are tested.
The 69 (0.004% of the population) are confirmed that they are killed by COVID-19.
An outbreak of epidemic and mortality differs from men and women.
Death rates are higher for men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest danger for men when they are 50, and the gap between men and women is restricted only in 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent of men and 1.7 percent of women.
The main reasons for these differences are not known, but genetic factors and behavior may be the cause.
The contrast between the sexually transmitted virus, the low rate of smoking in women as well as in men who have other illnesses such as hypertension at an early age can contribute to the high mortality rate of men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are male, and 72% of those killed by COVID 19 were males.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not follow the sex - related plague of COVID-19.
Studies indicate that increased diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high number of health - care workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have many opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus would be "COVID-19". "
WHO prime minister Terros Adana Ghereyes explained that CO represents corona, VI representing virus, D represents diasese, and 19 refers to the year of the first eruption: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen so that it would not be named after a specific area (such as China), animal species or group of people, according to the suggestions of various countries to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a serrete corrotory syndrome 2 (SARS-CV-2).
"WH also uses "COVID-19" and "" "the" virus that causes COVID-19" in public conversations."
" Both disease and infection are often called "" cornavirus."
"Among the first outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "" corronavirus" and "the" of Wuhan. "
In January 2020, WHO suggested 2019-nCov and 2019 accote respirotory disease as names to be used for the virus and disease in accordance with 2010 guidelines against the use of places in terms of disease and infections.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Because of the shortage of products in the industry, some electronic producers produce such medical products as detergents and parts of dolphins.
For example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed a Ventilator valve, and the surgeon was unable to send it at the time it was required, the local company used its equipment and printed 100 valves that were needed in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, imaginary stories, false and misleading stories came up as to the origin, development, prevention, prevention, treatment, and other side effects of the disease and spread rapidly over the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the presence of pigs, ducks, and chickens in a virus.
There is no known cure for the disease or the ultimate goal of treating it.
International research on the goal and medications of COVID 19 is conducted by government agencies, school teams, and industrial researchers.
"On March, the World Health Organization began the "VESTICATION" to evaluate the effects of four vaccines against the existing virus with high hopes for action."
There is no vaccine available, but various geronts work to develop vaccines.
The previous work of SARS-Cov is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three methods of dating are being studied.
First of all, researchers are intent on developing an antibacterial vaccine.
The purpose of the use of such a virus as this, inactive or dead, is to develop a body reaction against the new COVID-19 virus.
The second option, the subanit vaccines, is to establish a goal that enables the immune system to react to certain side effects of the virus.
If SARS-Cov-2, such research focuses on S-Spike protein that helps the virus enter ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is Nucleic acid goals (DNA goals or RNA goals, a new method of constructing a goal).
The goals studied in any of these methods should be tested for safety and operation. On 16 March 2020, the first study of the treatment of this goal began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal is to contain a free genetic code that is copied into the disease - causing virus. The development of disease - based development has been proposed as a challenge to the development of SARS-COV-2, but this is not guaranteed.
There are more than 300 medical studies continuing since April 2020.
The seven studies examined the already authorized treatment of malaria, which includes the fourth study of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reincarnation drugs make up much of the study in China, and the nine study of the Imdesivir class in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
A strong medical replacement for the development of COVID-19 and non-encancer drugs had begun, in April 2020. Several vaccines available against the virus are being studied in the treatment of COVID-19, involving remediviriririr, chloroquine and hydrologine hyxychloroquine,loquine and lepár/tinator/tinavirorinar.
There was physical evidence for the remdesivir operation, in March 2020.
It is evident that progress in the treatment of patients that has been seen in the use of sufficient remdesivir.
Medical research for the Article III is carried out in US, China and Italy. The chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, the results of research are proposed.
The health authorities of Korea and China encourage the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although promoting a one - pound daily volume, notes that twice that amount is too high and can kill.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to be used in emergency circumstances for the hydroxychlororine and chloquine by the observation of COVID-19 medical doctors. The seven Chinese programmes included interferon, bribanin or mifenovir treatment for COVID-19.
An unregister indicates that high corbanin levels are required to prevent SARS-Cov-2 from in vitro.
Atoxanide has been suggested in ongoing vitrovide research after showing the weakness of SARS-CoV-2. Research shows that the first rise of protein priming with trisming proteins 2 (TMPRS2) is crucial to the entrance of SARS-CV-2 by contact with ACE2.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychlorroquine is as well as azithroycin or without it has large restrictions that have protected the medical community from getting the treatment without continued research. Oselmitivir does not prevent SARS-Cov-CV-2 from vitrorotro. and has an unknown role in treating COVD-19.
The Cytokines starm can be a problem in later COVID-19's worst divisions.
There is evidence that hydroxychlororoquine can have non-cytokines storm. Tolizuab has been added to medical guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a partial study.
A study of paragraph 2 in Italy was conducted that was not intended for the national sector after showing significant consequences to people with a serious illness.
It is combined with a blood test of serum ferritin to find cytokines, intended to prevent this, which is thought to be the cause of certain deaths.
Interleukin-6 receptor noncongost was approved by FDA based on previous research in treating multiple bloodsterrophy cytokine syndrome, CAR T, in 2017.
So far, there is no indirect, controlled evidence thattolizumab is a successful cure for CFS.
The transmission of cleansed and powerful antibodies produced by the immune system of those who are recovering from COVID-19 on people who need it is sought as a means that they don't need to limit the amount of protection.
This method was tried in the SARS and the results were unknown.
Randal andutilation is the most expected way to be used when insufficient medical treatment can create protection against SARS-CV-2.
However, some methods, such as cellular cytoxicity based on the structure of the disease as well as/or paragocytos, may be possible.
Other therapies for the immune system, for example, are being developed by the same cells.
The production of divaralent serum, which contains a blood component from healthy patients and has antibodies related to the virus, can be developed to speed up.
Cronavirus diseases, a group of closely associated diseases
Li Wenling, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wunhan, who later became infected and died as a result of COVID-19 after helping in the diagnosis of infection.
