You have to be there to bring it.
Why do you feel that way at home?
Father and father.
Do not give up.
I am new here.
I don’t think so.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why do we not do so?
We shall see each other again!
Speak With Your Neighbor, 6 / 15
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
Last year, I gave birth to my first child.
I know what it means to see her again.
You are a good person.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Better it would be if you did not leave.
I am not hungry.
I am a senior student at a university.
I lost my means of communication.
We are not alone.
I want you to know.
What are the benefits?
Everyone knew what to do.
It made me think about you.
I am one of your classmates.
Why not learn French?
Not as you might think.
I don’t want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When does he rise?
Do Tom know why?
What is my hour?
We have no money.
Forgive me! ’
I do not need them.
I talked to my parents about everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know who he is.
Yes, indeed.
When it’s not just cold, it laughs too much.
I lost my pencil.
When Do You Arise?
You can find all that is available to you.
He made all the noise.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Are you coming, or are you going to?
I want to protect it.
Would you like to make a living?
I don’t have any headaches.
If you do not hear, they will come.
He is my father.
That’s what I want to know.
What has he not understood?
I don’t think she came.
I couldn’t believe my ears.
They said that he was a very wealthy man.
His words were striking.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows but his parents well.
I was able to do it.
I don’t think she came.
He did.
The sun shines directly overhead.
Why not?
It will be wonderful.
It’s normal.
I remember that age.
Would you like to take it?
Does he even care about you?
I wish I had said so.
My brother was not at home.
My parents were very strict with me.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
Look at the picture.
I’m in a car.
What Can You Do?
Is this your mother?
Why does the heavens look like blue?
If you don’t, come.
This car is our home.
No one here has a car.
Choose for Us!
I don’t know.
You are not alone.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you looking for them?
By no means!
What is the purpose of this event?
They don’t give me a privilege.
My daughter will be married in six months.
I know these women.
I understand.
It makes me feel good.
Where do you know my name?
Would you like it?
What is love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I heard that you were married.
Is it yours?
In the past, he was a teacher.
Thank you.
I was lost!
Who do you think I am?
I can see that from my heart.
You want to see them.
Vows are made voluntarily, of one’s own free will.
He is not with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
Everyone is listening.
I thought it was your fault.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
Would you not agree?
And he did!
Take your time.
I do not know how long the delay will continue.
Whose designs is this?
By the way, how are you doing?
Yes!
Everyone knows what needs to be done.
Do not scrimp on the ground.
I’ll have to ask him.
We returned.
I’ll look at you.
I know a lot about you.
It’s normal.
I want to learn French.
My car is empty.
You know I have affection for you.
I know.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is happening.
He lost his car key.
Why don’t you go to my room?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate the sheep from the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I’m taking you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Were you satisfied?
Would I ever be able to return?
That is why I love you.
Are you one of them?
There will be an interval of time.
Please, separate from me.
For one thing, there is the capacity for spirituality.
It is extremely harsh.
You know I have affection for you.
The bed is very hot.
Our visit leaves early.
I accepted the offer.
What do you want to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you new?
I know what to do.
Do you like learning?
Do you have any money for me?
I don’t know how.
I know how to do it.
What are these?
I’m glad you are there.
This publication is not for sale.
Thank you for killing us.
I respect them.
Absolutely!
He is strong.
It cost five dollars.
I returned to my mother’s house.
It is perfect.
Yours is no respecter of persons.
I am sick.
Thanks for prompt action.
Do you like learning?
I will give it to you.
Let us eat and drink.
I want it out of my heart.
You are my friend.
Where is our car?
Everyone knows what needs to be done.
What school do you attend?
You don’t want to know!
He is a good student.
He makes me think.
Get a copy of the book and read it.
I am not at home.
Thank you very much.
I know you.
I think about it.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
I don’t know.
Do not be like that.
I thought you would be back in the dark.
My daughter is going to be married to a number of times.
He was raised by his grandmother.
Leave it alone.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have one brother.
I did it out of kindness.
How long do you want to keep it?
Every morning I leave home before two o’clock.
I lost my sight.
Why?
What is love?
We can understand.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are my dear wife.
I’ll like that.
It is ours.
Where Is Your Family Heading?
Stop saying the word.
Please, separate from me.
Where are we going?
I don’t know how.
You know where I shall be.
What is the purpose of your trip?
We are happy to see them.
I know the girl.
Stop the car.
I don’t understand.
Do you know what to do?
We know.
No, you definitely should not.
Where do you want to live?
I love where I live.
Do not doubt.
Do I have to open the window?
Blowing down a few drops of rain.
Where are you going?
Do not lose your joy.
You have to go home.
Will he be here?
Are you learning French?
You will be deeply repentant.
Visiting me.
Where am I driving?
I don’t know how.
There I met my brother.
I know what I am doing.
I gave him a book.
Who is your teacher?
I do it.
This girl wears as a boy.
I don’t have a brother.
Sadly, when my best friend moved away, he moved to another town.
Do they belong to you?
You know I have to be there.
That is your book.
It’s not my day.
How long has he been sick?
If he stayed home that day, he would be safe.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I’m not happy.
I know what is happening.
I know you know.
Better, would that not be?
I know what you think.
He is jealous.
So I had to change it myself.
Better it would be if you did not leave.
This girl wears as a boy.
I love to.
I have to prepare my hair.
Too little?
One thing is my brother.
I am happy and full of joy.
Do you have time to help me?
Give her.
I don’t know what to say.
Do you know what love is?
The marriage takes place on the sixth day.
I would not die.
Tell me about your determination.
Which publication is on the table?
I lost my pencil.
Thank you for coming.
I am a watchman.
Someone is standing after the wall.
I dropped out of school.
Yes.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
Are you a good musician?
When I jump to the top, I have to jump off the cliff.
Is he even there?
We did.
They are children.
Don’t be afraid, Tom.
Do not forget to send a letter.
I know he loves me.
There is a way to do this.
I too am going to school here.
I don’t have a brother.
I just moved on to the dock.
What Do You Think?
It’s a shame.
Where do you know?
Who is your father?
Don’t ask me about it again.
Dad is at home.
The height.
Are these Japanese?
Give me a book.
You are a good person.
The windows overlooked the south.
They were about to buy bread.
I will walk on the day of God.
We see it.
Where do you come from?
We’re here to stay.
I don’t know where he lives.
There is a hundred people in the home.
I’m not sure.
Falcons have no teeth.
Not really.
My dreams came true.
You can get to know me personally.
I don’t know what to say...
Where do you know?
I am not a college student.
Let me see.
Are you with us?
Do good to those who hate you.
There is no such thing as it was.
Too little.
The Daystar has already risen.
We are so happy.
She is beautiful.
Come home to visit me.
I’m not a good carpenter.
I don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I thought you would be back in the dark.
I did it for you.
I love your car.
Who is your teacher?
Do You Recall?
Does it interest you?
They do.
Undoubtedly.
Did I like that?
I’m not sure.
I’m glad you are there.
I need help.
I decided to quit.
Do not make mistakes, and you may find other ways to simplify your lifestyle.
I don’t know what to think about.
I don’t know what to do.
What motivates people to do so?
Where am I going?
Do you know his name?
Money spent.
I want to pay for my car.
I want to go too.
It’s just not fair.
What is your watch?
We could not believe it.
Stay there!
I lost my means of communication.
I don’t understand this.
I don’t know what it is like to be there today.
I’m looking for you.
You see, this house is my home.
Your car is pleasing to me.
They said that he was a very wealthy man.
He does not know.
Are you walking or not?
We do not go along.
A former temple is here.
I know you.
Oh, yes.
Why don’t you go home?
Is that how you feel?
They don’t give me a privilege.
What do you want to see?
Why do you ask?
And he did!
It’s not that I feel good about work.
I am convinced that it really is.
Get what you want.
I know her.
He did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your homework.
I want to accompany you.
I know only his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will refresh you.
We understand that.
What is the situation with the family?
I speak a little Spanish.
Come on!
How old is he?
I need to know why.
You are not related to me.
My family is small.
Do Tom know why?
Is he at home?
I love numbers.
I know how to do it.
There is no such thing as it was.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
Ah, here we are.
Where Is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where have you been?
I don’t know much French.
When do you travel?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
Is the phone number correct?
Be reasonable.
It’s not an animal.
Let me see!
Sooner or later it will.
Let them see.
Is travel worth all the effort?
I don’t know what it is like to be there today.
He shook his head.
Are you with us?
It is not a matter of boasting.
_Speed!
I love the car.
I know where I should be headed.
Yours is the same as yours.
How many are bought?
Leadership of the highest quality.
Not out of the way!
Where do you want to live?
Look.
I listened breathlessly.
Do not forget to send a letter.
We are here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes.
They know us.
When Do You Arise?
I do not give up.
From England.
I wish I had said so.
Let me explain.
The windows open.
You do not have to come.
Everyone is listening.
I have never forgotten them.
I don’t think she came.
It’s normal.
A sponge is a symbol of this.
I know how to do it.
Not one of them asked.
They want us to do so.
What do you see outside the house?
I’m glad you are.
I shall lack nothing.
Where Is Tom?
What is French?
My sister is one of these.
From the next day, we might be on the move.
We arrived.
I study French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they are going.
It is a miracle book.
Our weapons are powerful.
I know your father.
I learned French in school.
You have to go home.
Where have all the people gone?
Can you open a window?
Will you go there?
Who is my mother?
If not, when?
Is that what you are seeking?
Where Is Your Car?
My father was not at home.
There is no question about it.
Did you know?
Not at all.
Are you looking for them here?
There are no rich people here.
In the corner is a hole on the back.
He knows her.
I’m happy to see her.
My father was not at home.
Of course!
Is this a suitable phone call?
You can sing a song.
Empathize!
I know how to do it very well.
We’re not hungry.
I thought you could understand it.
Where are we going?
Love is withering.
Let me explain.
I know.
I am not a student.
I’ll try it.
The strong winds speed up, and I cannot move faster.
Probably not.
I saw one of my sisters.
I did not give up.
How much time will you spend on it?
Asa and his Father.
What are these?
You are born with it.
My house is next to the place of worship.
Wrong!
All falls on the ground will be eaten by the pigs.
I couldn’t look.
I don’t want to read them.
Everyone knows his name.
Do you know where they are?
Where do you go for education?
Where are you?
What a thought!
She did.
I never saw him.
Which ones does she keep?
Listen.
Why do people say that?
The past is of immense value.
I have vowed.
I don’t understand French.
There is no one!
Why do I have to do it?
It is Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a watchman.
How many?
We have no money.
I know you listen.
Check your shoes.
I know what you look like.
I am happy.
Is this car a new one?
Why not?
He did not read this book.
I do not want to be rich.
You just let me know I said it.
A corpse of mine [“my killed ones, ” ftn.] — they will rise up.
This will be delightful.
You can attend.
When do you come home?
He did not read this book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This publication is not for sale.
He knows her.
He is a Frenchman.
I don’t have a car.
Take care of your own health.
Why not make your point?
I want him to see you.
You can use this car.
He does not know.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Imagine that!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought her eggs and her milk.
One piece of paper was missing.
I saw him again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was your resolve?
Are you looking for them?
I’ll be in my car.
I do not like running.
He is a Frenchman.
He is the oldest son.
I know what they are.
You know how to do it very well.
I have a car.
When will you be home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 6: 00 a.m., it is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You have to stop drinking.
Look at your mother.
There is a way to do this.
Where did you stop the car?
Move between one and two o'clock.
If you have a sharp burst of anger, cut it off.
Should I Wear a T - shirt or tie?
What Is a Book?
Are they Americans?
What is it like?
Let me see!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not at all.
Let us find out.
What are your belongings?
The error?
I don’t smoke.
And he did!
I’ll Never Let You Down
I’ll take care of you.
We are happy.
Keep the environment quiet and calm.
They don’t respect me.
I take them.
I am not hungry.
I’m not sure.
Not necessarily.
I learned French in school.
Why?
I want you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do you want me?
Put yourself in your mother’s place.
You know I have to be there.
Which car?
Do you love him?
We have to set a scale between output and input.
The snake hits the target.
They do not ask today.
Do you know what you are asking?
Open the window!
May that be our home!
The boy is his younger brother.
Why don’t you go to school?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I get in?
You know I have affection for you.
Researchers appear on the human bones in a prayer.
Our visit depends on time.
Can I see it again?
These steps may prevent the passage of time from being distracted.
I’m a refrigerator.
We are told to eat at least one meal together at a time.
Do not be angry!
This is not the conversation address. We only go to the movie.
I liked her.
Why are we not at home?
Leave my room!
I am new here.
I want to learn French.
I’ll take you.
I have no sister.
I sleep a lot.
I have a good job.
The water is very, very cold.
If I had known it, I would have walked away.
I’m talking about what I’m thinking.
What price?
I know where we are.
Why not?
I am about to get my car.
Why are you not in school?
We are students at a university.
I don’t know his name.
I shall lack nothing.
How do you go to school?
Forgive me! ’
Religion.
Do not hold back!
Do you know what it is?
You just let me know I said it.
I know her family.
I know what happens.
I lost my means of communication.
I accept this.
They don’t give me a privilege.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
I lost some of my eggs the next day.
Yes, it is.
You know.
I want to get some rest.
Not one of them asked.
We’re not hungry.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I wake up one hour a week.
Do not open the window.
Your house is abandoned to you.
Why don’t you?
Why the hot sun?
All days of work go by without it rain.
It is ours.
Let us look at it below.
How does your sister feel?
Can we talk?
Where are you taking us?
I liked the car.
Why Do You Learn French?
I think so.
I saw them.
I know who you are.
He accused the man of stealing.
I did this right away.
I never heard from him again.
I don’t know their names.
Talk about your goal.
I know what to do.
They said that he was a very wealthy man.
Yours is no respecter of persons.
In Germany, is it not?
Do you?
"What are these trucks like?" – "The same is Father."
You don’t have to thank me.
What happened next in the evening?
We want them to carry it.
Asa and his mother.
Since we are alone, let us enjoy it.
We came to see you.
Would you like it?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want to drink?
Do you not know what happened, or do you?
I know what love is.
Not at all.
The ostrich walks away.
What do you do here?
I’m a refrigerator.
She is happy to prepare.
We study in one class.
What was that?
It made me think about you.
Do you have rice?
Will he be here?
We shall see.
They are part of our family.
I know why you are here.
Why do you study at a university?
Which ones does she keep?
Sooner or later it will happen.
When are you going?
I've got back here.
It’s too provocative.
Listen to your mother!
Read what these people have to say.
I will give it to you.
What information?
Look inside my room!
What is this?
Do you want to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is lost?
I would like to read this book.
From Brazil.
I’ll take you home.
We study in one class.
Do not forget us!
I’m writing about it.
Avoid unnecessary contact.
Do you have this money?
Very little.
It is his work.
That is what you asked.
She’s my sister.
What are you looking for?
Buy?
He did.
I want to see it.
Stop making rules here!
Sometimes we go to the movies.
Do you not agree?
Have you read the book?
Where are we going?
Why do we do so?
These are extremely long.
Do you believe that he does not matter to me?
The skin is made up of dust.
She’s my sister.
It is his work.
Do you know what that was?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
An American?
A cow or a pear?
What is at the bottom of the list?
I’m sorry to say that.
We are on our own.
I love what I do.
My voice snags away from me.
Do you know what he said?
His word was perfect.
When would you like to travel?
I don't understand such things.
Is that the best?
Are they also in Japan?
I’ll try it.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing valuable time.
Why do you not give up?
Start a talk that is appropriate in other languages.
What is his family?
Magdalena and Ania are close friends.
I am happy and full of joy.
We should try to eat at least one meal together.
One thing is certain.
Do you have a brother?
We got on well.
I’ll agree with that.
I have to think about that.
Where is Mary?
I am lost.
I have to finish.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think you were happy?
Why don’t you go too far?
All are at home.
I immediately responded.
She loved him.
She was pregnant.
Why don’t they like me?
How large is the factory?
What did you give me?
Get out.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
Not really.
Coming!
I’m going to do it.
How many evenings?
We will do so.
I even greeted her.
You have to go home.
Asa and his Father.
You are directed to go along.
Do you know where he lives?
It didn’t interest me.
Why don’t you go with me?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
This is a very good report.
I thought you would be back in the dark.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
Names have been changed.
Can You Do It?
I miss them very much.
Do you know who they were?
What is this gate?
Why do I do it?
I’m not sure.
This utility works with automated devices.
I am not a student.
That is understandable.
Do not do that again.
Close window.
It didn’t interest me.
One piece of paper was missing.
Donations of cash with the condition that it can be returned if needed by the donor.
He is happy.
It’s out in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to take that?
Remember your kindness, especially if you have lost it.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We would like to give talks in the language.
So why have you come here?
I’m not sure.
A study was started with me.
Everyone said a word.
They are part of our family.
It is extremely harsh.
So I did that.
I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
It looks at him.
Do You Have cause for Rejoicing?
Autumn.
What was your resolve?
I no longer have any client.
We are students at a university.
It is not new.
Right or Wrong?
Can you not recognize that the fulfillment of this prophecy has intensified?
He could not believe his eyes.
I’ll try it.
Would you like to ask?
I know her.
What kinds of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where are you cared for?
It’s normal.
It’s good to see you.
How many cups have you enjoyed?
What is this office?
This car is very good.
We hear.
Our bicycles were exhausted.
We shall see.
Your personal information?
I know.
I’m sorry to say that.
Children.
I am a teacher.
We made our way down a mountain.
I can’t remember any names.
You want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I never smiled.
I am a student at a university.
These publications are available to us.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You came upon a red flash.
I know what I have been taught to learn.
I miss you very much.
I understand.
I want you to stay.
We all come together.
Give an opportunity.
I am not strong in these respects.
There is no one!
It is not a matter of rejoicing.
Do you understand French?
I tend to think.
For one thing, there is the capacity for spirituality.
Who is this wine?
I have one brother.
It is not a matter of time.
When you need help, you reach for it.
I too.
We left.
Here they are not wealthy.
Why?
Listen to your mother!
I love numbers.
And he did!
We all go together.
We will return the next week.
I like the way you look.
What do you do?
It’s a life - and - death matter.
Were they also coming?
You know that we love you.
You can separate sheep from goats.
I’ll think about that.
I listened breathlessly.
I love to learn French.
Maybe we can take us to the beach at the end of the seventh.
Why?
Would you not agree?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I knew.
I’ll Never Let You Down
He is not a happy person.
I know where I should be headed.
All days of work go by without it rain.
Thank you very much!
I do not want to give up.
What is at the bottom of the list?
I’ll see a match.
It looks normal.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who is involved in the vehicle?
It’s a life - and - death matter.
You are a good student.
Do this.
I know what happened next.
Do You Have Enough Time?
I grew up learning the rules of the streets.
Are you planning to attend the meeting?
I found it difficult to breathe.
Social environment.
Take your time.
Coming!
Why do you feel that way?
