He says that the disappearance of dry - cold areas is heard.
"People are joining in different ways today," he said.
"Lows are no useful places where daily met."
He is deeply concerned about the congregation’s financial status, for the money raised by the leaders by selling congregation goods will not go unnoticed by the people.
He states that the churches can be turned into living quarters that would be of no help to the youngest of the remaining congregations.
Most of the people who buy room rooms in these white people's houses, he said, ‘ They will make it easier for these congregations to be closed legally because they are less likely to become church members."

Self-consument heads of the congregation have written a number of cupboards with complaints that they don't want to burden them with the cost of construction and renting that they as vestry do not get into the contract of those who have a contract with the building.
Some congregation elders cry out in desperation.

Hurricane Rosa attacks the Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City along with flooding (Developing sites)
It is not uncommon for the flu to attack in Arizona, but that is what will happen at the beginning of the week next week as Hurricane Rosa’s strength keeps approaching the desert in the Southwest, bringing catastrophic floods.
Heavenly songs have already issued a warning to watch the floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to the south at the same time as in the east Nevada, southeastern Carlifnia and Utah, cities in Phanix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, coming by Monday and rain.
The voices in Phoenix said in Twittter’s message: “Only ten flys have finally become a quadruplets within 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina(1967) was a hurricane 25 miles [40 km] off the AZ route.
The National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 cm] of zul, with an average 6 inches [6 cm] in Mogollan Rim in Arizona.
In some parts of the desert in the Southwest it is estimated that the central Rockies and the Great Basin are expected to find them one inches [1 to 2 cm] in length, and it must be measured at about four inches [4 cm].
With those early rains, Rosa could be a blessing as part of the drought.
Or the floods are very dangerous, one of the rain will be a reward because in the Southwest it is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Drougth Monitor (see the droughts), 40 percent of Arizona has been attacked by drought, which is in the second largest in the list, the master.com has.
First, a storm that Rosa will pass before Baja California is the Gulf of Mexico.
Rosa, still has the energy of the storm on Sunday morning as she travels at speeds of 85 miles per hour [85 km / hr], 385 miles [385 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and climbs north at a speed of 12 miles per hour [12 km / hr].
A storm is approaching the calm waters of the Pacific and is therefore expected to weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that we have fallen into Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday.
Rain in a number of areas in Mexico can become large, and it can cause devastating floods.
Rain falls from 3 to 6 inches Baja California in the west of Sonara, and about six inches [10 cm] can be obtained, "weather.com reported.
Rosa will then be going north like a storm before she reaches the Arizona border at the second end of the morning, across Arizona and into southern Utah at night.
The greater risk expected for Rosa or for leaving heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonara, and U.S. Southwest, "is the National Hurricane Cente.
These rains are expected to produce life - sustaining floods as well as crystals that flow to the centers, as well as to the tops of mountains.

Trump says Kavanaugh ‘ trouble, cruelty, hatred of the Democratic Party'
"Javaugh’s vote votes to discard the pain and irritation of the Democratic Party," says Trump at the convention at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has said that Kavanaugh has "suffered, anger" of the Democratic Party in all her lifting process.
Kavanaugh has witnessed before Congress on Thursday, against counter to corruption from Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually assaulted decades ago as a child.
Ford too has testified against his accusations.
The President said that on Saturday "the American people are quiet and courageous" of Kavanaugh on that day.

Hundreds are killed by earthquakes, tsunamis, and numbers.
At least 384 people died, many being killed by massive waves during the attacks on the buses, when the earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Suleesian, said the authorities the preceding day.
Hundreds of people were assembled at a party on the port city of Palu on Friday when the 18 - foot [18 m] waves were hit on the bridge at nine o’clock, killing many of them and destroying anything along the way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 feet [7.5 m].
"When the tsunami came out of Thursday, people were doing their work on the beach and did not rush away and become victims," says Sutopo Puroroho, an Indonesian advocate, to attack disasters in BNPB.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, drip cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was crossing the open sea at 800 knots (47 m) before hitting on the sand.
Some people ran to the trees to escape Thursday, he said.
About 17,700 persons were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs taken by the disaster plant showed many buildings and stores destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed, as well as a water - covered station.
The quake continues to move the coastal city all Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was known in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Development of Technology (BPT) says that the stationary force caused by a sudden earthquake on Friday was 200 percent the power of an atom bomb that fell in Hiroshima in World War II.
The city geography, which stands at the end of the long, small part of the city, may increase the size of the tsunami, they say.
Nurroho described damage such as "great" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, stores and hotels had fallen.
Members of other victims are found locked under the roof of broken buildings, said that, adding to 540 injured and 29 died.
Nurroho has said that those who are injured and damage may be large along the coast of some 200 miles [300 km] north of Palu, the area called Donglala, which is near the equator.
The connection "expressed" doesn't have information" from Dogia, lets you say that it's still.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, "expose the Red Cross in the camp, adding that its staff and the antikidians go to the affected areas.
It is said, "This has already been a disaster, but it increases more than this."
Saturdays were widely criticized for not saying that the tsunami was hit in Palu, although the authorities say that the water had arrived when the warning was issued.
A video dealing with the social environment a man at the bottom of a building may sound sounding out warning about a tsunami approaching people on the road below.
Within minutes the water wall of the sea, which removes buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not confirm the video's accuracy immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have resulted in the loss of electricity and communication in Palu that made it difficult for the management to direct relief efforts.
The soldiers have begun to transport cargo by plane from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but the survivors need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only open to relief efforts and will be closed up until October.
President Scott Winji is scheduled to visit the resting - place in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll is above 800.
It’s too bad.
When the workers from the World Vision came out of Dongla have lived in a safe place in Palu, where workers live in shelters built in their office yard, they pass drugs on the way, says Mr. Doverba.
"They told me to see many houses destroyed," he said.
It is worse.
Even as relief groups began to explode to start relief supplies, some complained that the highly informed foreign workers had been prevented from leaving Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, money, goods, goods and services from abroad can begin to flow if the disaster site is said to be the site of a national disaster.
That doesn’t happen.
"It is still only a state disaster." So says Aulia Arrianian, Indosian Red Cross.
"If the government said, "Well, this is a national disaster," we may allow help from other countries, but now it has not yet occurred."
As two days passed after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and family of those still alive hoped that their loved ones would be miraculous in the sight of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was released from the cement.
On Sunday, nurses released a woman who had been locked under the mattress for two days and her mother’s body next to her.
Georgon Subandono, an Indonesian therapist, has trained two disabled individuals who are missing in Asian sports, which was originally included in this same month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were locked up at the hotel in Roa, which is said by Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
He says: “As an elder in the field of disabled ones, I have a sense of responsibility.
Genson explained that, in the hours after the glad tidings of the Roa Hotel in the Pagriding community, he had sent instructions to the Whatsap contest of Palu, which became part of the Beach festival.
His messages, but, in effect, produce one gray mark, rather than blue threads.
"I think that means that the orders are not sent," he said.

Just West: he changed his position to Y.
Dr. Kannye West changes his name - Y.
To announce changes to Twicker on Saturday, he wrote: "You are known as One."

The AMLO of Mexico does not want to use war against citizens
The President of Mexico chosen by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he would not use a military force against the population as the country approaches 50 years of a blood attack against the students.
The Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelco Plaza that you should "never use soldiers to suppress Mexicans."

The Lopez Obrador has promised to support the young Mexicans by providing monthly aid for those who study and open many of the public universities free.
He says that unemployment and lack of opportunities drive youths into criminal activities.
The U.S. must raise support for A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., U.S. must double the number that uses research in the field, says economists and AI, Ka-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Countries that appear after various parts of the U.S. empire have made declarations to AI, as the U.S. generals do not have an AI plan.
Meanwhile, China began its program last year: intended to number .1 to AI in 2030.
"AI research fee will be a good start, since all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success from AI," says Lee.
Conflicting and financial support may increase the likelihood that the greater AI achievement in the U.S., Lee told the CNNBC on this subject.
Lee, his book "AI Superpowes: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order are“ printed this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, Sivanation Places, who has grown from one of the highest AI companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980 ’ s, the Carnegie Mellon University worked on a new AI program for the U.S. Olympic athlete, and later became the head of the Microsoft Research and President of the Google Branch of China.
Lee agreed to a U.S. technical competition as the top Primor of the Robotics Challenge and asked when the next would be coming, to help see the next industry.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to overcome government resources, says Lee.
"No China removes the educational leaders; it’s the companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have used lights from universities to work at AI years later.
Lee said that the changes in the migrant aim can also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be operated automatically on PhDs to AI," she says.
The Chinese Council of China has issued the development of the development of the development of the development of the next developmental technology of the General Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation has donated money from educational institutions such as the National Science Foundation and others in the field of research, but the study industry is small in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year. Defense Department of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should include the staff of the community and the teachers, and the White House has announced the development of a special section of the Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA has spent $2 billion on a program called AI Next.

Meanwhile, the American Constitution on the National Security Commission by Artificial Intelligence has not yet moved.
The Macedonians decide whether they have changed the country’s name.
The Macedonians decided on Sunday to adopt the country’s name as "Reblic of North Macedonia," a campaign to resolve conflict with the Greek state that had already established the interests of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, goes on to say that their neighbors on the north side of their route seek their land and want to enter the NaTO and EU.
Both governments agreed with the word in terms of the word, but some say that changing the word means to look down on the customs of most people in Macedonia who are Slavic
The president of the Gjoge Ivanov said that he would not vote, and protesting the vote made it doubtful that 50 percent of the people would come to the fair.
The question on the vote page reads: "You agree with the NATO and EU by the Greek treaty."
Opponents of the name, counted by General Zoran Zaev, say that it is the modern equivalent of the EU and Nato in Macedonia, some of the countries that have been scattered from Yugoslavia
"I came yesterday to vote our country’s steaks, so that the youngsters in Macedonia will live well under the European Union environment because it describes all our dying health," says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, Skopje.
In any case, sufficient members of parliament made a decision for the vote to accept it.
The change will require two parts of a chain to eat a panamento in a parliamentary.
The country's vote office says that there were no reported reports of disunity at 1 p.m.
Yet, it has been about 16 percent, with 34 percent of the previous parliament votes in 2016 at the time 66 percent of the applicants were registered in their votes.
"I have come out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, the artist in town, Skopje.
The PM of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and her son Dushko have signed an umbrella in Macedonia by changing the country’s name which will open the way to join NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia Seplibe 30, 2018.
Before a parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, preparing the scene and pulling it in front of the tents set up by those who would oppose the rebellion.
"We may have neither the EU nor the U, but we want to join and lay our heads, not by the service door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we are polite.
If they don't want to accept us as the Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the euro-Asiagiation."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the membership of NATO will bring the needed investment in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 percent of the unemployed.
"I believe that 80 percent of our citizens will cry with EU and NATO," says Zaev after taking a gun.
He said "yes" results "the assurance of our future."
The discharge wheel was published at the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research and said between 30 and 43 percent of the votes to share – under expectations.
One wheel, carried by Macedonia's Telma TV, was 57 percent of the participants who planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent says yes.
In order to make the umbrella a success, I’m 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the index will reveal a major problem with pro-Western Government that took a long time in May last year.
Consider: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the wall of all Bricktons to dig
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fell on the walls of Brickton in the Manchester City victory at 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it much easier in his 65 - minute article.
An Argentine cardinal is hanged in the stomach at the beginning of the process.
He was standing among three of the Brightonists, before crossing the court.
Aguero has found herself surrounded by four blue threads.
He has another blocker before he can pass another pile in the box of Brightton.
Then she cries to the left, and she finds Sterling.
The forward playing ring directly touches the ball in the box to return it back to Aguero, who used his right brush to win the Brickton pen of Matthew Ryan on the left article on the left of the net.
"Aguero still faces problems on his feet," the heart manager Pep Guardiola informs the media.
"We talked with him to play for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were fortunate to have a donkey cast into it for a short time.
But it was the Sterling that gave the Sky Blues an opportunity at the start of the Premier League series.
This went out in 29 minutes.
Aguero found a ball in the Brighton sound of the game.
He sent a sweet ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane said that she had touched it before leading Sterling around the corner.
The Sky Brues patrols caught the ball into the cane almost out.
The City competes with the Hoffenheim in the Champions League in a game that will be playing at 12,55 afternoon in Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in the spoiler face. With Rockies
The National Group has been immersed in the plaay off race, there is no reason to force another beginning.
But the challenging Scherzer desires to enter the court on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, which may be possible if the Rockies face problems in the plaloffs, has won one game by holding the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West and NL.
The Rockies are still holding a single song of widd-card by winning 5-2 when they have long been facing the Nationals on Friday of the day, but they are still waiting to hold their first click of a vint.
"Even if we don't play anything, it remains that once we arrive in the Denver situation of its adherents and this one group will be playing the game at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
What could make me want to play there? ’
The Nationals are not the publishers to play on Sunday, but it seems that they can let Sccherzer get into the contest.
Scherzer, who may have entered 34-one, has a bullpen on Thursday and will have dropped on Sunday his rest day.
This Washington right-hand wrist is 2,53 ERA and 220 strikeout in 2/3 in sorrow.
Trump is active in West Virginia
The president has given his speech about the situation surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court when stressing the importance of the departure of the Republicans to the internal choice and leadership.
"All that we have done is in the park by November.
Five weeks before the choice that is most important to our health, we have to make.
This is one of the larger ones, mostly -- I'm not running, but you can say that I am running around so full of fighting for the professional chair," as he said.
Trump has continued, "You see this awful, cruel group of dictatorships of the Democratic Democratic Democratic Democratic Democratic, which you see now.
And they are determined to return to the strength by whatever means they can get, just look at cruelty, and pollution.
They are not concerned about who they hurt, whom they should lament to get power, which is what they want to control and which we will not give them."
Democrats, he said, are in a campaign of ‘ rebellion and disorder. ’
"And if you look at the last four days," he says, calling Democrats "untouched, cruel, unclean and not true."
Then he refers to the Senate of the Senate which calls Sen. Democratic 'Deocrat' by name, which draws water through the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you deinterlace the document?
Ah, yes, I!
No, but, rather, I said that his stand - didn’t tell me good news — I had never seen a man standing so rich. ’
The crew is no longer a congregation.
It is no longer the lawyers who speak from their minds.
When the Momentum officers in my team hired to close my mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But then, I have later joined the MP groups of workers who were told that they are not accepted - simply because of our opinions.
My mother-in-law Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because of opposing anti - Semitic.
In my case, those who wanted me to be silenced criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the sense of the importance of the proposed financial system, in national security, in Europe, and in other surprises Jeremy has shared with other leaders before.
In a notice of the Newttingham East crew's Friday convention, we say, "We want the meetings to be impartial and beneficial."
For nearly a year I've been the MP of my local staff, GC's Friday day meetings have always been.
Sadly, it does not go as well as the public assemblies, and the promise of a ‘ sympathetic, and gentle ’ politics has long forgotten if, indeed, we have ever been present.
More and more it is becoming evident that different views are no longer acceptable to the work force and that views are judged as acceptable to the leaders of the group.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my family, who had the same political views, had seen me taking sides that I would not agree with — regardless of the national security or the financial security of the EU.
Whatever I speak in public, it is no longer necessary and I say that I am going to bring a wave of harassment on social networking that tells me I’m not going to be disfellowshipped, destroying unscathed politics, saying that I should not be in the company of employees.
And I am not alone in facing this.
I know, however, that I am better off than my own because the talks referred to me are still political.
I am still amazed that those of my own loved ones still hold him in the workplace and of their willingness to be self - conscious despite their having to face sexual or racial discrimination.
One of the most discouraging things in this political age is the way the rates of bullying seem unusual.
Jeremy Corbyn said that last week the Labour Parky must set a tradition of limits.
The fact is that we no longer see this large and distrustful church or the ever - changing law of disparage.
I had so much advice in the past two years that I was urged to humble myself, not to talk too much, and it will be "I’m ready."
But I am not involved in politics.
Since meeting Labour for the past 32 years as a student, I was outraged by the government of Thatcher by shouting that he left the funerals in a corrupt school, wanting to bring the best public services to those who desperately need it – perhaps as a local government or as a government minister.
I have never hidden myself from politics, including the final choice.
No one in the Nottingham East can be confused in any way as to the laws of the land and the positions of modern leadership.
For those who have delayed the trip on Friday, everything I can say is that when the world goes on to Brexit that will bring home, business, and our public service, I don't want to spend my time and energy honestly on the director of the Labor Party.
But indeed another message I have in the Nottingham Momentum, to the delegates, whether members of the Labor or not: I am working for you, and I also promise that there will be no threat or political influence that will prevent me from doing what I believe will be good for all of you.
Leslie is of Nottingham East
Ayr has 38- 17 Melrose: Ayr has never been separated from the top.
The recent twin-tries have only reduced the final results, but surely Ayr is worthy to be praised for this modern "Ternant's Premiership.
Now they are divine, which is to jump on the side of ten that can be won.
In the end, their defense, whenever possible, as well as the instructor Peter Murchi, has every reason to be happy.
He said, "All our games have been tested up until now, and we have never won, so I must rejoice."
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: "Praise to Ayr, take advantage of every opportunity beyond ours."
Grant Anderson's 14 minutes, installed by Frazier Cumi, put in front of Ayr, but, the soprano Rory Hughes received a yellow card, was released from Warriors, which caused Melrose to be made for himself and Jason Baggot to catch all triry.
The plant's albatross Ayr went ahead with a pencil, just before, in the first column, and put the o't make 17-5 to Ayr with a break.
But Melrose in the second grade began well, and Patrick Anderson's trinity, installed by Baggot, was reduced by five points.
Then there was the arrest of the time because of the severe damage Ruaradh Knott, he was driven out of the platform, and with the release of Ayr, he continued with Stafford McDowell's Tamo.
The late Ayr Captain has now been given a yellow card, and, too, Melrose has been heavily in debt for the triry of Bruce Colvine, finally by force.
The family had returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson found a yellow card after crossing the non-Blood Cumí, except the penade line, the MacPerson touched the ground over the Ayr.
Also, as she did at first, after Kyle Rowe met with David Armstrong ball that sent David Armstrong to the home side of the fifth.
The game star appears to organize its health at restaurants
The game star Ford Kienran seems to plan to move to cooking after discovering that he had been announced as the official director of the food store.
Jack Jarvis, 56 years old in the popular BBC program, who also wrote and became a well - developed character as well as Greg Hemphil.
Thedu has announced that the next second series will be the last in the order, and it appears that Kiernan planning life after Craiging.
According to the list of administrators, she is the director of the Adriftmon Limite.
The model refused to comment on the matter, yet a Scottish Sun source has suggested that Kiernan is a part of Glasgow's "thriving future record."
‘ Sea is our own: Bolivian leaders hope the court will open the Pacific route
The crew's patrols of the ginging-clad headquarters in La Paz.
Steel platforms raise a white-blue flag.
Naval Basis from Lake Titicaca to Amazon with this inscription: "The sea is by right.
Recovery is our job.
In all parts of Bolivia, the memories of coastline were lost in Chile in the 19th century, as the plant is still clear - since it is eager to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
These expectations are perhaps about your age, Bolivia expecting to be ruled by a world court that will be corrected on October 1.5 years later.
"Wailing has the Power, the spirit of unity and humility, and it is actually expecting the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, who speaks officially to Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch ICJ rolling on large screens everywhere, with high hopes that the Hague court will reward Bolivia’s cry – after years - Chile is forced to negotiate by giving Bolivia control part of the sea.
Evo Morales, the qualified president of Bolivia – who is facing a long debate by selection next year-and has much to do with Monday.
"It's very close to return to the Pacific Ocean," which he swore toward the end of August.
But some critics believe that the court has little chance of achieving Bolivia’s harvests — and that name will change if it agrees.
The Netherlands-registration of the UN has the ability to improve the areas of Chile, which ensures that the outcome of the talk can be determined.
The fact that the ICJ rubling came only six months after the argument was heard that the matter was "not too difficult," said the international policy expert of Chile, Paz Zárate.
Frailing and accomplishing Bolivia’s purposes, the past four years may have taken them back.
"The issue of permission to use the sea is unregistered by the Bolivian authorities," says Zarate.
Morales ’ violent speech undermines the cooperation of Chile, he put it.
Bolivia and Chile will occasionally continue the discussions, but it will be very difficult to continue reasoning after this.
Two countries have not changed for delegates since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, representing Bolivia in Hague, has dismissed charges that the court is too early to make a decision.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new time of association with Chile" and the opportunity "to set up 139 years of disagreement for the advantages of these two countries", and put it.
Calvin also deny that Moreolales – who is one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America – used the sea story as the basis for politics.
"Gavia will never abandon her contribution to the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is an opportunity to prove that we need to overcome the past."
Northern Korea says that the reduction of nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can hope for America.
Foreign minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not stop armed with nuclear weapons first unless they rely on Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at an international conference.
He urged America to follow his promises at a conference in Singapore that was among rival leaders.
His observations until the time of America. World Secretary Mike Poppeo seems to be at the risk of starting the nuclear issue after three months of Singapore and Kim Jon Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is an unrealistic dream that it is a continuing U.S.'s ban on the Korean war treaty to make North Korea paralyzed.
Washington was careful that he would not agree to make Pyongang decree before starting to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S./ American President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
However, there is an increase in the doubt that Pyongy is determined to stop the arms that the world may view as the only way to avoid.
Poppeo plans to visit Pyongng in the next month to prepare for Kim and Trump's second conference.
Paris dress depicts a lot of clothing worn on the heads that comes to the stores near you
If you want to expand your list of hats or just turn off the sun completely, you may no longer be looking at them.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have produced a list of large head hats in their SS19 border on the exhibition in Paris Fashion Week.
Unscrupulous hats are filled with Instagram in this summer, and the builders have brought eye - catching displays.
The boldness of Valentino was a long hat on the side of the ashes of the ashes covered with feathers and a knife over the head of the wearer.
Some of the larger items include carbohydrates with precious stones, the cloak of witches.
Tim Browne produced unusual facial masks in Halloween time.
Many masks in the mouth look like Honsibal Lacter rather than as something made by the foremost designers.
Another structure that is similar to the swimwear of water has a breathing apparatus as well as a port.
If you persist in a casual fashion, you can put yourself at ease.
Caravans discovered that large hats could be on their way to major shopping malls.
The main hat was soon followed by I ‘ The Twomb', a twin-foot hat to open in this solar eclipse, which appears in Rianna' to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of an inflatable hat that is popular on the page of communication has sent other items to a show-sea container that is about the size of a swimming pool shown by the proprietor.
The hot orange bag made from the rafiya tree was moved, covered with white skin on the hold, visiting us alone in the Janquemus ’ La Riviera SSS19 in the fashion exhibition in Paris.
The well - known designer Luke Artimage told FEMAIL ‘ I expect to see large hats and sea bags coming to the big stores in the next summer as the designers have a greater impact. It will be difficult to recognize the need to do the larger things like the ladder.'
John Edward: Natural engineering is important to the population of the continent.
The private schools in Scotland keep the details of good results, and this has continued in the year 2018 for some positive studies, which are confirmed only by the success of the individual and his colleagues in sports, art, music, and other public efforts.
With a negative number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these colleges are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), pressing towards a higher level of help.
Self - appointed schools intend to prepare students for higher education, as well as for their choice of employment and community life as citizens in the country.
As a educational center that you can organize and start a special educational program, we see the modern crop continue to be a popular and popular field for schooling.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to the man about the monies he hears, what you say goes directly to his head."
If you talk to her about her breast, she will go into her heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we will not always trust in English if we want to build relationships and trust with foreigners.
From the results of the testing of tests of this year, we can see that the lead lemons in the center are the most effective in private schools.
Sixty-eight of all students who learned outside vegetables received A High Class.
Symptoms, gathered from seventy - four SCIS schools, indicate that seventy - two percent of the students received A Class in Mandarin, since another seventy - two percent of German students, 6 and 9 percent of those who studied French with 6 - 3 percent who also learned Spanish and also received A.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills for children, young people will no doubt need them in the future.
Democracy is now a choice for a study, considered to be the same as formal education (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in schools that represent the educational program and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employmy and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of staff could be able to close the gap of 17 percent.
So especially, linguistic ability is important in preparing young people for employment opportunities.
Through many hopes that I have learned languages, these skills are vital to a united world.
Whatever the case, if they learn the second grade, they put themselves in a better position in their future to develop a skill such as that of the opposite sex.
Being able to communicate with people from other lands puts a person on the back of a number of drums in front of those who compete with him.
According to a report by Yeu Gov of more than 4000 adults in the UK year 2013, 77 percent (75 percent) could not speak well of foreign grammar and communication and only one French is produced by 2 percent of the population, 15 percent (15).
There can be a valuable resource for today’s children to grow in the field of macadamia.
Having as many fields as you know, especially those of developing countries, will help to equip children for better employment.
In Scotland, schools and schools vary from one language to another.
Most of the schools focus particularly on teaching the old and modern plants, and some teach the items that are considered highly important in the UK in the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there are many types of lemons that you can choose from private schools and guide the natives in this area.
The private schools of Scotland are committed to providing education that will prepare children and equip the children for the skills required to succeed, this time in the future.
Without being denied in the present time, the world’s business enterprises will continue to be important for the world’s future, so I have been exposed to education.
In fact, modern atoms must be included in the "in world communication skills."
Self - appointed schools will continue to offer this opportunity, variety, and makeup to young Scottish people.
You must do the right thing.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

The Trump's selection race in West Virginia, when will it begin?
Trump's choice choice at Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at seven o’clock in the evening. At T, Saturday, 29 History 2018.
You can view the Trump selection race in West Virginia by login to YouTube and look at what is happening now.
Trump may have taken the lead in the church to the decision of the supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, under the charge of sex cases and the waiting officer of the Senate vote.
However, the aim of the storm is to help the Republicans gain the courage to cope with the Nazi choice.
Thus, president Trump said in his campaign that the five - car races a week will be “expressing volunteers and followers as the Republicans try to protect and increase the number of followers they have in parliament," according to Reuters.
The "control of the hull is important in this policy of the president of many countries that can visit them as we have gone through the busy time of the campaign" is denying the mouth of the Trump's campaign against Reuters to reveal his name.

The Rylands statement 2018 The American Group hopes to fight and maintain the hopes of a single day's sports on Sunday.
After a three - part meeting, on Saturday afternoon, the Rylands are probably four times longer.
The instrument of enthusiasm is a program of a game that has been started but that the players believe in, not in comparison.
Where, then, will they now assert their power?
"They take six points and are now four, so we continue as if by little I think I'm thinking" says Jordan Spiegel as they drive less slowly in the day.
Europe has an opportunity, indeed, four points ahead of twelve.
Americans, as Spieth said, have little joy and much encouragement, not the way Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and each got three to four points.
Spieth has always been dangerous and has led an exemplary course.
Those seeing him were very happy when he was, exercising patience so that a game could be equal when he himself broke up with Thomas.
His rap he introduced and won a game in 15 with the same thrill, this type convinces you that he believes that the American team has not gone out.
"You will really have to dig deeper and worry about your game," says Spieth.
It is one of the remaining players.
18 holes to mark.
The only player with more guns than Spieth and Thomas two days ago was the Frenchsco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, not asked in the Rylands Cup.
Europe's dud but a cross that makes much easier and more willing.
"Moliwood" is the only ones who will not start the hogey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoidbogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
The pace, in the sense that both of them are at the top of the noisy crowd who conclude that they are the winners of the Church, and no more well - known athletes will be eager to win Europe as the sun sets the Golden National Sun than the Fleetwood or Molinari.
The same is true of the two holes
The talk about European fame has not changed, though.
Bubba Watson and Web Sumpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, the early warriors of thephobals in the morning, when arrested by Alex Noren.
Bogy and the leading Doubles have left the deep entrance to Spain and Sweden that cannot be reached.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Fourbals and foursomes enjoy watching closely as a result of cooperation between the map, the advice they give, the unscathed counsel, and the way a scheme can change quickly.
Europe has played well as a group and led to the end, but thefourges have shown that the USA still had the power to continue, by choosing the United States, they were skeptical.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the last day of the Rylader Cup.
Europe will be in the best bank on the last day of Rylader Cup after leaving the same fourbals on Saturday by 10-6 leading the United States.
du Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won twice as hard as drawing Tiger Woods with four points of Gof National.
On the European side Thomas Bjorn, the willingness to clear up the cup that had lost them in Hazeltine two years ago, the failure of America to the general faurels, put the 31 series.
The U.S. is too hard to stop thephoursomes, to win two games, but will not only be self - destructive.
On his side Jim Furyk needs nine points from the 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to get a series of points after he himself, Molinari, called him "Millillwood" after a good weekend of four seniors who received four points in their first four games in the Rylader Cup history.
By dividing the Woods and Patrick Reed from thefobals afterward they introduced the bight Woods and the American Bryson Dechabeau in 5&4.
Woods, who entered two Saturday games, showed a strong commitment, but now he lost 19 of the 29 fourbals as well as the records.
Justin Rose, sitting in the morning follies, returned to the letters Henrik Stenson to the mounts in 2&1 to divide Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third parts of the world.
And they are determined to return to the strength by whatever means they can get, just look at cruelty, and pollution.
Jordan Spieth and Justini fell three times breaking the Americans apart on three points on Saturday.
They gained 2&1 by dividing Jon Rahm the Ian Poulter of Spain into the fourbals and later across the Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 &3 in the foursomes while searching for two open holes.
In the history of Rylader Cup only two times having a group from four points to a single game, Furyk needs only a measure to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, Sunday attacks seem to overwhelm them.
The North Korea says that ‘ he cannot be armed without trust.
A North Korea foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that it continues to fuel infidelity to the United States and that it is impossible for the world to free nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body of the General Assembly that North Korea had made the "recontact" last year, such as preventing the nuclear and pursuing nuclear weapons, and promising not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "No, we don’t see answers from the U.S."
"Without trust the U.S. will there be little hope of security in the world, and under this condition there is no way for us to develop ourselves first."
While It disagrees with North Korea’s claims on Washington's refusal of the U.S. government while North Korea may be recommended by taking action, the stammerin is an evidence that it does not prevent nuclear extinction as Pyongang did in the past.
Ri refers to the element established by Kim Jon and Donald Trump when they first met between the president of the U.S. and the North Korea leadership in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work in the "denendation of the Korean pen" while Trump promised the protection of North Korea.
North Korea had been seeking to bring an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongang to release nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists with the "intercontinentration" and sets up pressure levels to carry out its purpose by force, and also deny the "Abstance of the end of war" says Li.
"Be aware that the law can lower us the dream of people who don’t care about us.
But the problem is that continuing to advance only aggravated our feelings of insecurity.
Ri did not introduce plans for reuniting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader displayed in the United Nations from the community.
He has at least three meetings between Kim and the South Korea Mooon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If part of this case of nuclear extermination was in South Korea and not in the U.S., the total loss of Korean penicillin would not result in this commitment."
Or it is said, the sound of Ru’s speech is quite different from that of last year, when he tells the U.N. General Assembly to look forward to the U.S. North Korea's occkets that took place after "M.U. Bad President Trump called Kim "rocket Man" in this regard.
This year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to ‘ completely wipe out" North Korea, exalted Kim with her courage not to take an armed stand, but much remains to be done and the law remains until North Korea eliminates the cancer.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn’t have any time for all of this, saying, "If it takes two, three, or five years – there is no problem."
The very Russian dispute is called the U.N. Security Council to be effectively recommended for Pyongang in action taken.
Nevertheless, U.S. State Secretary Mike Poppeo told the U.N. Security Council in Thursday: The Security Council must act decisively and fail until we see the conclusion, complete, and evidence of nuclear extinction.
The Security Council agreed to support North Korea’s violation of the law since 2006 in establishing a campaign for the paying of the horn and the Pyongngian system.
Poppeo met Ri standing with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all of us are still there again to visit Pyongng in the next month.
Pompeii has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been a pleasant one.
He left Pyongangy in July which progress was made, of North Korea only by openly exposing him as “just as a criminal."
North Korea arranges a meeting with Manoon this month to finish the gas field and the nuclear mixture if the United States take the same "actions."
She said that Kim told me ‘ the same steps ’ she wanted to strengthen security when Trump promised to be in Singapore and created a general social environment with Washington.
Harvard course students help them to get sufficient sleep
A new Course at Harvard University this year all who have never married sleep so much that they can overcome the study habit using caffeine ‘ all night. ’
The fields of education have found many students at prestigious universities that they are useless when it comes to the basics of raising a dog.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a nurse in Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed course, the first of this kind of US.
She was encouraged to start the sponge after giving a talk on how much sleep is lost in reading.
'At the end the girl came to me and said, 'Why am I told this now, in my middle age?'
She said that no one told her about going to bed – to my surprise, ' tell Telegram.
First released this year, Course explains to the students the importance of sufficient sleep habits to benefit the stadium and exercise, and it promotes daily well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and also director of the University's health services, said the university decided to die of course after discovering that most students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study course includes a series of actions.
The first part is the picture of the school room, where students choose coffeesses, preferences, tutors, and books about the effects of caffeine and the light of exercise for sleep, and how to sleep.
On the other hand, participants are told that staying away from long sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, seizures, and cancer.
The compass map, with helpful symbols, will encourage those who share in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
‘ We know that it will not change the students ’ behavior immediately.
We believe that they have the right to know – as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke,' adds Professor Czeisler.
The custom of boasting in the community until 'is the thing done, which, in addition to that modern technology and excessive pressure on students, reduces sleep levels that are a serious problem.
To ensure that you sleep well, enough, it must be a ‘ secret weapon ’ of the student to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means to avoid weight loss, since sleep puts the mind on the condition of hunger, causing them to hunger.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19 - year - old student in California who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to design a study, having studied in one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the study had opened his eyes and urged him to speed up the study to the whole center.
The next step, of hope, is to invite senior graduates to study the same way as this study program before joining this well - competitive center.
Prof Czeisler recommends that the students have to think about taking thelarms when they go to bed, and so that they will wake up, and understand the bad effect of the ‘ blue light ’ produced by the electric crystals and the LED light, which can take you out of the orbit, leading to the degree of the angle.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ringers: Menga’s article down Gerard’s men
The Ringers has been organized and gone away during the attack by Dolly Menga who attacked the victim of Steven Gerard, who broke down and failed to 1-0 in Livingstone.
Ibrox has intended to record their first victory since they were victorious on February 41 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's party who played the second side of Gerard's division in 18 games as the executive who left behind him with eight points on the Ladbrokes Premierp Hears.
Imagine that you attack seven minutes before the haf-time, and the Ringers endure not to bow down.
By now the Ringers had fallen to the sixth location, Livingstone’s third point and behind the Hibernia differs from their point of view.
And there would be a problem to come to Ringers after you lined Calum Spence with the first aid after an accident caused by a distant accident.
Gerard made eight changes on the previous part of the Ayr to the Betfred Cup hints.
Holt, on the other hand, has gone with the same Vivi 11 who missed a point on the Hears last week and had no joy in the way your well - dressed clothes would get out of the air on all sides.
Ringers may have held a lot of hold on a ball, but Livingstone did much with a ball he found.
They would have agreed in two minutes when Menga’s sleeping invitation sent Scott Pittman to an article by Allan McGregor, but the performer in the stomach had lost much of his opportunity to drive the pipe.
Keagaghan Jacobs's credit card, found Craig Halkettoi-stock, but her boyfriend Alan Lithogow has cut it off from the background.
Ringers has managed to control but has been more confident than believing in their game in the final third stage of the game.
Alfred Morelos felt that he should have received a penny in ours when he was in trouble with Steve Lawles, but the nurse Steven Thomson had canceled the request for Colombian.
Ringers are able to put two points in the first section directly opposite the cross but with the old Ibrox palmy Liam Kelly with no concern about the relief put on the head of Lasana Couubaly and the soothing attack of Ovie Ejaria.
When Livi could not open at least 34 minutes for it may not have been fun, no one would deny that it was appropriate for them to work.
The Ringers again failed to resist the edge of Jacobs ’ soccer.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher hurled Scott Robinson, who was at our lowest call, quickly sent Menga to finish.
Gerrardube and movement after a break while converting Colorado on Ryan Kent, and the change is almost immediate when the athlete drops off to Morelos but the fascinating Kelly runs from his canal.
But Livingstone also goes on to describe the spectators as playing their game, including Lithogow and Halkette.
Holt’s side could open the gap in leadership in the final stages, but McGregor stood up and forbade Jacobbs before Lithgow struck a ball on his head in a corner.
Advis Ringers Glenn Middleton finds a pin in his battle with Jacob but Thomas is also looking in the opposite direction.
Almanac: Geger Council engineer
And And now our page "Sun Sunday morning" Almanac: Sepba 30, 18882, 136 years ago, and UBA... the day the future physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of finding and comparing radioactivity, which was developed that led to a multipliced industry that came to be the Geger Council.
The scientific threshold since then, the Geiger Council, which became the nucleus of the post pole, as in the 1950 branches "Bells of Coronado," to feed on the fields of scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘ Is that? ’
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, used to obtain radioacive minerals, such as saltium.
When you insert open earphones, you can hear atoms removed by a radioactivity.
Evans: "Yes, they are removing it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he celebrated 63 years.
But this beginning bears his name forever.
A new goal of cancer may teach the defense system to ‘ see the wrong cells
A new goal of cancer may teach the defense system to ‘ see the wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the immune system to ‘ see the wrong cells as a treatment program.
The method involves taking the protective cell cells from the patient, which are changed to the blue.
'They' see normal protein in most cancers and re-intercent
The goal of color is to show the promising results for patients with certain types of fertilizers.
A woman with a goal - tested goal, who teaches the immune system to detect the wrong cell cells, saw the cancer of the womb vanish for 18 months.
This method involves taking protective cells from the patient, converting a bottle to "see" common protein in a large case called HER2, and re-containing cells.
Professor Jay Bezofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results prove that we have a promising goal.
HER2 "profession of cancer," includes breast, uterine, pulmonary, and other tumors, explains Prof Bezof Bezofsky.
The same way to take protective cells from patients "you can teach them" is how you understand the cancer cells that have done well in treating some type of leukemia.
Just as West was in the idea of sewing Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after he came out of a glass suit.
Not Junk
Once West was introduced to the Saturday Right Lives after singing praises to American President Donald Trump and saying that he would make a choice in 2020.
After singing his third song at night, named Ghort Town in the form of a cap written by the Make of America Great, he was starting to sound with Democrats and confirmed accuracy for Trump.
"I often talk to the white man and say: ‘ How can you love Trump, are you prejudiced? ’
If I had been concerned about prejudice, I would have been away from America for a long time, ’ he said.
SNL opens the program with the Matt Damon chapter when a Hollywood character challenged Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senior Judicial Committee on sexual offenses by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not widely distributed, this West - noise section was placed in the chat rooms by the comical character Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to discredit the West by writing it.
Similarly, the West complained to onlookers that he was being mistreated at the back of the stage and put on the head.
"They were very strict with me behind the platform.
‘ Don't miss the hat, ’ they said.
I was devastated!
They also said that I was out of the rubble," he said, according to the Washington Researcher.
The West continues: ‘ Do you want to see a place in the gurgle? ’ which says ‘ he can wear his superman cap, for it does not tell him what to do. What do you want the world to continue?
Try love.
Not long ago it was heard by the shy SNL viewers and the shy singing crew, Variety reported, alone telling the printers: "The silence was quiet."
The West was inserted with the pledge of the singer Ariana Grande, her old boyfriend, the Rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
The West wrote many about the song I Love, dresed as a Perrier Botle.
West was represented by the head of the former TPSA group, Candance Turner in the Tititter, said: "Kono with amazing courage: WE RESOURCE TO ACTURE.
But the director of a chat program, Karen Hunter, wrote to howtiter said that West "you must be the person who lives and that’s good."
"But I chose not to lend credit to anyone (by buying his music or his dress or dress) that I believe they are wearing and full of a dangerous idea in the community.
You are free.
So it is, he adds.
Before the presentation, the Rapper comes to Twitter to change his name, which is now to be called "The Old Name West."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Deddy, also known for Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Deddy.
The rapper, Snop Dogg, was once called Snop Lion and indeed the late singer Prince, changed his name by symbol and named Prince.

HIV/Aids: China reports 14% to progress in new circumstances
China announces the increase in 14% of the population who live with AIDS and spread AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases are reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases come.
Most of the new cases are presented with sex, and changes have been made from the past.
But the number of people who received AIDS in this way has been reduced to that, said the Chinese health authorities regularly at a district convention of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV / AIDS has risen to 100,000.
The combination of AIDS now minimizes a small problem in the LGT commonity.
The offense of dating and homosexuality in China was removed in 1997, but it is increasingly common among same - sex people.

Much of the spread of disease in defense is wrong in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to reach the world’s depths as a means of coping with the problem.
Maxxine Waters deny that some work has broken the information of the GOP comators's, a dangerous 'false' and other 'betrays'
In the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has passed charges that one of his employees enter a list of three satellites in the Republic in the U.S.
The Democrats of Los Angeles explained that the charges are spread by the "ultra-rightwing" and the Internet.
" lies, lies, and many other shocking lies," says Waters in the station on Twicker.
The broken data includes the home addresses and numbers of U.S. S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hitch, both in Utah.
Information appears on the Internet on Thursday, installed in Capitol Hill while being breast - controlled by the Senate in sexual scandals by the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
This break occurs after Kavanaugh was put into three snats.
Long - term Web sites such as Gateway Put and RedS State report that IP adres points to the Waters office related to it and that it is the one who has published the name of the Waters's project, reports Hill.
"These unverified charges are false and are not true," Waters continues.
"My staff's good – ownership, personal identity, and safety as a result of fraud and lying accusations – did not join the master’s explosion.
These charges are really false and are not true.
Waters's statement soon became a criticism to the Internet, including the chief Author of the White Housepress, Areischer.
"This is to deny rather than fatigue," writes Flaviicher.
"This explains that he does not have the mildness of the Communist Party.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be discouraged.
They should not give up.
They should not question the motive of the one doing the judging.
They must be calm and peaceable.
Fleischer would have compared the answer to the condemnation of the Democratic Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics who had been very tired during a trial on Thursday.
The Omar Navarro, a winner of the Republic to enter Waters's shoes in the middle choice of time, breathing with him in his opinion on Twick.
"Size if true," writing to Twicker.
In his station, Waters said that his office had brought to him the ‘ fair - minded officials and the lawyer’s staff with these charges of fraud.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," he continues, "and they will be accused of all their acts of vandalism and danger to any or all my workers."
A vision of Johnny English Strikes Against In – lowering the impact of Robin Atkin
It is now a custom to consider the importance of Brexit in any British film and not to be seen accompanied by the rise of this Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and its return in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Taking in hot potatoes as meant in the article that we could have a new opportunity to sell outside?
At any rate, the open eye, the Johnny English champion’s propensity for a second - time promotion — that name is a big joke designed for the movie theater for people who do not speak English.
He is indeed an uninterrupted investigator who is even more than his unusual hypocrisy to glory reveals Clousau, Mr Bean’s degree and pressure from the Chariots of Fire in London's 15th-day Olympic War.
It also comes from a traveler and a mysterious man named Atkinson who passes through the latest advertisements and has been corrupted in the Barclaycard TV, who has left a mess in his wake.
There are also other times of this present visit to the Lord.
I love Johnny English for riding a helicopter while wearing an old military suit and small swords hanging on his hat.
The gift of Atkinson is a scene, but laughter looks low and is extremely exaggerated, especially in the production of "deep" films like  007 and the Mass pumpsable itself now offer laughter as a ingredient.
The laughter we say is more than older people, and to me Johnny English’s journey is unobtrusive and firm in the noisy Atkinson film added to Bean’s noisy sounds and personality.
The story in the palace is now that Great Britain is in a large cave.
The Rever-harder enters the British checkbox, presenting the data of British jellyins in the field, which is concerned with a job - which is a small task for Kevin Eldon.
The last minute in the prime of the prime minister is hard, faced with a political failure: Emma Thompson is trying hard to imitate Teresa-May but there is no reason to question the text.
His investigators informed him that the entire observer had been condemned, and they would have to wait for the person still in charge.
This means that Johnny English himself, now as a cholmaster at a pay point, but he gives some unwritten lessons about what the observer is going through: laughter, as English gives the study of the Rock-type acedies.
Englishzed to Whitehall to be given urgent orders and to join her partner Bough, was also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, associated with submarine commander, a delightful place played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of making things very comfortable with the Queen’s secret Service back, encountering the Olga Kurylenko's if there is a smokefinate Oppellia Bulletin.
There, the prime minister quickly sinks into the development of millions of claims that he can solve computer problems: the sniper Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started out with a complicated journey: hiding as a mata, starting a fire in a restaurant in France; they started the problem by selling themselves in the Volta canoe; and English that took a break while learning to use the Virtual Reality headset to practice themselves.
All efforts are made to improve the final session or to communicate with stress, rather than the children’s TV on everything.
They are very serious.
And like other films by Johnny English I could not hold back: did not the British movie industry in Britain give Robin Atkinson a good indication of his talent?
Labour deny that they are developing a plan for Britons to work four days but paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s team of Labor is to think of a marvelous plan to see Britons working for four - but five victims.
The team reported that it required the management of the company to pass the profits made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the staff by giving them more day.
The workers seem to enjoy the company’s joy on the last three days of the week - but pay the same amount.
According to sources, this view can suit the economic and social purpose of the group as well as the scheme to convert the nation into workers.
The transition in four days is authorized by the Trade Union Congress as a way to take the economic exchange.
An elderly source of Laborur Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ A police test is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'Not by night but by four days in the church, but working four days is a matter of concern with the process of reemerging the economy and reaping the workers and the whole idea of the field'.
The Labour Party will not be the first to recommend the strategy, and the Green Party who adheres to the four working days at the time of the 2017 General log service.
The goal is not yet set for the entire Labour Party, yet.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ‘ The activity of four days is not a party police force and it is not thought of by a group at all.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a church council of the last Labour to express his view of the sociolist evolution in the economy.
Mz McDonnell said that you are willing to look up and have the power returned to ‘ unknown guides and ‘ winners ’ in the firms.
The program and the tadow chlyllor also explains that the hareholders in the water industry may not find the whole chart as the Labour government does to ‘ draw' in the wrong way.
He also ensures putting the staff on the company's board and on the Incruve Onership Funds to give 10 per cent percent of the value of the private-sctor-sampsity to the staff, who will weigh the value of £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy argued "60 Minutes" that the FBI study of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
Research on the subject of the FBI by Judge Brett Kavanaugh has reduced the time of election to be elected by the Supreme Court last week, and raises questions that the detectives ’ findings may change the way socialists in the Republic are influencing the followers.
In a conversation on Sunday, "60 Minutes" the interviewer Scott Penley asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if he could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more relaxed than his South Carolina partners.
"I’ll say, yes," says Kennedy.
"I have come to the side, and I have also spoken to the judge, Kavanaugh.
When I called him after this, the complaints came out, saying, 'You have done it?'
She is stubborn, stubborn, and unobtrusive.
Graham’s vaccine, however, seems to have been cut off.
"My mind is determined by Brett Kavanaugh and will take strong criticism," he says.
"D. Ford, I don’t know what to do, but I know this: Brett has immediately refused," adds Graham, explaining of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not all readers are sure of that.
It has been 36 years.
I don't see anything that changes.

How successful has Global Citizen been in the 12 years that have now reached its goal?
Is the idea of benefiting people without free social mediation a suitable way to try people to do something, or is it just another called "clickivism" - people who feel they do make a difference by signing a list on the computer or sending it to the test?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen is the top "actions" of its more than 19 billion adherents, which are missing the management of different objectives.

The group also said that for over 5,000 years to call the U.K. to improve the quality of a good diet for mothers and children, the government has announced the proméjekti, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach the women and 5 billion children by entering the proper diet.
In answer to some of their Web site asking "What do you think we can do to get rid of the big waste?"
Global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
Yet, as public rights and anti-partheid protests before us, we will win, for we are very strong together.

All said that Russian and Syria’s conversations clearly, when working through official government eclipses – it is a way to try some newenergy markets.
"I believe in the reason why the Middle East wants to find an ergy as far as Eastern Europe, and between the middle of the middle of the centre and Europe," he reports.
Also, according to the worker, there are ways to repair it.
"The United States knows, Through our organization, to ensure that seaways are opened and, if necessary, shut down, to ensure that their power does not go to the market," she says.

These stamps appear as Trump’s office endeavors to promote the export of their natural gas into Europe, instead of Russia, the cheapest way for European consumers.
As a result, officials of the Trump office, including the president of the US, are trying to encourage Germany to get out of the Nord Stream 2, "undue", according to Trump, who made Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the pipes of North Stream 2 are $111 million, which is planned twice as much as the present number of pipelines, which are about 100 feet [110 m] in diameter, is truly economic.
The Kremlin says that Washington’s ongoing opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unjust competition.
"I believe we have the same idea that power cannot be a tool of stress and that consumers should be able to choose whom they buy," says Russian General Aleksandr Novak after an assembly with the U.S. Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow by September.
The position of the US caused Germany to fall short, confirming her commitment to the project.
A leading German industrial organization, the Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told US to withdraw from the superpower project of the EU and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interrupts our sending power," says Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Indurities (BDI) after the recent conference between the German Chancellor Angela Merel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The 18 bytes, D.C., support the work of a new protection policy
The 18 states as well as the District of Columbia support a new legal effort to develop a new U.S. policy that prohibits protection from drug or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and circuits sent a post office to witnesses on Friday in Washington to support a person in need of protection against this goal, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the miracle in Grace v. Sessions which the American Civil Liberties Union has installed in August against the policy of the state is not revealed.
He said that his associates ‘ and his sons who are members of violent crime, ’ who harassed him but U.S. officials would not accept his request for protection on July 20.
He has been settled in Texas.
Officials who supported Grace defined El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces many people with U.S. defense appeals, such as nations facing serious problems with terrorism and domestic violence.
A new U.S. security policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immmigrant Appels that allowed non-registered immigrants to flee domestic violence for protection.
The Columbia National Attorney General of Columbia State Karl Racine stated in its words on Friday a new goal is "not to be ignored for decades by the law of the state and of the whole world."
"The law says that all requests for protection should be judged by the facts of each request, and to make a decision such as this is a violation of that law," says a court official.
The attorneys also point out that the policy preventing immigrants from entering the U.S. economy also kills, saying that they may be businesspeople and ‘ created jobs. ’

"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or terror because of race, religion, nationality, or political opinion," said Session in his declaration on June 11.
Protection was not intended to eliminate all problems -- not even all the major problems that people face daily throughout the world.

The U.S. ambassador charges China with ‘ false advertising ’
After a week the Chinese official newspaper of China had a four - page advertisement that depicts U.S. trades for both the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing by using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of China’s donated goods in Des Moines Register - a newspaper of Iowa that was bought with truism - after accusing China of wanting to enter the race on November. 6 U.S., which is a refusal to China.
Trump's charge that Beijing was trying to enter the U.S. election has created what U.S. U. officials have declared Reuters in the new category in the Washington campaign to suppress China.
Although foreign governments are often to advertise to sell, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a growing commercial war that has created a cycle of constant taxation in exchange for goods.
The money required by China at the beginning of the war of trade was intended to oppress the delegates in such places as Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, says the analysts of China and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador and former prime minister in Iowa, who sent most agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in the Sunday edition Des Moines Register, "we have twice the harassment by making false advertisements in our free newspaper."
"In the countries that have been distributed, the Chinese government has made it available in the popular American culture of free access to free press by placing a commercial advertising on Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
“ On the contrary, at the road market here in Beijing, there are few different ideas you will find and you will not see the real reaction of the various Chinese people who may have the effects of China’s economic crisis, if it is thought that the news is viewed as such by the Chinese Common Party, ” she writes.
He has added that “one of China’s leading newspapers has fled from the opportunity to publish his story, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans Burning Women Before Middle Select and Time for Kavanaugh’s Failure, Warning the Investigators
Since many of the highest republics are waiting and protecting the outcome of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in a number of charges against rape, the reviewers have warned that the wood will return with the passengers, especially the farmers, during the term within the next period.
The divine lungs in this regard, and many Republicans are already showing that they wanted to advance with choice.
These things will no longer be ignored," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School telling The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher has doubted that Sennacherib’s final efforts to make the FBI check will be sufficient to enable angry people to slow down the lungs.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday - won’t forget what happened tomorrow and November," says Karine Jean-Piere, a red counselor and a national spokesman for the progressive Move On, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors announced, "Come November!" as they were protesting in the Senate hall as the Republicans ruled the Judiciary Committee prefer to continue and choose Kavanaugh despite evidence from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democratic support of Democrats and ambitions will end," says Stu Rothenberg, a politically neutral commentator, telling the media.
"People say it’s already hot; the truth is that.
But it may be even higher, especially among women's courting people in towns and youth, aged 18-9, which, although not interested in the president, is not common to vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which contains details of his accusations of abuse against the appeal of the Supreme Court, the investigators said that the wood could be returned if the Republics continued to ensure.
"This is now the damage to the GOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It’s not just about a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on a bench, about how the Republicans deal with this and how they treat him," says Guy Cecil, director of Pririties USA, a group that helps people to choose Democrats, telling the press station.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided on which to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and are inclined to win Kabaugh.
New statistics from Yeu Gov indicate that 4 percent of people are either sure or to some degree do not believe Ford testimony, whereas 35 percent say that they truly believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was sure or that to some extent he was lying on the testimony he gave, whereas 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the move by the Flake, the FBI now investigates the charges brought by Ford and at least one reporter, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Senate Juiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had been drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the accused in the Supreme Court presented his private parts to him during the party during your study period in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The World Wide Web Plan to Start a New Network to Fight With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Le, founder of the World Wide Web, begins a program that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
New technology Project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open source of the Berners-Le platform.
Soid allows users to choose where their net is to be kept and the knowledge that people are allowed to reach.
In a unique conversation with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of Inrupt's purpose "to dominate the world."
"We must do it now," she says so.
"It is a history."
This applet uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal storage area" or POD data.
It can also include lists of numbers, which you have to do, calendars, music library, and other electronic equipment as well as a person.
It is as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlouk, Slack and Spouty are all found in the same brush and at the same time.
What is significant about a POD store is that it depends on the user as to who can get information.
The company calls it a "Data that gives you power."
The concept of the Inrupt, in accordance with the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company has brought inrsosis, physics, and the skills necessary to make Soid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Le, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, the foundation-builders, the foundation-hand workers with a commission to work on the project, as well as a number of volunteers.
Since this report, the inventors of technology around the world may create their caps using tools found on the Inupt web site.
Berners-Le said that she and her group of speakers and "Facebookbook and Google say whether it should or should not be brought to complete change where all their business is going to change completely.
"We don't ask their permission."
In another post in the Medium printed Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "is to provide the power of trade and a system that will help to protect integrity and the new web locker built on Soid."
In 1994, Berners-Le changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Le has led the debate on neutrality.
Even when Inupt is published, Berners-Le will always be the Designer and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the West Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to the start of this coming tab period," adds Berners-Le.
Bernard Vann: Praised the Victoria Cross for WW1
The only prelate of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during the first World War I has been popular in his city some 100 years later.
Lt Col, Professor Bernard Vann, won the prize in 29 September 1918 against the invasions of Belllingise and Lehauccourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not find out that he had won the greatest prize in the British army.
A monument has been opened to her two great grandchildren on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, has been a "good sign" that the stone has been opened in the year 100 directly since his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, in September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quntin "in the blow of explosions and guns and guns."
Later he rushed to the place where he was shot and was "with great courage" led forward before running with a rifle and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gunman in October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, age 72, says that his grandfather's actions "I don't know I could not do myself, but something that makes me respect him."
She and her brother Dr. James Vann put flowers behind the watches, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that it is "the most privileged to have a share in the clock" and said that the "power of the real community is shown by the support given to most people."
MMA's followers stay all night to watch the Bellator 206, but find Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay all night to watch the Bellator 206 and then be forbidden to watch the event.
The San Jose party had 13 games, including six in the main card and was shown all night in UK on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Moussi and Roy MacDonald were ready for battle, the UK watcheds were left in shock when the station changed to Peppa Pig.
Some would not be happy after waiting all night until the early hours of the morning were spent waiting for the contest.
One TWirtter pursuer described this change in children's animation as "an unexpected smile."
"It is government policy that by 6 a.m. the contest was inappropriate and therefore had to be changed to the children's organization," says Dave Schwartz, president of Bellator's sales and communications manager, when asked about this change.
"Wave the pig," yes."
The president of the Bellator Company Scott Coker said that they would take a closer look at their sharks to unite UK observers in the future.
"I think that if I think of playing it again, I think we can try to play it again," says Corker.
"But it is the sixth hour on Sunday there that we will not be able to fix the matter until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But we are dependent on it.
I tell you, during the time of the change, there are a lot of messages that have been delivered, and all of them were not pleasant.
We were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise that it will never happen again.
We will keep five games less than six — as we normally do, and we have tried to make our followers happy and have gone too far.
It would be an unacceptable situation.
Desert Island Class: Tom Daley felt that she had been abandoned because of her sex.
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he has grown up isolated because of his sex - but that gives him the incentive to succeed.
This 24 - year - old player did not realize it until he went to high school to say, "I don’t like everyone else like me."
Speaking of Radio 4 Desert Island Dircs first distributed by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke of homosexual rights in order to give some "hope."
He also said that if a parent had made him responsible for winning the Olympics.
The regular media of the time, irty Young, has spent months working because he is sick.
Reflecting as a person abandoned in the first edition of Laverne, Dayley said that she felt that she was ‘ isolated ’ by everyone as she grew up because it was“ not allowed to love boys and girls. ”
He said: ‘ To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, feelings of isolation, and feelings have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she too was a ‘ human, ’ she said, so that no one would be disappointed when it came to her becoming a homosexual.
This winner who twice received the Olympic copper prize has become a man of a high degree in the LGBT and used his position in the Commonualth Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to view it as a crime of homosexuality.
She said that she has spoken because she feels fortunate to be able to live without problems and wants to give others "hope."
This hero, who won three times in a global contest, said that he had a man - on - US film artist Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013 - "Come unexpectedly."
Daleley married and was given the Oscar prize, who left him 20 years ago, but he said that the passing year has not been a problem.
"When you experience so much of life as you are so young" - go to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it is hard to find a person like him who has had similar circumstances.
The two had a child in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Day, and Dayley said "He has changed his opinion."
"If you would question me last year, it was about ‘ I want to win a gold ring,' he said.
"You know, there are things more important than the Olympic gold rings.
My golden eagle of the Olympics is Robbie.
Her son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2012 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
She says that her father did not believe that he was going to die and that one of the last things he had told her they had got their tickets to London 2012 - since she wanted to be there.
"I couldn't say 'You can't be present in those games'," he said.
"I took him by the hand when he breathed his last and until he breathed his last and died where I saw that he was also a man like us," he said.

Mickelson has been sitting on a bench in the Rylader Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record Sunday when he plays his 47 Royal Cup game, but he will have to raise the taxis so that he will not be a cause for embarrassment.
Mickelson, who will be present at this event once in 12 years, is confined to a bench by Captain Jim Furyk on a day's baseballs and Saturdays.
Rather than being the lead, as he often takes the lead in playing for the United States, the winner has five times as a promoter and has worked in his sport in hopes of finding out what has happened to him.
Since it is not the ideal person to play the ball even though he has time for the game, this 48 - year - old player does not qualify to play the Le Gof National game, where the big game is usually a problem when playing a ball far away.
And if the place where you are to play is not so problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the ninth game on Sunday, will meet the British Swiss Molinari who has the ability to hit straight, who has played with the red Tommy Fleetwood in order to win their four games in the park.
If these Americans, who lose four points in the 12 games of one player, start the game well, Mickelson's game can be a decisive factor.
Foryk expressed confidence in his fellows, and he said nothing more.
"You have fully understood the role he has today, and he put me on my back and put me on his arm and said he would be ready for tomorrow," says Furyk.
"You have great self - confidence.
He is a famous athlete and has accomplished much in the past, as well as in this report.
I probably didn’t think of him playing two games.
I expected more, but that was what had happened and that was what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone else."
Mickelson will record history past Nick Faldo on the number of games he played in the Rylader Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game to the Rylands Cup that you have never compared with what you have accomplished as a player.
Mickelson has won 18 times, 20 was eaten and played alike, although Furyk says his presence has improved the group.
"It’s nice to be with him, you like to laugh, you like to make fun of people, and you’re a good person with him in a gang room," he explained.
“ I think young athletes have enjoyed being with him, and, in this week, it’s good to see you.
He does much more than just play.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that taking the most of the points doesn’t matter
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows that leading on a number of points when going to the last day of miracles to the Rylader Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
Dane played for the first time in 1997 in Valderrama, when a group with a premier Seve Ballestéros led five points over the Americans but finally went ahead in one point, winning for 1411,2-131.2.
"You always remind yourself that we were taking the lead in Valderrama; we led many points in Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderrama, where we won, but on a few points," says Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 salute of Kris in both Friday and yesterday to take the lead in 1066 in the Gulf National.
So history will tell me and everyone in the group that it is not over.
Do your best in the morning.
Make the best of your situation.
You have not finished the course until you have found the points.
We have a goal, and it is up to us to try to take the cup, and that is what we focus on.
I have said this long ago, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware that there are more to this group — the world’s largest players.
Thrilled with the way his players played in an awkward playground, Bjorn has added: "I will never reach the conclusion of this.
The future game is different.
In the morning it will decide how each player will play, and that is something different.
It’s good to go out with someone when things are going well, but if you are alone, then you are thoroughly tempted as a martial arts player.
That is the message you have to pass on to the players, that you do all you can to tomorrow.
Now, he leaves his partner behind and has to go and do all he can't do."
Unlike Bjordn, who competed with Jim Furyk will see that his players have played better alone than what happened when they were married, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three and four points.
Furryk himself can both eat and win on the last day at the last minute, since he has been part of the winning team in Brookline before he was fed when Europe was“ striking wonders in Medina. ”
"I remember it well," she always answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, urged his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be good to start with the top gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When that motivation and enthusiasm continue to mount, they put great pressure on the local games.
We organized our players in harmony with that and put our players in the way we thought, to enable us to practice magic in the morning.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to take the lead in fighting and coming back to the games and facing Roy McIlroy in the front of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, and other Europeans in the upper stage.
"I’m going with this group because I think it’s going to be ready for all the game," says Bjorn for selected players.
The German battleship has been reversed
A new type of German swimmer named Frigate had to begin operating in 2014 and replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be available until at least the next year because of Systems and the cost of bottleball, reports local news.
The "Rheinland-Palz," the new captain of the new ship Baden-Wuertteberg-class flagship, now edited in the first part of the 1920 ’ s, says Die Zeit newspaper quotes military speakers.
The ship had to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the quadruplets affected the future of the determined Project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertteberg-clas that were isolated by the Navy long ago will take the place of the Bremen-class ship.
It is understandable that ships will have heavy guns, types of land mines, and hidden technology, such as land mines, infractions, and noise.
Other important items listed include long periods of care that are impossible to use new ships until two years later in the port.
However, further undermines mean that the important development of warships - will give Germany power overseas - will be out of the time when they begin to work, says Die Zeit.
The ship whose future is to be lost F125 appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused the use of the ship and returned it to Blohmbnase Voss.
It was the first time that the Navy had returned the ship to which it was built after being brought.
Little is known about the reasons for being sent back to the ship, but the German press said that there was much more important about the technology and the warships that would make the warship useless if sent to the war.
Software problems were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertteberg-class ships are used by a group of 120-floor ships - which are part of the old Bremen's crew.
It also appeared that the ship has too much weight over what is needed to reduce its effectiveness and the possibility that Navy can put on things that will improve her in the future.
A unit of 7,000 "Rheinland-Palz" believes that it had twice as much of the same ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the Biblical problems, the total cost of the project - including training of a crew of sailors has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering $1.1 million ($3.6bn) - from the 2.2 million.
New ships' problems are very important, as recent warnings have been made that the German Naval power was down.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German head of a parliamentary committee, admitted to Navy that it was well ‘ caring for the discharge and passage of unworked ships. ’
The officer said that the problems grew to a degree in time, since the old ships were no longer working, but there are no ships working in their place.
You are disappointed that no ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas have been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust lives on the hidden path of bats
New research done in the Scottish Highlands area is intended to reveal how bats use the construction of the environment in their search for food.
It is hoped that the discovery will give us a better understanding of how these unique creatures survive and help to direct future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual singingpistrelles as well as Daubeton bats with long black ears at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in certain locations to check the services of bats throughout the year.
NHS workers and volunteers will make small surveys using hand-carts.
A reasonable analysis of all records will show the frequency of the calls of bats and what certain animals do.
A map of his residence and a report will be published to create a detailed picture of his home life.
Rob Dewar, the entomologist of the NTS wildlife reserve, hopes that the results will reveal which areas are most important to the bats and how these animals use.
This knowledge will help to see the benefits of the local work as a meadow Creation and the best way to preserve the habitats of bats and other animals related to these.
Scotland’s bats and all UK are rare throughout the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and maintenance of the environment and its losses.
Electrical appliances and lights can cause danger, and so can fly - and - away paper, antibacterial drugs, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not necessarily blind.
As they hunt at night, however, their ears are far more effective than their eyes when hunting the animal.
They use a sophisticated hearing system to locate the animals and the land I visit.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] in the whole country, considers it important for bats.
It has ten trained experts, who make regular checkups, to check his whereabouts and how to protect them.
The organization even arranged for the first Scottish island and its only bats on the Threes in Dumpries and Galloy, where eight of the ten species of Scotland bats live.
The local administrator, David Thompson, says that this is the best place to live.
"Here in Threave is the best place of bats," she says.
"We have old buildings, large trees, and good places.
But there is much about the bats we cannot, so the work we do here and other buildings will help us to understand more about what he needs in order to live."
He emphasizes the importance of checking the existence of bats before working on buildings because it is likely that destroying their one nest could kill some 400 females and possibly nearly all the residents.
bats are protected and the law does not permit to kill, torture, or disrupt or destroy their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species do not know what keeps them alive."
Ronaldo refuses charges of abuse as lawyers plan to issue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of the charges against him that he said he was "false stories," saying that people“ want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers planned to charge the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who had published these charges.
This Portuguese player and Juventus has been accused of abusing an American woman, whose name was Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room at Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid $375,000 to cover the situation, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Commenting on a video in Intagram Live and 142 million of his followers after the charges were reported, Ronalddo, 33 years old, concluded that it was “a false story. ”
"No, no, no, no, not, no no.
What they have said today is a false story," says an expert who has been recommended by the Ballon d'Or five times in the camera.
"They try to build a name for themselves by using the same name.
It is normal.
They wanted to be good names by calling on my name, but it is part of the work.
I am happy and all is going well for me, ’ adds the player, with a smile.
Ronaldo’s attorneys are ready to charge the Der Spiegel with these charges, calling them the "incurable report of complaints affecting personal life," says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Scchertz said that the player would seek a return of money to his dignity by the maximum number of charges against him, which is probably the most crucial thing to the violation of man’s recent rights.
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the lightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player’s room, where he is said to have gone there, according to documents placed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo was paralyzed after the incident and told her that "he is a good man" "99 percent" with errors "one percent."
The authorities said that Ronaldo had agreed to have sex, but they had agreed.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took pictures of those who had been wounded in the hospital, but later she admitted that the matter was dealt with outside the court because she feels "to retaliate" and is concerned about the“ social disgrace."
This 34 - year - old woman says that she now wants to change the contract as it continues to be damaged by what is said to be happening.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United when the charges were reported, and this year he was transferred to the great Italian party Juve in an agreement of £100 million.
Brexit: UK will always blame itself for the loss of car manufacturers
UK "will always regret" if it does not lose its position as a world leader in establishing cars after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He has also added "to worry" that Toyota UK tell the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a contract it will temporarily stop the product in its factory in Burmaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer said that the effect of delay when it happens to fail with Brexit can cause loss of jobs.
The Business of Burma - making Auris and Aventis of Toyota - produced about 150,000 cars last year and 90% were sent to other countries in the European Union.
"What I think if Britain comes out of EU at the end of March, the product will stand in our industry," says Marvin Cooke, the director of Toyota in Burkonton.
Some UK car manufacturers have feared the departure of the EU without a contract on how trade with other countries would work, including Rhonda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini industry in Oxford a month after Brexit.
What concerns most is related to what car designers call a risk if the Brexit agreements are not achieved.
The Toyota product is carried on by "at that time," and parts of cars arrive every 37 minutes from both UK and EU surgeons by means of radio cars.
If UK leaves the EU without a contract in 29 March, there may be interference on the side of which the industry claims can lead to drinking and to the end of car parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to catch more than a day built in their factory at Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may have to be stopped.
Mr Clark claims that a Chequers program for Theresa May future partnership with EU "orderly prepared to avoid that inspection from the border."
"We need to get a contract. We want to get the best agreement that will allow us since not only success we will enjoy now but also take advantage of this opportunity," telling the BBC Radio program the BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also from other firms is that we need to be completely able to carry on with the long - term endurance of the surgeons."
Tooota could not say how long the product will be stopped, but in time, it warns that the addition of expenses will reduce industrial efficiency and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsovallarris, who has worked in Burkinaston for 24 years and who is connected to the Unitate firm, says that his members are concerned: "From what I have seen if these activities are not returned.
A government spokesman says: “We have established a clear and reliable arrangement for our future relationship with the EU.
The Trump and Rosesenstein conference may be delayed again, says the White House
The red - forward gathering of the Donald Trump and the general lawyer Rod Rosenstein may be "subject by another week" as the high court war and the Brett Kavanough's installation continue, says the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of a special campaign by Robert Mueller, researching a Russian selection disorder, communication between Trump and Russia and possible misunderstandings from the president.
Whether Trump would expel the lawyer's assistant, thus endangering Mueller’s freedom, it has given Washington news about which to be discussed for months.
At the beginning of this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of cables to record discussions with Trump and the opportunity of the president being expelled by 25.
Rosesenstein has never forgotten the report.
But last Monday she went to the White House, although there are reports that she is about to leave her job.
Instead, meeting Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, is announced to be Thursday.
Trump said that the convention was too late to be avoided to conflict with the criminal judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of bullying, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both had become witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered that there be a check for a once-week of the FBI charges against Kavanaugh, further lowering the full voice of the Senate.
Trump journalist Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Sunday Sunday.
When asked about the convention by Rosenstein, he said: ‘ The day of what has not been laid up, or the day of the week, I think that this will be reversed in another week as there are other things going on with the high court.
But we will see and like to keep the news news informed."
Some journalists may disagree with this: Sanders had never held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The administrator, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders noted that the decline in these meetings does not result from the media's ‘ love of speech, ’ although he said, "I will not deny the truth that they speak."
He then points out that there will be a number of connections between Trump and the news media.
"The president made more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, adding without proving: "We have observed the figures."
There will still be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media get an opportunity to ask the president of the United States direct questions, that is much better than talking to me.
We try to do that many times and have seen it doing much in the past few weeks and will take place for a press conference if you are able to speak with the president of the United States. ’
Trump usually listens to questions when he came out of the White House or when he shares in the public squares or the press conferences with respected visitors.
It is not unusual for them to ask questions in private.
New York in this report the president likely pointed out why, taking no note and at times speaking thoughtlessly in front of the media.
The medical secretary writes to EU workers in Scotland about what Brexit is feared
The secretary of health has wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to show appreciation and worldly wishes to stay in post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter that remained 6 months before the UK had returned to the EU.
The Scottish Government is already obliged to pay the required fees for EU citizens who work in public assistance.
In his book, Msz Freeman wrote: “In summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued, looking at the expected decisions in the field.
However, the UK State has also been preparing its provisions for the absence of a treaty.
I know that this may not be a good time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work that all members of the staff, regardless of their nationality, are doing.
Our brothers from the EU, as well as from other places, bring a billion valuable pins and skills that strengthen and improve health services, benefiting the patients and the communities we work for.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."

International consumers will be paid for a large part of the system when they buy a UK home
Buyers from other countries will be paid a considerable sum of funds on the station as they buy a UK so that the money will be used to help the homeless under the new programs of Tory
This will make it difficult for Corbyn to get young people to vote
The rising cost of the station will be required for those who do not pay UK tax
Financialists hope to get about £120 million a year to help the homeless
Buyers from other countries will be paid for a better - quality building if they buy a house in UK - this money to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in attempting to lure young people into having more inexpensive homes and to be looked after by those who have more paid.
The rising cost of a system will apply to people and businesses that do not pay UK tax, and this additional amount will help in the government’s effort to eliminate homeless people.
This additional amount is added to the present pregnancy cost, including high - tech television placed in two years ago in second houses and at least 3 percent of the market.
Financialists expect this to give them about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London houses are purchased by non-UK residents, which elevates prices and makes it difficult for the first customers to find houses.
Most of the wealthy in the capital - in - law are now ‘ cities laid low ’ because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend much of their time away from the country.
A new goal comes after a few weeks that Boris Johnson spoke of the reduction of the line’s rent to help more youths get the original houses.
Reject building businesses by keeping up the number of high houses by replacing the building and not using them, and urge Nkkz May to close the Quatas in the houses that are purchased to repair the British "hatter of houses.
Mr Corbyn has announced a dramatic series of changes that are imagined in houses, including the management of rent and the removal of the house "inexperience".
He also wants to provide the fuel for the greater construction of new homes.
“ Last year I said I would devote myself to restoring Britain’s dream - that life should be better for each new generation, ” said Mrs.
And that means repairing the sale of houses.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work, and build lives here.
However, it would not be easy for UK people, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses than for British hardworking citizens.
For most people the dream of having a house is an impossible thing, and the lack of sleep on the street never ends.
Jack Ross: ‘ My greatest wish is to be a Scottish instructor'
Sunderland Captain Jack Ross says that the "great desire" has to be a Scottish instructor one day.
Ross, aged 42, desires the challenge of helping the North-East group, now the third of the League One, is left with three points by the upper class.
You have moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirran return to the Scottish Premiersh in the tribulation.
"I wanted to play my country as a player.
I received a B cap and it was finished," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I have often watched Scotland in Hampden, my father, when I was a child, and have been thinking about it.
I would have only that opportunity, however, if I succeeded as the instructor of a small group.
Pre - Ross tutors in Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, an instructor of Alloa Athens, said that he did not hesitate to enter behind the principal tutors in this large group, since he had refused requests from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success in the meantime will be determined whether I can return this group to the Premier League?'
As a result of the formation of the team, no doubt it should enter the Premier League," she says.
"It’s not easy to get back, but I will probably consider myself successful where I can return the group."
Ross has been a tutor for only three years, after a short period of training in Durmberton and 15 months as a training worker for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa escape from the body, and turned the St Mirren that was probably eaten by the mouse into the Champonship masters at the next station.
And Ross says he feels more confident now as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Foralkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"But things changed completely," you remember, by training Alloa.
"I was absolutely convinced that the training work was better for me, than for a player.
It sounds hollow because I played well, was healthy, and there were some things I enjoyed.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to pressures and pressures on the job, but I like training.
I have been looking for training and now doing it, knowing that now I am doing what I want to do with the rest of my life as an adult. ’

High point time by 5.30pm on Saturday, which is the assessment
The summer entrance has broken down Britain’s hard - drawn tubes but has made it difficult for restaurants.
Pangs and dummys increased by 2.7 percent in July - but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, says figures.
Peter Martin, of socialism consultany CGA, which has received these figures, says: "The continued success and presence in England is expected for World Cup means that July has followed a course similar to the previous month of June, when tubes rose by 2.8 percent, except that the restaurants cry down.
The 1.8 percent falling in sales at restaurants in June has become worse for July.
Drinking and bingo pools are more commercial than restaurants.
The tubes sell food that is too heavy in the sun, although it has never been as bad as eating shops.
It seems that people who wanted to get rid of themselves were going to get a drink.
In the lungs and bars the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in this month, the food dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a researcher on entertainment and hospitality to visitors of RSM, says: “The results continue to go on with what we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the outcome of major events or sports events will always be powerful reasons when it comes to market sales.
Not surprisingly, fast - food stores continue to be very tempting, although sales have dropped by 4.8 percent each year will suffer pain despite ongoing financial problems.
The long summer is very bad in the food markets, and in time it will be seen that the low temperature we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in the sale of popps and restaurants, including newly opened stores, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating the decline of the BBrren.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's commercial industry industry, the UK tables and food stores, collects and analyzes the operating chart of 47 working groups, producing more than £59 million, and is the beginning of a developing industry.

ELIdh Doyle will be a "word" on the Scottish Athens board
Eliidh Doyle has been selected by the Scottish Athens board as director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a popular Scottish athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described this action as a fine opportunity for those who organize sports to benefit from his large team in international sports ten years ago.
"Eiddh is highly respected throughout Scotland, UK and all players in the world, and we are sure that Scotland’s sports will benefit greatly by bringing him to board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I’m determined to be a player's voice and hope to contribute too much and to help organize games in Scotland."
This American player, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his four Olympic medals and is now a common bBC, found himself unable to walk after death (TIA).
He wrote to Twitter: "Last month I died this way.
I was unable to walk.
The doctors said that in time it would be clear to me whether I would get better or not.
If I had to struggle to get well, I learned to walk, and today exercise!
Thank you for encouraging me! ’
The advertising of breast - feeding that compares mothers with cattle creates a separation from the Internet
The breast - feed company created a break on the Internet by a declaration that compares mothers to cattle.
In order to mark the entry of the so - called first - worn breast pump in the world, the Elvie client’s company has produced a degrading video - video to show freedom from the new lung that gives breast - feeding mothers.
Four mothers play a song on a cattle boat with the words: "Yes, I am mute, but you don't see the tail" and say, "If you have not seen this is not my nose, my breasts."
The proverb says: "Take the cup out of the cup and put it out, and give it to the children, and take it out, take it out of the way, and give it to my friends."
However, this advertisement, published on the Facebook Web site of this company, has created a controversy on the Internet.
This video with 77,000 watching and hundreds of compartments has come up with differing views from observers, where many claim to look down on the "battle" of the milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise the product.
As we do need to get pregnant and give birth to give up milk, unless their babies are taken after a few days after birth," writes another.
Elvie's tiller lung entered and was hidden inside the nursing bran (Elvie/Mather)
Another said: ‘ It is a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But why don't you use it to advertise with a breast gun the mothers who are not able to keep their children?
Another said: ‘ This is not a fairy tale. ’
Some protected the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she had found the song “it’s fun."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I gave it to me.
The pumping made me feel like a bull.
The advertisements are cruel, but I have heard what they mean.
This product will be truly useful, ” writes another.
Another has read: “This advertising makes fun and refers to mothers who give presents (usually at work or in private homes) and feel like ‘ oxen. ’
This is not a publicity that glorifies or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video a group of musicians indicates that they have been dancing with hidden drums under their bra.
The objective of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breasts say that they feel like cattle.
But Elvie Pump, without sounds, has no ropes or tubes and wears it under the nursing bra, gives women freedom to move, handle their children, and carry them out.
Ana Balin, a member of the ECD of Mother, has noted: "Elvie Pump is a product that will have a significant effect on you so you would be qualified for the presentation in a clear way.
By comparing nursing women to cows we wanted to put the milk in the open with all its challenges in the public, while it illustrates in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of freeing the new lung to bring it.
This was not the first time Elvie pump was questioned.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from the mechanic Martha Javowski using this product.
Hundreds of native children moved peacefully to a tent camp across the Texas border
The number of children taken from foreign children has risen even though it has not changed the monthly number of passing the border, partly because the strict police installed by Trump has made it difficult to give children who do not support.
Often, many supporters become unregistered immigrants, and they have been afraid to put their chances of living in this area by pretending to be a parent.
The danger came to a head in June, when the authorities announced that supporters and other adult members of the home would have to send notes of fingers and that the date would be given to the local authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, director of the Immmigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted before the Congress that the party had arrested many people who had written to support children without their parents.
The criminal entity later admitted that 70 percent of those who were arrested had no crime cases.
"About 80 percent of the nonprofits or family members deal with this illegal practice, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue looking for those people," says Mr. Alverence.
In an instant, the authorities have established new laws that will require some of them to appear in court during the month, not after 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to selter workers.
Many will come from the video conference, not literally, to request legal rights at a foreign college.
Those who are considered unsuitable will be caught off guard.
If children live long, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to a game or to try to escape, in accordance with cryter workers and postpartum reports in the past months.
The lawyers say that this concern is growing at a larger center such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child’s severe pull may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They also add that moving children to a tent city without taking time to get emotionally ready for themselves or from friends can cause many of the problems they already have.
Syria tells the U.S., France, and Turkey's "explosive" to withdraw quickly
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Minister Walid al-Mouleam spoke to the refugees of Syria to return home, even though the war in their country is now eight.
Mouleam, again the prime minister’s assistant, said that the foreign troops of Syria were illegally, that they would put an end to terrorism, and that they would be ‘ treated properly. ’
"He must walk immediately," and tell the audience.
Moulem maintains that the ‘ war against terrorism is about to end ’ in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle and cleanse the whole area of Syria" in terrorist groups and“ anyone who comes from another country."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are heavily involved in training and organizing the Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 veterans in war - ravaged countries.
As for the refugees, Moulem said the circumstances allow them to return, and he blames the "Some western countries" by "fearing them" so that the refugees no longer return.
He said, "We have spoken to the international community and the public welfare organization to ensure that the refugees are returning."
"They promote politics on a matter to be dealt with only by the social welfare of the people."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not help her Syria again until a political treaty was established between Assad and the opponents of war.
The UN agents say that a recent treaty between Russia and Turkey to form a border on the last great Idlib apostasy is the opportunity to advance with political debate.
The Russian treaty and Turkey have prevented the massive invasion of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mouleam insisted that the agreement "has been set for a definite time" and hope that the soldiers will attack the Nustra Front fighters who compete with Al-Qaeda, "they will not be destroyed."
UN Secretary Staffan de Mistuura hopes that he will soon arrange the first meetings of a new committee that includes government and opposing members to write a code after the Syrian war and set up a choice.
Moulem has placed restrictions on the hand of the Syrian government on the committee, saying that the tax work should be kept only by ‘ checking the contents of the new constitution, ’ and warned of a move.
Why will Trump win the second time?
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second choice in 200 unless, as many regular observers may wish to be so, dishonest and do wrong that would replace him as president.
No doubt that ‘ It will be the most outstanding conclusion in the history of the president! ’
So far, there is no sign that observers are tired of the matter.
Since 2014, CNN watchers have doubled to 1.5 million, and the MNNBC has tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News usually has 2.4 million spectators, ranging from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Sow" is ahead of many 3.5 million observers in hot night news.
"People are curious because it is not something we understand," says Neal Baer, director of an ABC drama drama drama called "Designed Survivor," concerning the Cabinet secretary who serves as president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, who is red in the writing field, has another idea.
You remember to return a text to Boston prior to the 2016 option.
The driver told him he was going to vote Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because you make me laugh," says Mrs. Scovell.
It’s wonderful to listen to and see them.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. If long ago, whether families of immigrants are reunited and there is a global economy.
Very few people are aware of this.
And, rather than being an informed citizen if you find yourself sitting for more than six hours watching a news channel contradicting the use of Bob Woodward in his book "A deep background" in his book "Faar," Paul Nabart’s leather cover covering cost $15,000 (a costly," The Washington Post) and the graphic description of the Stormy Daniels examined Mr. Trump.
I, for my part, would not view Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of the things he does make it seem that it’s a great deal of human life, that you give something every night," says Brent Montgomery, director of the Wildlife Entertainment and founder of the "Pawn Stars," dealing with the changes in the Trump system and the daily discussion of the N.F.L., to praise King Jong-un.).

It was unlikely that he would depart from before it, as Brett Kavanough faced the Senior Judicary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember the times when we make all these smooth programs and people say, "This is the beginning of the Western civilization," says Mr. Freiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seemed that they were right."

The amount of money is placed in the selection of the period between the House contest
Not surprisingly, the 17th of the 17th is found to be a large sum of money, due to the reinterrence of the concentric provinces, which came out with two officers in the same competition with the same seat.
This newly painted Pitsburg region puts him in the contest Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in one particular circuit in the spring last year.
Lamb competes with another riot, the Republican Keith Rothfus, which now represents the old province of Pennsylvania, which extends fully to the 17th youth.
The cards were rewritten after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old provinces violated the law by stealing votes to the Republicans.
The contest in this new 17th issue has removed the financial competition between the members of the major team, the Democratic Campional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Camp Committee (NRCCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special choice on March that was watched by many people in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position had been held by the Republican for more than a decade, President Donald Trump won the district by 20 seconds.
The politicians gave the Democrats a measure of opportunity.
U.S. considered punishing El Salvador with support for China, and then dismissed
The disclomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noticed Beijing, with little supplication from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free conference with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and attended a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department have decided to call back on the American capitals of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama about the "modern resolution not to deal with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, who spoke for the door, says so at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador is paid, for $140 million by assisting America in 2017, and to control narcotics, development and economic support.
A fixed fee, which includes financial reductions and lists restrictions regarding injuries, could cause pain in Central America because of the increase in unemployment and murder.
As their meetings progressed, North America and Central America’s officials postponed a high bride - price focused on protection and economic development in order to follow the same gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But during September, the superior authorities made it clear that they wanted the bride - price to continue, effectively ending any idea of paying El Salvador.
President Mike Pance’s assistant should now arrange to speak to the conference, now arranged to be in the middle of October, as a symbol of the meeting, said the authorities.
And three American representatives returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new commands or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the arguments explained by three American officials, including two messengers, who agreed to discuss internal motives in a private state of secrecy.
Their accounts are confirmed by an external interpreter close to the rulers and spoke of a confidential state.
A History Lesson
The following case may be the report of Robert Mueller's special counselor against Mr. Trump's justice, and now there is solid evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to have examined whether Mr. Trump was connected with Russia in its efforts to challenge our choice.
If the Congres changes, Mr. Trump will find himself facing charges in this body, as he is preparing to stand before people who will vote, and perhaps finally in court.
This has many factors, and I do not mean that Mr. Trump’s fall will surely occur or that of his colleagues in Europe.
There are decisions all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German authorities tried to stop the coup d "état against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
It failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed bloodshed.
History revolves around such events, and the endless efforts to fight the will of the majority get stronger or worse.
The Americans are now exposed to many of these realities.
What will we do if Mr. Trump expels Dewty Attorney General Rosenstein, Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein, who had been in trouble with the paper, reported that last year, she suggested secretly registering the president and mentioned her failure to perform his duty.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times story is not accurate.
"How will we react if the new F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh survey is incomplete or unjust - or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court in spite of sexual harassment and lying?
And above all, will we vote in the middle age of the Congress to blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the will of the majority will not be realized for a long time.
But I believe we will never fail, thanks to a study I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew exiled to Auschwitz, the same Nazi regime that had ruled my place.
She survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, sent me to light candles on the Sabbath at a gastika table.
Having this as an inheritance, how is it possible that I have no hope for our future?'

Graham Dorrans of Ringers hope as the game approaches the Rapid Vienna
Ringers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to pass through the Group G of European League.
The injury on the knee prevents the late Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in the agony until it was equal to 2-2 with Villarreal but believes that Ringers can use those results to look forward to the big things.
"It would be nice to find out this point because Villarreal is a good team," says this 31 - year - old player.
"We’ve gone to the game and believe that we’ll have something back and get the point.
We may have found a bicycle at the end of it but, otherwise, to play equally well.
They played better than we were with us on the first stick, and the second was our best.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
It is hoped that we will get three points but that it will be a difficult game because they have played well in the previous game but, as our followers will be encouraging, I am sure we will play and have good results.
Last year the hardship was over, during all the events of my injuries and changes in the team itself but it seems that things will be right now.
The team is good, and the players are happy; they also enjoy training.
We hope that we will work now, past the tribulation, and succeed.
Women cannot sleep because they are afraid of the financial cost of living
Despite having a clear vision of how they want to be cared for, few have spoken to their family about it.
Nearly half of the world’s population report talking to their spouse about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children about it.
"People want to take care of a family member, but they don’t take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, president of the Nationalwad's insurance business.
Let this start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to look after you and your loved ones if you do not tell them about your wishes.
Work with your guide and family to discuss how and where you will be looked after, for such decisions can have a powerful impact on how you view them.
Here is your financial guide: Your counselor can also help you to make a living.
Your long - term budget decisions may include a long - term insurance policy, a life - insurance policy that pays with money if you make a contract to pay for these expenses or become a health insurance policy, as long as your health is not available.
Adjust your legal requirements: Hide the wars of the law.
Find a health - care program to appoint a trusted person to care for your treatment and to make sure that your wishes are backed up if you are not able to speak.
Consider, too, the power of attorney on your bills.
You will choose someone you trust to make decisions for you about your money and make sure that your expenses are paid if you are not able to do anything.
Do not forget the details: Imagine your aged parent suffering from an emergency and being rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and disease?
Write down the information in an orderly way to prepare for the situation.

National prosecutors sought an unprecedented death sentence for the NYC terrorist attacks
New York Governmentists sought the death sentence of Sayfillo Saipov, the target of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people; an unusual sentence that has not been released from this area since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a hired Home Depot to attack on the way to the West Side Side Higgway in Lower Manhattan, and to kill pedestrians and bicycle drivers on the same route in October.
In order to bring him to a death, the persecutors will have to show that Saipov had killed eight people and that he had been ‘ willfully wounded in the body, in accordance with the announcement of a death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both activities carry the burden of a death sentence, in accord with the court order.
After some weeks, the question court sentenced Saipov to 22 charges involving eight murder cases, which are usually used by state prosecutors in organized criminal cases, and the case of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack called for "order and good judgment," the prosecutors said, explaining how Saipov did so as to say "it is cruel, and it is horrible."
"Syphillo Habibulavic Saipov has injured, killed the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Dra, Arreel Erlij, Hernan Ferrach, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dagn Pagnuo" said the court report.
Five killed were visitors to Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the New York Southern District ended up handling the death sentence.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug workers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The time that the death penalty was ended in New York’s case was 1953 in Julius and El Rosenberg, married people who were executed after being convicted were responsible for sharing information between the Old War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed that he did not have a heart in the days and months following the attack, according to court officials.
He told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done, that the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been in this way to watch the SS videos on his phone, in accordance with the words he had spoken on the side.
She also asked to be hung by the SS flag in her hospital room, as the police said.
She said she had no part in her 22 sides.
David Patton, a social security officer representing Saipov, says that they are "insolent as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than accept a prison sentence without the time of release will only make it easy to be shocked in these cases for all involved," says Patton.
The Saipov panel had asked the prosecutors not to accept the death penalty.
Toy Procedure Procedure Prostates and Brexit
Nigel Farrage vowed ‘ to organize the community' today during the campaign at the Tory Council.
A former Ukip leader said that politicians had to ‘ suffer ’ by Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa’s ministers said it should be the one who should preside over talks with the EU.
A senior member of parliament Peter Bone told the critics at Birmingham that UK ‘ may now have gone out' if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Nkkz faced in unifying members of his separate group is noted by the older Tory members who joined a different protest against Brexit in the city.
General fails to maintain his Chequers order to run successfully despite the attacks of Brexit, Remainer and EU members.
Some members have insisted that they will continue to try to make an agreement with Brusels in spite of the conflict there has been - and have forced the Eurosceptics and Labours to choose between his field and the dispute.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Live in Solihull that you want to ‘ finish with Chequers'.
He said that Mr Farage should be made a pillar and given the job of communicating with Brussels.
'If it had been the one in charge, we would have gone out now,' he said.
This Westlingührer has added: ‘ I will represent Brexit but we need to end with Chequers.'
Describing his differences with the EU, he says, 'We have not fought the wars of the world to become slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone concluded that public opinion has changed since the vote of 2016: ‘ The idea that the British have changed the mind and that they want to remain far from the truth is far from true.'
Andrea Jenkyns of Tory who supports Brexit was also in the contest, telling the cooks: ‘ What I say: My grandma, listen to the people.
'People don't want Chequers, the opposition group won't vote, our group doesn't want our people to see us walking on the streets and make us vote from the beginning.
Please forget Chequers and start listening.
In a straightforward message to Nkkz May, he said: 'The elders continue to perform their duties if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the politician in the debate that they must be ‘ pressed' if they forget the decisions they made on the 16th board.
‘ This is now a matter of loyalty between us - people - with our political class, ’ he said.
‘ They try to be dishonest with Brexit and we are here today to tell them that ‘ we will not just let you do that.'
And in a mighty command he spake unto the people, saying, I will make thee a political class, which are now threatened with Brexit, and shall feel troubled.
‘ By means of the society of the world that has made us victorious in Brexit and will not grow weary to become a self - independent, self - independent, self - centered, the proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers rioted in Birmingham before having a two - hour call in the city.
The chief executive officers were carrying posters entitled Tories Against Brexit after the group was set up in the check.
Labour's member Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservives for the safety problems they had with the group's tape at the opening session.
‘ These are people who tell us that they can put the IT's classes and all the technology of Canada and, a safe line, free trade without limits and Ireland, ’ which adds.
‘ It is total destruction.
There is no such thing as a beautiful Brexit, which adds.
Warren's programs for monitoring to enter the president's option
The U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says "to watch for the election of the president" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of its future in a city hall on the west side of Massachusetts on Saturday.

The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to finding a cleansed earth after following the group's directions that have enabled him to gain mastery over Sebastian Vetusel
It became evident when Valtter Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the guidelines of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the contest.
From the beginning, Bottas had a good start and was likely in conflict with Hamilton as he had defended his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack a man of his group.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be stopped by car on the gang track, which should have been the determining factor.
Mercedes entered the pit after the turn and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of the race that made the Ferrari driver forced to leave the inside safe after two years of safety in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began in the second line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21st day.
He then takes the lead in a large part of the race as he has continued with his wheels so that he can finish quickly and pass Kim Rainkin to the fourth.
She has finally reached the pits in the 4th cycle but has not been able to raise her speed in eight rounds as Raikonen is the fourth.
The hard day because Vattterer did a good work all weekend and was kind and hospitable.
The group has done a commendable job with 1-2," says Hamilton.
His Body’s Exercises Wealth
President Donald Trump ridiculed the Senior Dianne Feinstein in a Saturday conference as he insisted that he did not show anyone a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on charges of Supreme Court Brett Kavanough against sexual harassment.
Speaking to an organization in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford before the Senior Judicary Committee, but noted that what happened to the Senate showed that people were "unreasonable and unkind and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the good that would continue a few days ago in Senate, if you see anger, when you see angry, unkind, unreasonable, and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the bad news and say "Oh, I haven’t done it.
I didn’t do it. ’
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, told someone?
Do you remember his answer... and someone sent him this statement - "oh, yes, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't sent anyone."
Well, wait one minute.
We have sent him... No, we haven't sent anyone," he said, referring to the star.
Finstein was sent to a book containing details about the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it came from the beginning of September - but Finstein denied that the party had come out of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford, I never sent anyone," Finstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it secret and have kept it as secret as I asked."
But his denial was not well understood to the president, who has noted during a Saturday evening gathering: ‘ This is what I can say, the movement of his body is to the rich.
He may not have done it, but his body movement is a rich man.
Continuing his defense against the Supreme Court, accused of rape by three women, the president said that Democrats used charges for their results.
"He is willing to fight for the power of anything he can do.
You see the lack of kindness, indifference, concern about who is injured, whom they should pass to govern and control," reports the Mediterranean according to the president's statement.

Clean water does not come easily.
Stores are searched everywhere.
Jan Gefand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia has helped survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a disaster, but it can be even worse.
The Indonesian President Joko Wiko came to Palu on Sunday and told the international army: "I ask all of you to work day and night so that you can complete all the work in connection with human removal.
Are you ready? You can save the CNN.
Indonesia has been attacked earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people have died.

The publishers of Paddington were afraid that the students would not like this burning file, revealing the newspaper
Bond's daughter Karen Janekel, who was born after the book was approved, said in a letter, "It is hard to put yourself in the shoes of the person who reads it before it is printed.
It is a pleasure to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
He says that his father, who had worked in BBC as a photographer before being moved to write a child’s book on a small toy bear, would not be disappointed if his work was not appreciated, he added 60th anthnissary to his printing of his books was "paid and happy" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, he described it as "the quality of our most important family," and added his father to his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he wasn't proud of himself," he told them.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had a child accomplished something: you took pride in it even if you didn’t work.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Even though he was invented and thought by him, he always praised Paddington.

A woman types cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in death worked side by side to prevent others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been doing this on the Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use to get help.
Nksz Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," says Mrssz Davis.
Msz Davis, a 45 - year - old who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook and that when everyone was smiling, everyone was smiling.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They kept saying that it was all right there with him.
Nevertheless, she left her job before she died, as she was very depressed.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the first to meet her after suicide.
“ I’m always worried about something that’s about to happen, ” said Mssz Davis.
Mssz Davis began making cards, "To make it clear to people that they can talk to, even if they can be friends.
Do not bottle up your feelings — you have to talk.
Msz Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, died for Mark, his 15 - year - old brother - in - law, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say you feel down or depressed or say anything," he relates.
“ A few days before Christmas we noticed a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was lower in one way or another — when children opened their presents without looking or doing anything.
He said that his death was a terrible blow to them, but they had to deal with the problem: “It leaves a big void in the family.
It hurts us a lot.
But all of us must continue to fight.

The future of Brett Kavanough is not assured as the FBI starts searching
"I thought, if we really could find something like what they were looking for - a quick search - not - it can bring a critical confrontation," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "divided" as many do not agree.
Why do Mr Kavanaugh and his Reblican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
What they lack is time.
The middle term of the period will reach five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans are unsuccessful, then they will be weakened in their efforts to find a person selected from the highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling on the Snators, encouraging them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and there met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr Bush.
What happens when the FBI has released its report?
There will be a Senate selection, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get about 50 votes from Senate, which will allow Mike Pance, the vice president's rudder, to divide the equality and place him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's opponents 'will decrease' under Kim
The number of heretics in North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un began to reign seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Pack Yezeong-seug, quoting details of the South treaty, says last year 1,127 - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mu Park says that border rules have been enforced between North Korea and China and the high cost required by secretly recruiting workers has a major impact.
Pyongangy noticed nothing in the community.
A large number of apostates from the North eventually obtained rights as citizens in South Korea.
The Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, with a long border to share with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the bordered Zone (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China views these apostates as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often brings them back into their countries by force.
The relationship between the North and the South are still in war in a sense has been remarkably developed over the past months.
Earlier this month, leaders of these two countries met in Pyongangy, principally discussing the development of nuclear arms discussions.
This took place after the June historic convention between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several means of working to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Minister R R Yong-ho blamed the US authorities for not taking action since.
"Without the trust of the US, there will be no hope for the safety of our country and under those circumstances, we will never close our own weapons first," says Mr Li in a talk to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "subjective," that she does not qualify to serve in the High Court
The head of the Small House Group Nancy Pelosi calls the one who may be selected by the Supreme Court Brett Kavanugh as "acute." He also said that his emotions do not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelos says these words in a Saturday conversation at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if a woman had done that way, it would be said that she was ‘ dominated by feelings,' and that Pelosi said in her reply to the words of Kavanaugh before the Senior simply Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied emotionally that he has hit Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at an early age.
In the midst of his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed his emotions, at least in part, as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against it "the man's ignorance of man in order to be executed in order to have him put to death." It was stated that Hillary Clinton was elected in the elections of 2016.
Pelos said he believed that the evidence of Kavanaugh shows that he would fail to serve in the Supreme Court, for it shows that he is against Democrats.
"I think he isn't worthy of those words and the way he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi refused when asked if he would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and Democrats obtained many seats from the House of Repreentantivives.
"This is what I'm going to say -- if I don't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, it means that he is not only qualified to the Supreme Court, but also to the present court, says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now Judge to D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat is concerned that Kavanough may judge against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is thought to be the judge responsible.
When questioned, Kavanaugh did not answer the question of whether he could answer some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"This is no time for an emotional man, who takes sides to court and is expected to say, 'It was OK,' Peter says.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Power.
Proper reprimands, months, and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to shed tears.
"We cry when we are upset," Mrs. Steinem told me that 45 years later.
"I don’t think that’s unusual, what do you say?"
She added, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a bit critical, who said she was crying when she was upset, but she found a suggestion that when she got upset and cried, she would say to her person, "You may think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I am angry.
Then he proceeded.
And I think that’s good."
Tears come out as a way to let go of anger because they need people very much.
One of my earliest memories was of the work, an office full of men, when I found myself crying over the anger that I could not describe, I was pulled from the badly hurt neck that I had been repeatedly dragged to the stairs.
"Be careful that they don't see you cry," he told me that.
"They don't know that you’re upset.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have found you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic steppeswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his choice.
In 1982, when Mr. Hart was caught in adultery in a ship called the Money Business and was discharged from the choice, Mssz. Schroeder, in anger, saw that he could not fulfill his desire to enter the choice as president.
"It wasn't a well - thought - out decision," he said that to me he had laughed 30 years later.
"There are already seven other players in the race, and the ridicule is waiting for the other.
One is called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was about to end the campaign, she had no money for the job, so she vowed that she would not enter the race until she had earned $2 million.
It was a battle I could not overcome.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 million from men could give him $250.
"They think I’m getting a break?" she wondered.
While declaring that he would not perform a organized campaign, he was overwhelmed with feelings of appreciation for people who had supported him, the frustrations of a system that made it difficult to get together money and recruiters rather than looking for members, and resentment over the discrimination of women.
"You would think I was entering," recalls Mrssz. Schroeder and how the media responded to him.
"You can imagine that Alex will be a helicopter.
I remember thinking, ‘ What will they put in my grave? ’
"You've cried"""
How trade between the US and China can be beneficial in Beijing
The salvos that opened the war between the US and China were deaf, and since the war is still far from the end, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the future, say experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued the first warning early in the year by introducing shipments to China, including electricity, iron, and aluminium.
The largest event took place in this continent with the new multibillion - dollar radio stations, producing half of all supplies in the US from China.
Beijing has returned each time in the same way, recently setting up 5 to 10 percent of American goods worth $60 dollars.
China has asked for the equivalent of the US, and the second largest worldwide economy has little chance of falling nearby.
To reduce Washington immediately means to close the corner with its requirements, but openly bending to the US would be a great shame for XI Yinping, the president of China.
Even so, researchers say, if Beijing can act wisely, the pressure for the US war to trade with it can reap China for a long time by reducing both trades.
"The fact that an urgent political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that can cause economic problems in both countries is far more dangerous than observers have previously seen," says Abigail Grace, a leading researcher in Asia at the Centre for New American Security, the mental center.
Syria 'is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister.
Syria claims to be ready to return to the refugees and seek help to rebuild a war - ravaged land for seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Wolid al-Mouleam says that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation in this area is calm and safe because of the progress made in fighting and terrorism," he says.
The government continues to repair damaged areas to restore normal life.
All the circumstances now allow the willing return of refugees to the country to which they had to flee because of terrorism and the biased economic systems that attacked their daily lives and life - style.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrias have fled from this since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in this area are in need of living support.
Al-Mouelam has said you can enjoy the relief of rebuilding a war - torn country.
But he stressed that they could not accept help or help from countries where they advocate rebellion.
