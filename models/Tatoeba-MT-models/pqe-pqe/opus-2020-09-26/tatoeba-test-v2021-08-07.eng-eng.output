yesterday, I met a man who knew that was ours.
yesterday I met a man who knew Tom.
I am Europe.
I am absolutely sure that it will not happen.

I was sure Tom had siblings.
I’m sure Tom would pass the test today.
I am quicker than you are.
I’m fat.
I am from Erbil.
I am from South America.
I am from the United States.
I’m glad I didn’t buy one.
I am glad that I did not.
I am glad that I left Australia.
I was glad that everyone around me was so happy.
I am happy that all the people were injured.
I am glad that Tom was not injured in the accident.

I’m glad to hear it!
I am glad that Tom did not see matou.
I’m glad Tom made the decision to do so.
I’m glad Tom was caught.
I’m glad to see Tom again being happy.
I’m glad we left early.
Happily, though, you did not tell Tom anything about it, and that could have added to your surprise.
I’m glad you decided to do so.
I am a fool.
I will be about 30 in October.
I’m going to work.
I am grateful for your help.
I hope that I will be given a second chance.
I hope I can live with you.
I hope it has.
I hope things will improve once I’m gone out of love.
I was scared.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
I miss you when you are around.
I was shocked like everyone else.
I’m here to visit.
I’m Korean.
I am learning Old English.
I am less optimistic than you do.
I look forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
I’m looking for you.
I’m still a better person.
I’m married, you’re married, I’m going to get married!
I am no longer hungry.
I’m not used to having such a meal.
I used to walk long distances.
I am very busy now as I have been in the last year.
I am not stupid, as Tom was.
I am not young as Tom was.
I was not surprised.
I don’t feel tired at all.
I am not a static person.
Little did I know that I needed to do so.
I was not sure that Tom could be trusted.
I was not convinced that I should do that.
You must cry out!
I am not fat.
I could not do that on my own.
I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you. ”
I don’t want to do anything about it.
I was sexually active.
It’s not that I am thinking.
I am not yet married.
I don’t plan to do that again.
I am very proud of my behavior.
I’m not saying that all of us should do the same.
I should not tell anyone about it.
Not sure, but I thought Tom would like to become a teacher.
I am not sure that I can do that.
I am not sure that I can win this battle.
I am not sure that I will help.

Now I can be sure that this will not happen.
I’m planning to send Tom a birthday.
I’m happy to meet you.
Tom is positive.
I think I could do that.
I guess Tom would do that.
To my surprise, Tom and Mary were both deceased.
