The members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about the similarity of \"Brief dolls\" (muppet) -
Some members of the Assembly are seriously concerned with the proposal to change their current rank on behalf of MWP (member of Parliament of Wales).
The issue arose because it is planned to change the name of the Assembly into Parliament of Wales.
Members of various political directions of the Assembly complain that they may become ridiculers.
One Labour member of the Assembly said his group concerned that “it nation will be Twp and Pwp.”
Non-Wales reader: twp in Wales means fun and pwp brace.
And one member of the assembly said, \"It was not happy, and it was presented several alternative names.
The Welsh Conservatives said that they “opened their minds to meet a new name, but they noticed that when they said that the MWP is very similar to the word Muppet (bliver doll television series in the UK).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed as u letter in English.
The Assembly Commission, currently working on the draft law on importing a new name, says: “The final decision on all definitions of the name of the Assembly, of course, is taken by the members themselves.”
By the decision of the Welsh Government in 2017 the Welsh Assembly received the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public review of options, where it gained extensive support for the Assembly to grant the name of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the rank of members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name “WPM” as a member of the Parliament of Wales, but the MWP option received more support during public discussion.
Members of the Assembly still choose alternative options, so achieving consensus will be the concern of the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to submit the bill of change within a few weeks.
The reform bill also includes other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the scheme of disqualification rules and committees for the members of the Assembly.
Members of the Assembly will make final decision on their name during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians hold a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday voters decide whether to get a country’s new name “Republic of Northern Macedonia”
The vote was appointed to be due to a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, because they also have a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbor has been pretending on this behalf in its territories and is constantly opposed to the share of his membership in the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, the opponent of holding a plebiscite for the name change, says that he will not pay attention to the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply a fee for accession to the EU and NATO.
The church bells of St. Martin were mutilated because churches in Harlem are difficult.
“The hundreds of people I’ve spoken say historically were bar and church,” said Mr. Adams.
“No one has ever done it today.”
He said it's clear the barbeque disappearance.
Today, “human relations are different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a place to gather neighborhoods, where neighbors are constantly walking.”
As for the churches, he fears that money from selling assets will not be as much as the leaders suggest, “and sooner or later they will find themselves in the place where they started.”
The churches can be replaced by cooperative residential buildings, where people who do not care about the temples remaining in the neighborhood have added it.
“The majority of the owners of these buildings will be white,” he said, “so they will accelerate the day when all these churches will be shut down, because the people who come into these cooperative buildings will not become believers of these churches.”
Both churches were built with white congregation before the black town of Harlem became the Metropolitan Church of the City Society in 1870 and the Church of St. Martin in ten years later.
The Congregation of the original white Methodists moved from here in the 1930s.
Nearby, the black congregation of the black canal gained the right to the building.
St. Martin's Church was a black Congregation under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who was led by a boycott against the main commercial district of Harlem, 125th street, traders who refused to hire and encourage the blacks.
The 1939 share of fires damaged the building significantly, but as the recovery plan developed by father Johnson's parish, bell call was also given to them.
Worthy David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor to this Carrillion was proud to call “the gut call of people’s bells.”
In July, Carrillion’s performer called him another name, “The Cultural Treasures” and “The Unchangeable Historical Instrument.”
Tiffany Nng, an expert from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was Dionysio A. Lindy, the world's first black musician, who moved to a larger plainion church by 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivelter said that the Church of St. Martin did not change it.
During the last months in the church of St. Martin, what was accomplished was a complex plan of architects and contractors, part of which was brought by the assistants of the church of Kapelani, by the Diocese of the rest of the Bishop.
The Council of the Council - the governing body of the Church, which consists of the helpers of Kapelan - in July, wrote the Diocesan with the concern that the Diocese \"was given the costs for the Council, even though the latter was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Part of the congregation expressed concern over lack of transparency of the Diocese.

“If everyone could get out of the water, I shouted, ‘The zigogen is in the water!’- added Hamel.
The boy was transferred to San Diego Radi children's hospital by helicopter, where his condition was critically assessed.
Unknown what kind was the attacker shark.
A few weeks ago, a shark was noticed in these areas, but it was said that the shark of this species was not dangerous.

The police banned the beach from Pontus beach for investigation and security for 48 hours from Kassadad to Ecinitas drinking beach.
Jill notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in these places, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s UK Cosmetics Market Breaks
In contrast to the Sainsbury's Boots, the Superdrug and Debenhams, the supermarket warehouse is supplied with cosmetics and offers the experts who help there.
2.8 billion pounds of cosmetic products are growing, while sales of clothing and household products are being lowered, the main distinctive element of attack on such market, cosmetic products supplied to the widest shelves of supermarket will be tested in 11 large stores of the country and in case of success will be added to more stores from next year.
Investments are made in cosmetics, as supermarkets hunt on the shelves that were once used for TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the list of proposed cosmetics before 3000 names, including brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Products already available from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands become even more diverse in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will re-launch its Boutique makeup products that do not contain animal origin products and will be acceptable for vegans, the demand for young customers on such products is rapidly increasing.
In addition, the perfume store Frogrance Shop will enter two Sainsbury's markets, one of which opened in London in the south of Croydon last week, and the second year will be opened in Birmingham's Selma again.
Online shopping and on a daily basis for buying goods in nearby small stores, the transition to buying food for supermarket owners forces to work more to earn visitors.
Mike Kupp, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the autlets would become very similar to the universities, as supermarket networks try to compete with Aldi and Lidl with frequent discounts by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos to hundreds of supermarkets, as well as a lot of Habitats two years ago after buying both of these networks, thus improving sales of food products and making purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt to transform the departments of his cosmetics and pharmacy facilities was unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s Sainsbury's, they tried to work together with Boots, but failed to agree on how they had earned income from their supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's has launched a new strategy three years ago for Lloyds Pharmacy network owner Celesio from 125 million pounds of 281 pharmacies.
Lloyds had to play its role in this plan by expanding skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four markets.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: \"We have changed our appearance and we have met customers with shelving full of cosmetics.
Also, specially prepared staff are ready to help.
Our list of brands responds to all requirements, while our attractive environment and convenient location is a serious competition to go shopping with ancient methods.

“We fell in love with each other after a difficult conversation”
He told her that news media would criticize her, some considered it \"not presidential, commentary, and would not approve such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.\"
Why does President Trump give so much?
You said Trump, \"The telescope, with an old voice.
“I didn’t drink anything.”
He noted that after the first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim was interested in the second meeting of North Korea's denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiators would be left behind.
Three months after the meeting in Singapore, North Korean chief diplomat Rich Hom told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see the “responsive response” to the actions of the disarmament that started in North Korea, the United States.
Instead, he added, the United States continues to sanction, aiming to keep tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his summarizing speech.
“Our affairs go very well with North Korea,” he said.
“The war with North Korea was expected.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his efforts to correct his relationship with Kim gave positive results - the end of the rocket test, the relief of the hostage, and the return of the remaining U.S. servants home.
Also, he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
“The presidential behavior is very easy, but instead of the 10000 people out there trying to enter the device’s arena, we have 200 people here,” said Trump, and directly pointed to the crowd gathered in front of them.
In Indonesia, tsunamis and earthquakes have destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
In order to determine the results of the Lobok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not required.
Although 10 percent of Lobok’s population is dismayed, national disaster has not been announced, which is a precondition for speeding international aid.
“In some cases, they have expressed themselves very clearly so as not to ask for international assistance, which is a little thought-provoking,” said Ms. Sumbun.
While Save the Children has been preparing a team to go to Palau, there is not yet some work whether foreign employees will work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, press secretary of National Disaster Service, said that Indonesia's state services value the situation in Palu in order to determine whether to allow international agencies to operate in their settlements.
In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, we can say that the country is completely unprepared for natural disasters.
In Ashish, you've built shelters for tsunami victims, but you're not going to see them in other regions.
As it turned out, the absence of a tsunami warning alarm in Palu, even though it was known about it, is one of the reasons for the high number of deaths.
In the United States, a number of islands in Indonesia are quite difficult to travel.
Natural cataclyses make transportation even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was arriving in Lobok for the treatment of earthquake victims in Palu, would go to Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the location of a new disaster.
President Joko Uedo spent most of his electoral program on improving the spread of Indonesia infrastructure and invested lots of money in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joco's administration failed funding problems, because next year, he had a re-election.
The confrontation between Mr. Joco and Confess has a problem in Indonesia, where most Muslim members are followers of the most conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, and tens of thousands of their homes have been disillusioned by the streets of Machetes, adoptions, and other weapons.

In the English civil wars, Cromwell did not command and held to fight traditional beliefs.
There might be another crommite punishable for the actions his ancestor Thomas committed in the last century.
Sir William by Thornicroft’s wonderful work is a wonderful confirmation of the 19th century attitude towards Cromwell and is part of the historiography of the person who, by the opinion of many, still belongs to appreciation.
The Sunday Telegraph said: “It may be more in the second half of the 19th century than today, but still many Cromwell views it as the defender of parliament at the time of the monarch’s attack.
Historical debates about how accurate this idea is still
One of the things that can be said to be true is that in the 17th century, the conflict gave rise to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell was an important part of the division of one side.
His, as a Lord Defender, achievements also deserve a celebration and honor.

A few hours later, the cable and broadcast networks were handed directly to the legal committee when the vote had to be held for the Kawano candidates for the entire Senate.
But the flute said, I'll do it only if I know the FBI will study the charges against the candidate in the next week that the minority of Democrats has expressed.
The flute was partially convinced by his friend, senator Chris Cun.
After talking with a few other sensors, the flute decided.
The choice of flutes had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not vote without investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation to find out allegations against Kavano.

Mengas goal brought 1-0 victory with the Livingston Reinger
The first goal of Doli Menga brought Livingston to victory
Livingston, the previous one, prompted the Ranger to be given to Stephen Gerard in 18 games only because of losing the second one for Ibrox Club.
Doll Menga's goal has proved to be a difference, with Harry Holt's team moving to the second level with Hiberian.
Gerard's team remained in the Premier League without winning this season, and then they meet the leader Harts on Sunday, which they win with eight points.
Before that, Reingers hosts Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his undefeated move to the division, with a main coach not yet winning a match with a Holt in the past month after the change of Kenya Miller.
Livingston failed to use odds with dune guests
The Holti team had to advanced long before the goal was scored, their direct play in all zones had a problem with the reinger.
Scott Robinson ran well, but in front of the door, the shot was spoiled, then Alan Letgou was able to strike a head shot along the creek Holkit door only to the door.
The hosts were happy to give the Ranger the opportunity to play them ahead, knowing that they could create problems with the guests after the game was updated from standard situations.
And it was a tactic where the decisive ball went out.
The Knights gave free shots and Levingston worked at the opening, Declan Galaher and Robinson joined Menga to provide a touch to score the goal out of the penalty centre.
At that point, the Ranger had the advantage of possession of the ball, but the defense of the opponent was inexhaustible, and the keeper Lee Kelly did not create any problems.
Such a situation continued in the second half, but Alfredo Moreellos struck him and the door was saved by Kelly.
The keeper of Scott Pittman was hit by Alan McGregor on foot, and was also hit by Lithgoum while playing another standard state of Liwingston.
They constantly took the ball out of the Livingston penalty area and were always out of the penalty area, although two penals were appointed after replacing the Holkyt with Glenn Midlton and the second hand for the game - both missed the door.
'Phenomeral' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alander Lamont Tony Papa Arena
The phenomenal game and result of Livingston.
All as one, brilliant player, constantly exceeds expectations of this ascending trajectory.
Their game style and composition have changed significantly since they returned to the High League, but special thanks to the Holt for putting the team into the warehouse after its arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Holkit was impassable, head of the highest organized defense, while Menga never gave Connor Goldson and Joe Urall.
Also, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They're sometimes very good at the guidance of Gerard, and this time they've lacked a lot of it.
Their final ball couldn't be scored - only once a team of hosts broke -- it's time the Ranger woke up, they were in the middle of the table.

The police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but the total number of supporters was gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants opposed by Erdogan -- including many Kurdish -- also tried to make their voice heard, criticize Erdogan's policy and decide to invite the German government to his country.
The duel protest is expressed by a different attitude towards the guest, the German Turks call it a hero, while the other is called an autocrat.

The storm of Rosa threatens Finnx, Las Vegas, with sudden floods of Solt Lake City (it can be useful in the wet areas)
Tropical depression is rarely overstrain, but at the beginning of the next week, this is what happens, because the energy remaining in the windstorm is moving on the desert west, which is likely to lead to sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already announced a sudden water stream observation on Mondays and Tuesdays in Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Uta, as well as in cities of Finix, Fragstaff, Las Vegas, and Solth Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will directly take Gess in the direction of Finix on Tuesday, with rain approaching late Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix Twitter notes that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 km from Finnx after 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm of about 40 miles from the range of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Center for Chauffeur are suggesting a poem from 2 to 4 duem, with isolated amounts from 6 dummies in the Mologon Rim.
In other parts of the Udabic South West, including Central Rock and Grit Basin, it is likely to be 1 or 2 inches, whereas the total isolated area can be up to 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of sudden floods, rose rains can be useful because the region is very droughty.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some heavy rains will likely be beneficial because the South West is now under drought.
From the United States drought monitor service, Arizona's 40 percent is under extreme drought, the second highest category says weather.com
The storm of roses is going to Mexico on the Bay California Peninsula.
Rosa, still with the wind power Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of the punta eugenia, moving 12 miles north at an hour's speed.
The storm interacts with cold waters of the Pacific, so it calms down
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico there are landslides with the strength of the tropical storm after noon or on Mondays.
The flat rains in some parts of Mexico can be very strong, with serious floods.
“The total amount of rainfall in stronger 3-6 inches is expected to be in North West Sanora Bay California, with a precipitation of up to 10 inches,” Weather.com says.
Rosa then departed to the north as a tropical rainstorm through Mexico in the form of a tropical rains of Arizona's borders earlier in morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression that then passes to Arizona and reaches the late evening of South Uta Tuesday.
“The main threat expected from roses or its waste is a very severe rain in North West Sonana, Baia California and the U.S. Red Area,” the National Center for Chalk.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and rocks in the desert as well as landslides in the mountainous region.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Detained for Four Premeditated Murders
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murdering a 16-year-old teenager whose body had been injured by a knife and who was discovered at dawn.
The sufferer boy was found on the elevated terrace, in the Midsomer Northton area, approximately at 04:00, on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition is stable.
As the police said, two 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-olds were arrested at the Radsky area last night.
The police called and contacted everyone who might have any phone pastries about what happened and what happened during the past few events.
As Trump said, Kavanauf had met with the rapture and anger of the Democratic Party.
“The voice given to Kachinauf is a voice to condemn the democratic party’s gross and horrific tactics,” Trump said at the Congress of West Virginia in Wilking.
Trump said Kavanauf had suffered influence and anger from the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Before presenting a convention on Thursday, Kavanauf denied all evidence of Christina Blacks Ford. She claimed that she was sexually abused ten years ago while they were adults.
The Ford also gave a testimony when interrogating.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people saw beauty, quality, and aspire from Kawanauf.
- Each voice given to Kavnauf is a recognition of the voice of one of our greatest civilians of our time, a courtman who has exemplary records and achievements in civil service. - He told the supporters of West Virginia.
The President also indirectly spoke about the nomination of Kavanauf when he spoke about the situation of the Republican Party that they had during the interim elections.
“We have only five weeks away from the most important elections in our lives.
I seem to have not been able to vote, but actually, it turns out that I'm bringing it,\" he said.
“That’s why I fight in each place to the fullest extent for these remarkable candidates.”
Trump stated that the current mission of democrats is to restrain and resist its efforts.”
The first procedural vote will be held in the Senate Hall no later than Friday. The GOP assistant said in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquakes, tsunamis, and huge increasing waves in Indonesia
On Saturday, state agencies said that at least 384 people died in disaster, killing many huge waves, when at the same time a strong tsunami and earthquake caused damage to the island of Sulaves in Indonesia.
Thousands of people were gathered at the coast of Palu on a Friday day, when the waves of a height of 6 feet (18 feet) were hit by a strong blow to the shore, burned up the lives of many, and destroyed everything they had met before.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-manufacture earthquake
“When the tsunami first appeared yesterday, people were not soon fleeing and were still on the beach and became victims of this disaster,” said Sutopo Purvo Nuprhom, a spokeswoman of the Indonesian disaster organization, at a briefing held in Jakarta.
“In this case, only the tsunami had no place, it had to transport cars, wood logs, houses and everything that was accompanied by the road,” Nugroho said. “The tsunami would have been at the speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
He said he even climbed some trees to save himself, and this method was lucky.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 different centers of Palau.
Documentary shots published by the emergency agency reflecting a number of buildings, shops, and bridges that were killed by this accident were also shown a mosque surrounded by a large amount of water.
Later, events were developed near the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series had an area of 2.4 million.
BPPT said that energy allocated during the disaster was more than 200 times more than what happened during World War II, a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima.
As for the geographical location of the city, it is located along the coast, which may have helped to increase the damage caused by disaster.
The event was named as a “wide scale,” saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotel were sacrificed.
The bodies of victims were found in the ruins of broken buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured in an accident and 29 are still in search.
Nugrohome also said that sacrifice and loss could be greater than 300 kilometers from the northern area of Palu (190 miles) in the Dongala area, just where the epicenter of the earthquake was located.
Communication was completely restricted in the information transmission aspect - between Dongmala and other areas, said Nukorho.
There are 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross and added that their volunteers and employees are heading towards the scene of the accident.
“It is already a tragedy, but it may have been worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency came under a rather large criticism for providing untimely information about the disaster that struck the city of Palu, and the agencies said that the waves had been put to another city when the alarm letter was still new.
On a shared content in social network, it is possible to see a man trying to warn the population of the rooftop and get their voice on the coming waves.
In just a few minutes, a huge stream of water was decided to land on the beach and took along buildings and cars.
Information agencies were unable to take appropriate measures in time.
Earthquakes and tsunamis harmed the power source between cities, and in fact, it made it impossible for officials to exchange information
Soldiers started sending first aid planes from Jakarta and other cities, in an accident zone, but the victims still need food and other primary items.
The city airport will re-rouge only for emergency cases and return to the usual working regime only in October.
President Joko Vidodo is planning to visit the Palau Evacuation Center on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the tsunami is more than 800.
That's very bad.
Mr. Dosseba said that when World Vision employees were heading from Dongala to Palu, they had to see horrible scenes and places, before they reached special places for defence.
He said, “They saw a lot of houses that destroyed the disaster.”
That's very bad.
Although many local rescue organizations began their activities and carried out various rescue operations, several similar foreign organizations were banned from entering the Palau territories.
According to the Indonesian Regulations, co-funding, assistance or support can be entered into the country only if it is recognized as an international disaster zone and acquires similar status.
This has not happened yet.
“It’s still a low non-end accident,” said Alia Ayay, a spokesperson of Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“As soon as the government approves that this is a national accident,” we will be able to receive international assistance, but there is still no message about it. “
After a Friday earthquake and tsunami, the second night, lost friends and family members were still hoping for the opportunity to survive their loved ones again, and the dark traces left by the natural disaster would not remain forever in their lives.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the irrigation channel.
On Sundays, security guards saved a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Jandon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Paragliding Flight Team, trained two flying pilots lost in disaster who had to participate in the coming Asian games scheduled for the current month in Indonesia.
Hotel Roa Roa, another people who came to ruins, came to be his students.
“As a paragliding experience, I have my emotional boundaries,” he said.
Mr. Gendon stated how fast the events in Roa Roa's hotel were spread in paragliding society. He was desperate to send messages to them through WhatsApp, to the Palusa who attended the festival on the beach.
Nevertheless, only one gray sign appeared on his message, not two blues.
\"I think this means they didn't get the message,\" he said.

Kenya West: The new name for the rapper is Ye
Rapper Keny Vest replaces his name and is named Ye.
On Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: “I’m officially known as Kenya Vest.”
The 41-year-old West's paternal name for some time was Ye, and he used it for his eighth album, which was released in June.
In addition, on Saturday live it is expected to see Ken's different visuals, right here is the expected release of his new album Yandhi.
The show's organizer said he'd be replaced by Ariana Grande who refused to speak for an emotional background.
In addition to having a current professional name, which is a certain abbreviation for Ken, West said the word has its religious value.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the most frequently mentioned word in the Bible, and it bears the meaning of ‘you’ in the Bible,” Ken said in an interview this year when he discussed the name of his album with the leading Big Boy in the radio.
“I am thee, I am thee, it is we.
From Kenya, which means just you, this name has become Ye-D -- to reflect our good, bad, unhappiness and everything.
The album is largely reflective of who we are.
It's one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sin Combs is known for names such as Puff Daddy, P.Diddy or Daddy, but this year she announced that she prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former Western collaborativeist, Jay-Z, emphasized the need for larger letters and defections in his name.
Mexico's AMLO vowed not to use military force against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use military force against citizens, for the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students in the country.
Lopez Obrador promised people on Saturday at a meeting in Tlatelolco Plaza that they would never use their military force to repress Mexican people. “
On October 2, 1968, soldiers attacked peaceful citizens with 300 left-wing deaths.
Lopez Obrador has promised to open monthly subsidies and new public universities for young people.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to engage in the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
Kai-Fu Lee, inventor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has experience in working with companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said that if China becomes a more active artificial intelligence aspect, the United States should double the amount spent on research.
The given comment was published after various parts of the American government made a statement regarding artificial intelligence, and emphasized the fact that America has no formal strategy for forming these topics.
At this time China presented its plan in the last year: It plans to become the number one leading state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling funds for research will be a good start for America if we consider how many other countries are behind this aspect of the U.S. and we are waiting for other new achievements,” said Lim.
Doubling funds will further increase the chance that further new discovery will be in the U.S. with an artificial intelligence, Lee said this week when writing an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book-artificial intelligence superpowers: China, the Silk Road and the World's New Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China's largest artificial intelligence organisations.
In the 1980s, he worked on artificial intelligence systems that were dismantled by U.S. top-ranking players at Carnegie Mellon University, later he was executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee Sympathia expressed his interest in U.S. government's technological competitions, such as the robotics competition in defense systems, and was interested in when the next similar event would take place to further illustrate future prospects.
Lee said U.S. researchers often need quite a lot of work to be able to receive grants.
“No China takes away academic leaders; but the corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies rent successful figures from universities to work with them in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lim also said immigration reforms can also contribute to the development of artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should automatically be given to people with PhD degree in artificial intelligence,” he said.
China State Consulate presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Lee noted that the China Natural Sciences Foundation funds scientists working in educational institutions, like state agencies, and these funding can also be received by American citizens, but the quality of research is still lower across China.
Just recently, the Department of Defense in the United States established the United Center of Artificial Intelligence, the main goal of which is to unite people in the industrial and academic aspect. The White House announced its readiness to establish an artificial intelligence committee and to choose members of its committee.
The company DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment that they are going to do on a project called AI Next.
In addition to the NSF, DAPRA invests 100 million annually in artificial intelligence.
Nevertheless, the American legislative body, which required the creation of the Security Committee with regard to artificial intelligence, did not take any step in this month.
Macedonian citizens will participate in a referendum related to the country's name change
On Sunday, the Macedonians took part in a referendum where they expressed their desire to change the name of their country and become the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a similar step to the ten-year conflict between Macedonia and Greece, and which prevents Macedonia from entering the European Union and NATO.
Greece, occupied by the province of Macedonia, said Macedonia has filed a claim on behalf of its territory in Greece. As a result, Greece has concluded the process of entering Macedonia’s NATO and the European Union.
Representatives of these two countries agreed to change their name in July, but nationalist opponents say that such action would undermine the Slavic origin of the Macedonians and discourage the price.
President, George Ivanov said he was not going to participate in the referendum, thus he claims to be a boycott and favors those speakers who are trying to hinder the 50 percent threshold.
The ballot paper on referendum was written on the following question:“Do you want NATO and EU membership through agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said this is the price required to be paid to join the EU and NATO, for Macedonia is one of the countries formed as a result of the collapse of Yugoslav.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, to vote for the young people who will be able to live calmly under the EU curtain, for it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievsk in Skopé.
Despite the lack of a legal union, members of Parliament said they would wait for the election results and observe if the number of votes is crucial for the country.
The country's name from Parliament needs more than two-thirds of votes.
The election commission stated that no report was recorded for 1 hour in the evening.
However, at this time only 16 percent of the population had been announced, which is significantly lower compared to the 2016 elections, where 34 percent of the population had already been announced at this time, where 66 percent of the population finally reported their opinion on the ballot.
“I came here to give voice to my children, our place is in Europe,” said José Tanevski, 62, from the capital city of Skopje.
Macedon Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko, supported the change of name for Macedonia, explaining the path of the country to NATO and the European Union, Macedonia on 30 September, 2018.
At this time in Skopje, front of Parliament Vladimir Kapzekov, 54 years old, preparing a small scene, carrying chairs and placing them in front of tents, for those who were against the referendum.
We also want to join NATO and EU, but we want to bring together these organizations at the cost of all the chapters, not other people's assistance.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can favor Russia and China and become members of the European Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said integration in NATO will bring more benefits to Macedonia, a country in which the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that most people will make this choice because 80 percent of the country favors the union between NATO and the European Union,” Zaveh said when filling out its newsletter.
He said, “Yes, there will be a result that will confirm our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Research, 30-43 percent of the population will participate in a referendum that cannot meet the requirements.
According to a second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of the population are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of respondents are going to respond positively to the referendum.
To successfully complete the referendum, you need 50 percent plus one voice.
The failure in the referendum demonstrates one of the greatest shortcomings of the pro-Western government, for they came to power in May last year.

The Argentine attacker took the ball to the middle of the field.
It fell between the three players of the defense of the brigton than it was in the open space.
After that, the Agüero was surrounded by four green T-shirt players.
He pushed one of the guards before being ahead of others and found himself at the edge of the eleven-meter strip.
After that, he handed the ball to the sterling.
Sterlig used the first touch to get back the ball back to the Aguero, while Aguero was able to walk on Brigton's right foot for Mateu Ryan, taking the goal back to the right corner.
“The problems of the leg are worried,” the coach of the club, Pep Gvardiaola told journalists.

Grease wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
After the nationals came out of the flute, there was no idea to put the root into the new beginning.
But, always competitive sheer hopes that her team will be able to win against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, this too is only if Rockies are still involved in the flute, and have one-played advantage in the baseball West Confederate Championship compared to Los Angeles Dodgers.
At night on Friday, Rockies managed to win 5-2 in a tense game with nationals, but still want to withdraw their first division title.
“Even though we play for nothing, we will be at least able to put the maximum in the square and we will know that the atmosphere created by the viewer and with the help of the opponent team can create a top-level game that is played this year.
Why should we not expect to participate in such competition?
Nationals have not yet published a list of start-up teams for the week, but in this case Shezer will definitely take the Picher position.
It's going to be 34th start, because at Thursday's game, he went out of the field, and that's why he's going to take the picker position on the week's game.

Trump holds stocks in West Virginia.
President Almacer spoke about events in the highest court around Brett Kawanauf when he spoke about the situation of the Republican Party, which they had during their mid-election period.
“Everything we have done will be the result in November.
Just five weeks away from us, the most important thing in our lives.
This is one of the greatest, greatest events -- I don't seem to run, but I'm actually building, and that's why I'm trying to fight these great candidates all the time,\" he said.
Trump also added, \"You see the terrible, terrible democrat groups, and you're watching all this at once.
They try to regain power using all sorts of effort, and you see this gap and pollution.
They're not interested in who to harm, who to pass, the main thing is to gain power and control, that's what they want to do with power and control, and we're not going to give them up.
He said that the current mission of democrats is -retention and resistance.\"
“And you can see that the last four days,” he said, and responded to the democrats -how glitters, rudes and non-Sandon are they. “
In addition, he also addressed the Senate Court Committee, and addressed the Democrats Senator Diana Feynstein, who received a pretty noisy response from the attendees.
The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.”
Did the official documents have been leaked from you?
Ah, Ah, what?
No ah no, - it was the worst body-transmitted gesture - the worst thing I've ever seen.
Hard work is no longer like a church.
It's non-tolerant to those who talk about what they think
When my party's driving force activists gave my censorship, I was very surprised.
After all, I'm the last person on the Labour MP -- and all this is because of what I think.
My parliamentary counterpart Joan Ryan had the same answer, because he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the adventure movement criticized Jeremy for disagreements with Corbyn.
Jeremy’s predecessors also disagreed on topics such as responsible economic policy to the initial state agencies, Europe and similar issues.
The letter of the attendees attending the Eastern Nottingham meeting was given - the special meeting was inclusive and productive.
After being in a local MP for eight years, the Friday night meeting was the same for me.
Sadly, today's meetings do not carry a tone like that, but good and polite, politics has been forgotten if there is ever something like this.
It is quite clear that there is a non-tolerant attitude in the Labour Party towards different opinions, and each opinion is criticized only by whether they agree with the leaders of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague, he was expected of me to change my opinion on various issues, and I would be in charge of a position that I would never agree on in my life - the theme of the state defence was going to change my view on one side trade in the EU.
When I speak publicly, I want to have the meaning of all of this -- in social media, all this is quite big violence, on demand for the early election, on demand of the collapse of the political center and leaving my party.
And that's not just my experience.
On the contrary, I think even luckingly, because part of the comments that arise about me is political.
I'm concerned about the professionals and efforts of colleagues who have to listen to sexist or race call every day, but they're never confused.
In today’s politics, it is disappointing that violence of the same kind has become normal for us.
Jeremy Schwinn said last week that the Labour Party should establish a tolerance culture tradition.
And the reality is that we no longer look like a church anymore, and every unsustainable step or change in changing the party's interior makes it even narrower.
For the past two years, I received quite a lot of advice to keep my head up, not to raise my voice, and only in such cases would everything be fine.
But that's not what I've come to do in politics.
After being a student of the Labour Party 32 years ago, and this decision was caused by the politics of the Tetcher, which was hampered by the classroom system, I aimed to serve them in a aspect of civil service that needs them most -- as a local representative or as a minister of government.
I will never hide my policy, even during last election.
In Eastern Nottingham, it is impossible anyone to be confused about my political position and about the differences I saw with the current ruling party.
For those who are taking the lead in the Friday meeting, the only thing that has to say is that when your country comes to Brexit, which can damage real estate, business, and civil service, I cannot understand why you should be willing to spend time and energy on similar loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But one message I own is not for the members of the Nottingham movement, but for my colleagues, for labor and for others: I'm proud that I have the opportunity to serve you, and I promise that no threat or bad political intention will prevent me from doing anything that I believe will serve your best interests.

Eir 38 - 17 Melrous: The Undefeated Eir Tablo
The last two matches could have some impact on the final outcome, but no doubt Eir deserved the triumphal victory that this team had in tenant premiere with today's game.
They are currently the only undefeated Tablo undefeated among the ten teams.
Finally, using their good defenses and chances, the team was able to build the dominant position at home, which is why the coach was able to please Peter Marsh.
“In each game, we tested our abilities, and we are still undefeated, which is why we should be happy,” he said.
Robin Christy, from Malroz, said: “In honor, they used better chances than us.”
At the 14th minute, Grant Anderson’s attempt to advance the Eir team by Frazier Climo, but for the Scottish captain, the Kwives cards given to Hory Hugg gave him a wide legion, and allowed Melrous and Jason Begott to use his chances.
After that, Climo was able to increase Eir’s advantage through the penalt, exactly before the first half ended and made a score 17-5.
Melrous started the second half quite well, and that's why with Patrick Anderson's attempt and the Baggot finish, they were able to decrease their advantage by five points.
All of this led to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who had to leave the square, but Eir was still able to cut far, and with the MacDoale's merit, Climo was reincarnation.
Amir's active captain Blair McFerson earned a yellow card again, as a result of which Melrous was unsuccessfully trying to reinvent players.
The players at home were able to enter the game, and when Struran Hachison received a yellow card to kill Climos, MacFerson was able to put the touchdown and pull Eir Maules in front of the game.
Clime was able to give and rein to the ball, and he was able to do it every time, after Kyle Roam David Armstrong's box was sent to Gregor Hanri at home at the fifth time of the players.
TV series, a solid game star is preparing for a restaurant career.

The actress refused to comment, but Scottish source reports that Kirnar is going to involve the Glasgous restaurant trade industry.
'Seas is ours': terrestrial locked Bolivia hopes the court will release the road to the Pacific
Seafarers patrolling the Ringing Cloud Division in La Paz
In public institutions, the dark blue flag flies.
The naval bases from Tykitaka to Amazone are the following motorcycles: The sea is ours.
His return is our duty.”
Bolivia's interlocking is because of the 19th casing conflict that ended with Chile's bloodshed - that's the sadness of this conflict is still evident in the Pacific.
Five years after the hearing, Bolivia looks forward to making an international court decision on October 1.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of unity and clarity, and of course expects positive response,” said Roberto Calzadiam, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivian people are going to live on the international trial, and of course most of them believe that after decades Chile will end up negotiating with the country and give up on the sea.
Evo Morales, the Charismatic President of Bolivia -- who expects next year's elections -- also has his point of view on Monday's procedural march.
“We are very close to the return of the Pacific,” said last August.
But part of analysts think that the chances of making a decision in favor of Bolivia are too low, and if that chance is true, there's nothing to do with it.
One of the United Nations’ centres based in Holland has no influence on the territory of Chile, saying their interference will not have any effect on this negotiation.
The International Court stated that the judgment comes out in six months after the final hearing, which means that the case was not tangled,” Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And it may have been the last four years that they've seen it.
“The case of returning to the sea was adopted by the Bolivian administration,” Zazarat said.
Bolivia's war mood may even remove Chile's last drop of well-being, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point in time, but their continuation will be extremely difficult after all.
The ambassadors of these two countries were not sent to each other in 1962.
The former president of Bolivia and the representative of the country in Haag, Eduardo Rodriguez Wells, rejected the opinion that the court's process was unusually fast.
Monday will give Bolivia a chance to open up new relations with Chile, and will give a chance to resolve 139-year disagreements with the satisfaction of both parties,” he said.
Calzadila also denied that Morales, one of Latino’s most popular presidents, used this conflict as a political handicap.
“Boliday never gives up the opportunity to get out of the Pacific,” he added.
“The return of the entrance is a chance to prove that we’ve come out of the past.”
North Korea has said the atomic disarmament process will not start until they trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Rie Yong Hoe said they would never disarm nuclear weapons until they trust Washington.
Rim talked about the United Nations Assembly on Saturday
He called on the United States to follow the promises that during the summit in Singapore, he promised to be between the two rival countries.
Of course, the United States also commented on her feedback. The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is on the verge of negotiations starting in Singapore three months ago with Kim Yong Unn.
Rie says that sanctions issued by America and a declaration of the end of the war with Korea is a empty dream to escape North Korea.
Washington plans to agree with a declaration rather than Phoenician takes the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want to do the second summit.
On the other hand, the skeptical idea that Fchenian is seriously thinking of denying his weapon, for that is what he thinks about the only path to peace.
Pompeo plans to visit Pewianian next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Trumpi.
Paris Fashion Show has revealed the latest massive puzzle collection that may cover your streets
If you want to increase the size of your head, or to protect your body from the sun completely, don't go far.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have revealed a set of huge and strange hats for their SS19 collection that brought Parisian style to surprise the current fashion week.
Very uncomfortable hats have covered the whole instagram world during the summer and designers spread the trend from afar.
The display version was made by Valentino, and the details included in it were similar to the massive boombul, fully hidden by models.
The other huge accessories were cut between watermelon, witch hat and pineapple - but their main goal is not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also published his strange collection of masks -- exactly when Halloween comes to the door.
Most of them are fully covered by the lips and represent a peeling lecturer rather than a representative of the fashionable world.
One of the creations was like a muvinta body, with its skinny glasses and lattices when the other had a form of ice cream.
And if you keep going on a huge fashion trend -- you've been lucky.
Stylist experts suggest that huge coins may even cover the streets near you.
In the huge hat collection, the \"La Bomber\" paired with high-grossing shoes, these hats have a two-foot upper limit, and they can be seen by people like Riana and Emily Ratayakovsky.
The cult creature in the form of huge hats, which had become completely social media, laid the foundation for a new creature on the podium -- a long beach bag that is as big as the model itself, which he wears.
The dark orange ruffy bag, saturated with raffia head and comes with a white leather handle, is one of the parts of the La Riviera SS19 collection from Paris Fashion Week.
A well-known facial stylist, Liuk Armitaj, with FEMAIL, said: 'I' expect big hats and beach bags to include streets for the next summer - because the designer had an impact on the demand, it would be very difficult to ignore.
John Edwards: Owning foreign languages is an important skill for the citizens of the world
The Association of Independent Schools of Scotland monitors the results of academic success, and continue this process in 2018, paying attention to good academic performances, which will grow even stronger lately in sports, art, music and other public fields.
There are 30,000 students from schools drawn up, the Independent Schools Consulate in Scotland, and they are always invited to provide top-level services to their parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and being a world citizen.
As an educational sector that can make the appropriate curriculum in schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and demanded subject in the future, which will be chosen in schools.
And Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in the language he understands, the words will directly affect his mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, the message goes directly to her heart. “
This reminds us once again that we can't rely only on English, while we try to build relationships and trust with representatives of different countries.
Among the independent schools, the results of the last years’ exams are unambiguous that foreign languages stand out with the highest scores and rankings.
68 percent of foreign learners received the highest grade A.
According to data collected from 74 schools in SCIS, 72 percent of students were scored in Chinese, while 72 percent of German teachers, 69 percent of French teachers and 63 percent of Spanish students also received a higher grade.
This shows the fact that independent schools in Scotland support the development of foreign languages as the most important skill necessary for the future of children.
The language is now paying so much attention to objects in independent schools and other places, such as STEM, science, technology, engineering, mathematics.
In a survey on employment in the UK in 2014, it was revealed that 17 percent of applicants refrain from applying for the language barrier.
And more and more attention is paid to foreign languages to prepare young people for the career of the future.
In a global world, the number of jobs in different languages increases, and the demand for these skills increases.
Despite career choices, if someone learns a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future to have an ever-increasing skill.
Communicating with a person of another nationality in his native language, people always progress in the employment aspect.
According to a survey by YouGov, between 4,000 British adults, in 2013, 75 percent could not communicate in any other language, and 15 percent could only speak French.
And now that language is important for our children, that's why we invest in this.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of the countries that have a growing economy, equips children with skills that are important for their employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different according to the classes of foreign languages.
Part of the school will focus on popular classical languages when the second part will focus on languages that will be important to the United Kingdom by 2020, and these languages are Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, you will always find a language that will interest him and be able to learn from experienced employees and specialists.
The Association of Independent Schools of Scotland strives to create the desired learning environment for children and wants to equip them with all the necessary skills that they need for the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a huge role in the economic development of the country, and all of this must be reflected in education.
Moreover, foreign languages should be considered as a skill necessary for international communication.
Independent schools will continue offering students choice, diversity and highest quality.
This should be done.

Lebron's debut in Lakes is made up of San Diego
Fans look forward to when they start with their first start in Lebron Jamesy in Los Angeles Lakes.
Laker's coach, Luke Walton, announced that Lebron will play in a weeks up against Denver Naget in San Diego.
But how many minutes you'll play, it's still unknown.
“The gaming time will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the official website of Lakes.
Leukers' journalist Mike Trudell said he would play James for a limited time on Twitter.
Last week, James was asked about his plans to play pre-sustaining games this week.
“In order to prepare, I don’t need any preconstructive games at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia speech, the YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launches an election campaign series today in Wiling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first one for five next week, and then on its destination list there are places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
A letter requested to fill out the High Court with confirmation Trump is going to create support for the intermediate election, for there is a risk of losing control at the Congress in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia meeting and how to watch it online?
Trump's Wiling West Virginia meeting is marked for 7 hours. Today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech lively via the YouTube channel link below.
At a very likely meeting, Trump will present a nomination of the High Court of Justice to Bret Kavnauf, who was involved in a conflict with sexual violence in the last few days, which is investigated by the Federal Investigation Bureau.
But with these meetings, the main goal of the Republicans is to gain some confidence for the November Elections.
Accordingly, Trump’s campaign office announced that the next five meetings were aimed at strengthening the volunteer work and support, as Republicans are trying to protect majoritarians and further strengthen them in the Senate and the House of Representatives, said Reuters.
“The establishment of control over the convention is of utmost importance because the President is planning to enter the state as much as possible during the ongoing campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesperson who denied him calling him Royals.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, this meeting, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wiling, may be a source of support from Ohio and Pennsylvania, all of which will be reflected by the Pitzburg media.
Last month, Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday second time, in which he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help the West Virginia Republican Party Senate candidate Patrick Morris, whose results vary in surveys.
“For the Morse is not a good sign when the precedent goes to attract his supporters,” said Simon Heder, political scientist from West Virginia University.
Raider’s Cup 2018: The United States team is hoping to prepare a week for an individual tournament
After the three-sided season, on Saturday evening, a four-sided race might be exactly what the Raider Cup needed for so long.
The shift of push and fate is a completely fictional model in sports, but athletes still hope that, especially in a race like the Raider Cup.
Nita, what do they say now, where is their momentum?
“We had a six-point advantage, and now four, that’s why we consider it as a little boy,” said Jordan Spit.
Of course, Europe enjoys the advantage, has four additional points and another twelve more points.
The Americans, as Spiet says, feel that you're worried about being too small about fear, because there's very much motivation in front of the game, and that's what Spiet's and Justin Thomas' game, who trained together and gained three out of four points.
Spit was known in the scope of the entire square, and for this example, he is the leader.
After the jubilee round, it became even louder, because Thomas and Spit had a score in two.
In 15 of them, the victory gained through their conquest was similar, noting that the Americans were not going to go out of the championship.
“The only thing that's going to happen to you is to concentrate and worry about your game,” Spiet said.
This is what each player has left for the moment.
18 left to drop.
The only players with more points than Spin and Thomas are Francesco Mollian and Tommy Fllywood, a rival story from the Raider Cup.
In Europe, Europe has a not-so- great advantage, but a wonderful couple put all the four out of the four and cannot be evaporated.
“Moliwood” is the only where they did not shoot Bogey on Saturday evening, they ran their head on the Saturdays of Bogey, Friday evenings and Fridays, even nine o'clock in the morning.
Depending on the given meeting, and the energy that both players have, it is obvious that the viewer is not laughing at the fact that none of the players will cover European victory and the sun will definitely be on Le Golf National or on Molinari.
It's possible for both, but for different deepens.
But it's still untimely to talk about European fame.
Buba Votson and Web Wimpson did a small job from Sergio Garcia, a four-point morning hero pairing with Alex Norren.
Bogie and two double points were gained by the Spanish and Schwedes and never had them so close to gaining advantage.
But on Sunday, there's no one who's able to use you to get out of your pit.
Four-sided and couple-sided games are very interesting watchmans, because watching couples' relationships, the advice they give to each other, and a strategy that might suddenly change.
Europe played a really better game as a team and gained a noticeable advantage for the last day, but the U.S. team also showed that they had a perspective to fight and are not going to be on the side, so everything is still questionable.
Europe is gaining 10-6 advantage for the final day of the Raider Cup
Europe will be a great advantage on the final day after they defeated the United States during the weekend and gained 10-6 victories.
The duo of Tommy Fllitwood and Francesco Molinar won at Tiiger Woods, who, with a difficulty, tried to move to the couple at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bönn from Europe suspects being able to return the cup he won two years ago, for Europe dominated America by playing the morning pair and winning a 3-1 victory.
The United States needs even more endurance, despite two victories, they cannot achieve the end of the goal.
Jim fari needs eight points from 12 weeks to win a Cup.
Flitwood is the first European guest to win the four-pointer, after he and Molynar have won sensational victory at Moliwood and have drawn closer to the sensational victory of the Raider Cup.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reid, their main goal is to defeat American newcomer, with a 5-point score of 5&4 points.
Although Woods showed an extraordinary game on Saturday he had 19 losses out of 29 games, where he was defeated seven times.
Justin Rose rested for four-pointer in the morning, representing Henryk Stanson's partner, with 2&1 defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka in the world.
In the South West of Paris, Europe didn't really have simple games.
The three-way winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point limit for Americans after the Saturday game.
They won 2&1 victory during a pact with John Ram and Jan Poulter, and then returned to defeat Paul and Rory McClar with a score 4&3, where the couple lost the first two holes.
During the entire history, only two times the team has done a kebab from the four-point repository. In addition, it is worth noting that the fiuri team only needs to equalize the points in order to win.
Two days after the best time in a row, more than a week after the counter attack is expected.
North Korea declares no-of-the-counter -- they're not going to disarme unilaterally without gaining confidence
During a conversation with the United Nations, North Korean Foreign Minister said sanctions would cause even greater distrust towards America and would not want to disarm nuclear weapons in a similar situation.
Rich Hom told the world’s General Assembly that China’s steps were, for the past few years, and stopped the testing of atomic and military weapons, made it clear even more well, that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology would not spread even more.
“But we do not see the appropriate answer and action from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be confident in our state security and because of such conditions we do not intend to disarm our country first.
When Rey made a statement about how they have to resist America’s current phase, his statement seemed sharply reflected the act that he did not fully reject unilateral disarmament, an act that was carried out two years ago.
Ri also mentioned Kim Yong Uni and Donald Trump's agreements and disadvantages at the 12 June summit, where Kim Trump promised to disarme the Korean Peninsula, when Trump promised him North Korea's security.
North Korea is reaching the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that the Pewian nuclear weapons should be put first.
Washington also refrained from talking about the removal of sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“Americans require first disarmament from the Korean side, and as sanctions, increase pressure to achieve a given goal, and also rely on a declaration on the end of war,” Riem said.
“The idea that sanctions can hit us is just a dream for those who have no idea about us.
But the problem is that the acting sanctions strengthen our distrust.
What did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader highlighted on the United Nations meeting this week.
Instead, the Minister emphasized the three meetings that took place during the last five months with Mung Taj-in of South Korea’s leader and added: “If the problem of armament was raised to South Korea instead of the US, the armament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so difficult.”
Nevertheless, the tone of the speech was very different in comparison with what it had last year at the United Nations Meeting. The General Assembly, which aimed at the United States and North Korea negotiations, became irreplaceable, after the bad president Trump called Kim-Racquet a man as a suicidal mission.
This year, at a meeting in the United States, Trump, promised the full destruction of Kim and North Korea last year, praised the leader of North Korea, but noted that there would be more to do and sanctions still act until Korea starts the disarmament process.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have time for it, if it would take two years, three or five months - no matter how important it is.
China and Russia say the United Nations security consulate should be awarded for a pkhaiani step ahead.
When the Secretary of the United Nations told the Consulate on Thursday that: “Safety Consulates must continue to carry out a uniformly given orders without any failure to finally confirm the disarmament.”
The Security Consulate in 2006 unanimously imposed North Korea sanctions to restrict and reduce funding for Fakhenyan in a aspect of the development of nuclear and firearm weapons.
Pompeo met with what was during the UN meeting and told him he would arrive in Pyongyang next month to plan for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last meeting was not so well.
He left Fchenian in July saying that only North Korea has achieved its unscrupulous need for progress.
North Korea promised to review the process of disarmament in the current month and to take necessary measures.
Rim claims that Kim had told him that the measures he wanted are security guarantees that Trump had promised him would normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on vacation sufficiently
Harvard University has given all students a special course that concentrates on teaching students enough rest, while the trend of ‘night temens’ and caffeine addictions is developing day after day.
The academics have found that students who are studying at the number one university don't even know how to manage themselves.
Charles Cissler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a brigamy and women's hospital specialist, created this course, which he believed is the first in the United States.
He decided to start a similar course after he learned how sleep disorders affect his study.
'After one meeting, a girl came to me and said, 'Why do they tell me this now at my final year'?'
He said nobody told him about the need to sleep before, which surprised me,\" he told the telegram.
The course took its origin this year, and its main goal is to explain to the students the impact of good sleep manners on academic and sports, as well as health conditions.
Paul Barrierera, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive of university health services, said that the university had decided to give a similar course after seeing how many children had fallen asleep during the week.
One-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
The picture of one of the sections shows various items, such as coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books, and tell about the effects of caffeine and sun rays, and how their results affect sports performance and what it does to have a routine sleeper.
At another section, the attendees ask how level of sleep disorders can develop a chance of infarction, cancer and depression.
The map placed on campus, with its marks, gives the bulls students a chance to think about their daily routine.
'We know this will not change the behavior of students' at once.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as they know the consequences of smoking cigarettes,' said Professor Syzler.
The culture of 'night bouts' still exists, she said, and added that modern technologies and increased pressure on students further contributes to an increase in the problem of sleep disorders.
A good, high-quality sleep should be the \"sacred secret weapon of students\" to fight stress, fatigue, and irritation -- to avoid excess weights, for our body is hungry and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, 19-year-old Californian, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Syzler to complete the course after Sou passed with him last year as a novice with one class of professors.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and gave him the motivation to create a far-reaching course.
The next step in its hope is to ask all graduates to pursue a similar course before they are again involved in a learning environment.
Professor Sysler advises students to set up a alarm clock before both sleep and wake up, and according to his opinion, students should avoid 'blue light' that reflects electrical screens and LED light, and can significantly change the rhythm of the heart, which leads to further sleep disruption.
Livington 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to beat Gerard's boys
Reingers experienced another failure after Doli Menga's goal was defeated by Stephen Gerard's team with a score of 1-0.
Ibrox's side expected to fix the first win, after 4-1 victory in Saint Johnstown last February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard and scored him a second failure in the 18 game on the position of the manager and left his team with eight points behind, compared to the top of the Premiership leaders.
Mengam shot seven minutes before the end of the first half, and broke the Reiner's line, which had not been so high before.
When the Knights fell to the sixth place, Levingston took the third place, and only one goal would be left behind by Hibernyan.
And in addition, the reinger may have an additional problem, since the player of their main composition, Kalum Spent, was injured in the head with an outside-fired object.
Gerard made eight changes during the game in the part of the team that defeated Batman Cup for the fourth time.
Holt, on the other hand, passed the same 11 points that he had scored last week, and he is grateful for how he reacts to the form of his players during each meeting.
It may have been a lot more than the Ranger had possession of the ball, but Livington did more with this ball than they had.
You've had to score two minutes before the Queen's rule, until the Menga was able to get the ball to Scott Pittman at the very first time, but the attack of Rangers, the opponent's midfielder, failed.
Kigan Jacobs' penalty kick reached a skiller until Craig, but the defense player, Alan Litgoum, was able to send the ball back.
The Knights were able to regain the ball again, but eventually they did not hope but looked more like faith.
Alfredo Morellos believed that he would give him a chance to hit the penalt after he hit Stephen Loules, but the referee dismissed him by raising the flag.
The Knights barely managed to run two shots in the first half of the game, but for the goalkeeper of the opponent team, Liam Kelly found it not so difficult to compete with Lasana and Ovie Ejaria's shot balls.
At that time, the Livingston solvent hit the ground at the 34th minute, and no one would deny it.
The Knights were still unable to deal with Jacobs' deep defenses.
Scott Arfield had nothing to do with Dechlan Galiger given the ball to Robinson, who had subjugated the ball and handed it to Menga to finish the attack.
Gerard changed Ryan Kent on the break, and the change had some impact on the wing, but the block, which was made up of the defense player, failed.
But Livingston was able to keep the desired pace and destroy the opponent by using the long pastes of Litgous and Hakelt.
The Holt team could have had the advantage of the last time, but McGregor stood firmly on the square and did not give each of the maneuvers performed by Jacobs until Litgoum did not make a corner from far away.
The reinference, Glenn Midlton, also asked for a penalt at the end of the game, but the referee refused.
Almanac: Inventor of Lodging
And now the page of our week's morning at Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the counting process...day when future physicist Johann Wilhelm-Han was born in Germany.
Gethsir invented a method of counting and discovering radioactivity, the discovery that laid the groundwork for the rhyme.
Since then, he has become part of the population since then, as well as in the 1950s film Colorado Zourabichvi, where he has a dialogue between scientist Roy Rogers and Dail Evans:
Men:What the Universe Is
Rogers: It's a lot of rhyme, used to use radioactive minerals like Uranium.
When you do these headphones, you can understand the impact of mineral atoms, which is caused by radio activity.
Evans: \"Well, he's really blaming this second time,\"
He died in 1945, some days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches the discovery of cells that have been detonated into the immune system
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to discover and kill cells.
The discovery of the vaccine cells is part of the treatment
The method includes the separation of immune cells from the patient's body and their laboratory changes.
After the change, they can look for proteins that are characteristic of many types of cancer, and then reinject them.
There's a trial of vaccines that show satisfying results among cancer patients.
One of the women's ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months as a result of its use.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells, changing them in laboratory conditions to find a protein HER2 that is characteristic of many types of cancers.
A professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland, U.S.A., says: “The results show that Vaccines are hopeful.”
-HER2 causes such tumors as breasts, ovarians, lungs and intestines - it notes.
This kind of approach to immune cells is also used for the treatment of leukemia.
Kene West began protrampulous calls. He was in the program on Saturday Night Live with the hat: “Let us make America again glorious.”
It didn't all go well.
The speech of Kenny West led to discontent in the program. In her performance, she was a member of America President Donald Trump, saying that she was still running for the presidential election in 2020.
During the performance of the third song, “the city of the ghosts” touched him with a hat inscription: “Let America be again great, his emotional speech was directed against the Democrats and again proved his support for Trump.
“As many times as I speak with white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump when it’s a race?
The West said, \"If I were concerned about racism, I would go a long time ago from America.\"
The show -Saturday Night Live began with a skatech in which Hollywood star Matt Damon had to challenge Brett Kavano's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee. Kavano Christine Ford accused of sexual harassment.
Even though West's speech wasn't broadcast on television, it's uploading a comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unknown that he tried this post for the West.
West also feared that behind the stage, he had problems with hats.
“They’re breaking me out of the scene.
They said, \"Don't go up to the stage with that hat.\"
They're breaking me!
And then they said, \"I'm sunk,\" says Washington Examiner speaking about West.
West continues: \"I'm going to wear a superman, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to fall in love with you.”
His comments made at least two comments in discontent between the attending community and the transmission cast. One of the people talked to Variety: “The silence of the Armenian silence stood in the whole studio.”
West was invited to the program by the singer Area Grande, whose former lover, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West broke down many people with your song, and I love your performance, and she was wearing the Perieri bottle costume.
West supported by the head of Conservative NGO TPUSA, Kendi Turner, who wrote on Twitter:“One of the bravest people: thanks for standing against the crowd.”
The talk show's presenter Karen Hunter said on Twitter that the West was just who he is and that's wonderful.
“But I can’t reward anyone (by buying music or by promoting music) who distributes the ideology that harms my society.
It's free.

“The King’s Game of Thrones, Star Keith Harington, speaks of “toxic masculinity”
Keith Harington is known for his role as John Snow on the HBO fantasy series The Game of Thrones, in the HBO's Royal Door.
A 31-year-old actress speaks of a hero on a Macho stereotype. In his opinion, by seeing similar roles on the screens, boys believe that if they are clumsy, they will gain respect from others.
When speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt points out that something is wrong -- and he wonders how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #seventh era.
Kitt, who recently married, was the 31-year-old star of Kingdom Games on Rose Lesley, admits that he feels strongly in front of the problem.
“Now I feel confident - what did we do about masculinity?” he says.
“What did we teach boys when they grew up? It’s because we see these problems now.”
Kitt believes that increasing this problem has contributed to the presence of masculinic heroes on television.
He continues: “What is natural, and what are the things being learned?
What do I teach in Street and on television force boys to stand on the side that is called male?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is how can we change it?
Because of course, something is not right for young men.
In an interview, he admitted that he will have no contact with the King’s Game, the Prequel and the Sepwell, when the final series will be released the next summer.
From November Kitt will be participating in Sam Shepard's renewed film Real West, which is a story about the film producer and his thief brother.
The actress recently announced that the best thing was to meet her husband, Rose.
“I met my wife at this show,” she says. “The show actually gave me the opportunity to build up my family.
Rose plays the role of Yigret, a character of Kitty, in which John Snow will fall in love with the Emmy Award-winning series.
The couple married Leslie family land in Scotland in June 2018.
AIDS: China speaks about 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people carrying AIDS virus has increased by 14%.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, say health ministry representatives.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them were given through sex, which is different from past experiences.
Traditionally, the HIV virus was rapidly circulating in different parts of China with blood transfusions.
But the number of people suffering this way was almost zero, and the representatives of the Ministry of Health of China say at the conference held in the province of Yenya.
Nevertheless, the number of people with AIDS year after year increases to 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV virus through sex is a major problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality occurred in China in 1997, but discrimination of LGBT people continues there.
Studies show that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of those men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
The disease is transmitted during sex due to the misuse of the wrong ways of protecting oneself.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to AIDS treatment will be universal in order to overcome this problem.
Maxin Woters rejects the loss of data from the Republican Party’s members, calling it “misleading lies” and “proposal theories.”
Maxine Waters, a member of the American House of Representatives, rejects allegations of widespread charges on Saturday that his article issued personal information of three Republican Senators and posted it on Wikipedia pages.
He argued that the accusations were managed by far-right experts and sites.
“Votes, lies, and even more hateful lies,” says Votters in his statement published on Twitter.
The reported personal information included addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham and Yuta Senators, Mike Lisa and Orin Hechi's home.
Information appeared on Thursdays by an unknown person online. At this time, the Senate held a panel hearing on allegations of the charges associated with the sexual harassment of Uzenas judge candidate Brett Kavano.
The information was leaked after three Senators asked Kawano questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, say the post was uploaded from the IP address associated with the Votter office.
“This is an unfounded charge, it is false and absolute truss,” Vosters continues.
-My Staf member is in no way responsible for the leak of this information. We have achieved a compromise on their identity, personal information and security.
“This is an unfounded charge, it is a false and absolute lie.”
The Votters’ assertion quickly led to critical assessments, including from former White House press directories.
“He’s angry rejects it,” Flasher writes.
-This fact tells us that Walters doesn't have the temperature needed for Congress membership.
When someone accuses you of something he didn't do, a person doesn't get angry.
A man is not stubborn.
A person does not ask questions about the motives of the accused.
But she keeps calm and anxious.”
A player apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of democrats to Judge Kavano, who was charged with criticizing the fact that Thursday's hearing seemed very angry.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who was running to take the position of a mid-term election for Yigri Waters, also voiced his views on Twitter.
“Great if that’s right,” he said on Twitter.
In his statement, Wheater said his office warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about this fraud:
“We ensure that the offenders were revealed - he continued, and that they are legally responsible for all their actions which are devastating and dangerous for any of my employees and all members of my employees.
A Review of John England's New Impact - Weaker Parody by Roseen Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for a Brexiti meaning in any new film with British trends, and it seems to refer to this new version of John England's action as a comedy genre in Parody, which began in 2003 with Johnny England and was re-launched in 2011, with Johnny England's reincarnation.
The ironic self-satisfaction should become a new opportunity to export our nation on the topic of what obvious garbage we are?
In any case, eye-cutting, a rubber-faced incompetent John England license has been upgraded for the second time to spoil everything - the name gives us more than anything else that it is a broad comic creature designed not for English cinema-like areas.
Of course, he is a silly secret agent, who, despite his odd claims against light glamor, has slightly clouso features, Mr. flat barns and adult suffocated qualities of the jelly that contribute one note to the motive of the fire wheelchair in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also originally based on a traveler and an international secret man who played Atkinson once in the television commercials of Barclaycard, who sowed chaos on his way.
There are one or two good moments in this last part of John England.
I liked John in England, dressed in a medieval armor closes to the helicopter and the rotor's blades intermittently reken his helmet.
The talent of Atkinson's physical comedian, but humor seems slightly weakened and strange, especially when the \"serious\" - the film brands such as 007 and the uncomplicated mission are offered self-confidently as an ingredient.
It feels like humor is designed for children, not for adults, and for me John England's silly disasters are not as creative and focused as the jokes of Atkinson's mute movies in Mr. Bin.
Now, the constant current message is that the UK is on a serious problem.
Cyber Hacker has penetrated into a super secret web network of UK spyers, revealing the identity of all UK field agents prior to the concerns of duty agents, unfortunately a small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister who is a pompeous and warrior figure that has been experiencing a full range of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does the maximum for this quasi-terreza-mei character, but there is nothing in the scenario to work.
His advisors in intelligence tell him that because each spy is compromised, he has to return someone from retirement.
This means that Johnny is taking England as a fool, he's currently working as a teacher at an excellent facility, but unofficially teaching how to become a secret spy: There's a couple of good jokes here when he offers a spying rock-type academy in England.
In England, they moved back to a special briefing in Whitehol and re-united his former multi-tasked bapps, which was again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, married to the head of a submarine boat, playing the role of a funny hockey cover, where Vicky Pepperdin is slightly lost.
So, being in the secret service of his nobleness, the brutally wrong way of doing the case, Betman and Robin come together again in action, suddenly met Olga Curlenko's beautiful fateful woman, Ophelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is becoming a dangerous magician of charismatic technological billionaires that claims to be able to solve British computer trials: a criminal named Jason Volta, who plays Jeck Les.
In England and Buff start their Odyssea with a steep high one: disguised as waiters, they fire at a expensive French restaurant; they form chaos and steal on a luxurious yacht of Volta; and in England causes a pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality device to get to know the interior of the Volta House.
Every stop, of course, is pulled into this last sequence, but such a benevolent and energetic as it is, quite a bit of child television is for this.
It's pretty medium.
And just like John England, I couldn't think I couldn't think of the British film industry to give Rowen Atkinson a role that would really be fair for his talent?
Labour Party denies the plan for Britons to work on four days a week and get five days of refund
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a refund of five.
According to reports, the party must give company leaders the savings received by the AI Revolution, giving them an additional holiday day.
That's what employees will be able to enjoy with a three-day job -- but they'll get the same pay back at home.
The sources report that the idea-referred to the economic agenda and plans of the party in order to make the country rejoice in the favor of the employees.
The transition to a four-day week by already endorsed trade unions as a way for employees to benefit from a changeable economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party official, Sandi Times, told: ‘The announcement of a review of politics is expected to be made by the end of this year’.
‘It won’t happen suddenly, but a four-day job week is an aspiration that corresponds to a party’s approach, and a balancing economy in favor of employees as well as a party’s common industrial strategy.’
The Labour Party is not the first to get this idea, the Greens Party promised us a four-day job week during the 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not fully endorsed by the Labour Party but is not fully endorsed.
Labour Party representative said: ‘A four-day working week is not a party’s policy and it is not reviewed by the party.’
The Northern Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous week of the Labour Party conference to clear his vision on the socialist economy in the economy.
Mr MacDonald said he was ready to take control of his power for \"poor directors\" and \"speculants\" in communal companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also imply that current thirtieths of water supply companies may not fully regain their interests, as the Labour government may act as a “expression” based on the perceived crime.
He also confirmed the plan to appoint employees to the company council and create inclusive property funds to transfer the capital of private sector companies to employees, which is equivalent to annual dividends in the amount of £500.
Lindsey Grammy, John F. Kennedy, would say -60 minutes - Will the Federal Bureau be replaced by their opinion about Kavano
The Federal Bureau’s investigation on the charges against Judge Bret Kavano has been late for at least a week and the final vote on its appointment in the Supreme Court and raises the question whether the bureau’s received reports will force Republican Senators to force them to support.
In a week’s Ether interview, about 60 minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said I would go to the hearing room, and I said, ‘I talked to the judge.’
I called after the charge that was announced, I said, 'You're a sniff?'
He was steadfast, imperceptibly, unambiguous.”
However, the sound of Grammy seems unbelief.
“My mind is fully exposed to Brett Kavanot, and it will be a charge like that of Dinomit,” he said.
-Doct. Ford, I know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied this firmly,\" he added, referring to what Christine Black Ford was.
“And if anyone calls it, they won’t confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the World Citizen Festival and did it do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host a world citizen festival, an annual music event that has an extremely impressive composition of the performer stars and an equally impressive mission that needs to end world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gathered on the Grand Mind of Central Park, who will not only enjoy the output of Janet Jackson, Cardi bis, and Sean Mendes, but will raise awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is adding a world poverty project, an international pro-apartment group, which hope to end poverty, to increase the number of people fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket of the event (except if you would like to purchase VIP ticket), the concert speakers must perform a number of tasks, or activities as volunteering for the world leader, make a phone call, or in any other important way to raise awareness of the purpose of the event, which is the end of poverty.
But just how successful is the World Citizen Festival 12 years before it's achieved its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert with people a true way to convince people to ask for action, or is there just another case of so-called climaticism -- when people think they make a real difference by signing an online petition or posting it on Twitter?
Since 2011, the world citizen informs us that it has been recorded on 19 million activity - more from its supporters, pulling the hosts of various goals.
It reported that these activities helped global leaders to declare commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that would have to affect the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group citation of 390 commitments and statements due to its activities, from which at least 10 billion dollars have already been distributed or collected.
The group's estimates that the security funds have been directly influenced by more than 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments are the power of food, the partnership of investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, committed to helping children increase their full potential, - they promise to transfer Rwanda to $35 million to help end food shortages in the country after they received over 4,700 tweets from world citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can lead a history of social injustices of food failure,” said Food Force Ambassador Tracy Ulman at a live concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities were carried out, urged what the United Kingdom would do to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the project, the food power that will reach 5 million women and children, providing food.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on our website, which we ask: Why do you think we can end up in extreme poverty?
The world citizen responded: \"This will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and lose.
But just like the great civil rights and the anti-Apartheid movements we're going to succeed, because we're getting stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardboard B, Genel Monnet are among some of the events in New York this year, led by Deborah Francis Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval forces for blockage - to hinder Russia's energy export - Minister of Internal Affairs
In case of necessity - Washington can address its marine forces to prevent Russian energy, knocking the market, including the Middle East, said U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Singer as quoted by Washington Eskisemaner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria was, in particular, where the legitimate government’s invitation to the government is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to trade with energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, on the south of Europe,” he said.
And, according to official data, there are ways and means to handle it.
“The United States of America has the ability to ensure that the marines are open and, if necessary, make a blockade to ensure that their energy does not go through the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Union, a non-profit group that will present itself as the “Energy Customer Voice” in the USA.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, saying that they were actually the same thing.
“Economic option against Russia and Iran is more or less of a fuel leverage and change,” he said, referring to Russia as one of Russia’s specialties - its economy depends on the fuel.
The reports come that the Trump administration has set its goal to increase its liquid gas export to Europe and change Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, the representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany that no-deal Nord Strim 2 pipeline project, which said Trump, Berlin was Moscow-Budget.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the 2 pipelines with 11 billion Nord Strip are designed to double the volume of the existing pipeline, up to 110 billion cubic meters, a clean economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition towards the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the idea that energy can not be a means of pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after meeting with U.S. Minister of Energy in Moscow, Rick Perrier in September.
The U.S. position has led to discontent from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
In the German leading organization in the industry, the German Federation of Industry (BUDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policies and mutual agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply,” said the chairman of the German Industry Federation (BDI), Dieter Kempf, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren-seriously looks at the election as she participates in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would view it as a serious part of the presidential election following the interim election.
At Holoika City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider participating.
“It’s time, in Washington, D.C., women go to repair our broken government, and this includes the presence of a woman in the head,” she said, according to Hill.
The 6th of November, I seriously look at the Battle for the President.
Warren led President Donald Trump while in City Hall, saying that this country was leading him in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” he said.
While criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano, Warren was sincere.
We need to investigate the federal bureau before voting on Friday.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not believe that he should run in 2020.
According to the Safolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globbi survey, forty-eight per cent of voters in Massachusetts, the Senator said he should not run the vote.
Thirty-two percent support this candidacy.
The poll provided more support to former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent supported potential candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other, more famous names in democrats will be considered to be included in the 2020 vote by Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bern Sanders.
Biden said it officially in January will decide, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Peylin Quotation Track on Peylin’s Post-traumatic Stress Disorder by Donald Trump
Track Peylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence incident on Monday night
“What my own child passes through when he returns, I also connect with other families who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders and some wounds that our soldiers have returned to,” he told the audience about Donald Trump’s action in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called his arrest “a obvious problem” and said his son and other veterans of war, “they return slightly to the back, they turn back to the heart, and they get back and wonder whether they are receiving the respect of their friend soldiers and pilots and other military personnel.”
He was arrested on Monday in Uasila, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, a representative of the Uassala Police Department, with Dan Bennett's words on domestic violence and wearing weapons while being in a sober state.
18 State, Colombian District supporting new asylum law
Eighteen states and the Colombian district support a legal challenge to a new US policy that does not provide shelter for the victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 State and Columbia District in Washington, D.C. brought a resume to the court-friend to support asylum seekers, cause politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Claimant in dealing with Grace Cessman, who filed the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not identified.
He said his partner, and his children, a violent gang member, had abused him, but U.S. officials refused to ask him for shelter on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State trustees supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala producing a large number of applicants for US asylum as these nations stand in the face of severe problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The US New Asylum Policy abolished the 2014 decision of the Appeal Council of immigrants, which allowed the law-enforcement immigrants to treat domestic violence and take refuge.
Governor General of the Columbia District, Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy would regulate the decades of state, federal and international law.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum requests rely on specific facts and demand circumstances, and these restrictions violate this principle,” the court-friendly said.
Trustees next to Ikama’s resume that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering, condemns US policies, says they become more entrepreneurs and provide us with the necessary workforce.”
The trustee General Jeff Seshns ordered the immigration judges in June to no longer provide refuge for the victims of domestic and gang violence.
“Safar is available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of being a member of a particular social group or a particular social group,” said Sedsens on June 11, during a policy declaration.
The shelter has never been to alleviate all of the problems -- even if all of the serious problems -- people are facing all of the world every day.
A self-sacrificing attempt of rescuers in Palu, where the number of survivors in the search race increases twice
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“A lot of tension,” said 35-year-old Rasa Kusuma, before she comforted her baby in the center of the evacuation in the city of Palu.

Clean water is insufficient. “

US Ambassador to China accuses China by ‘propagandist ads’ in Violence’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-page advertisement where the U.S. every day demands the overall U.S.-China trade benefits, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the American press.
US President Donald Trump addressed Chaiana on last Wednesday a paid supplement to Des Moines Registrer - to the most selling newspaper in Iowa State - after Chinese blaming, in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. 6 November Congress elections, China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections, which made it clear what the US representatives told Reuters has become a new phase of campaign escalation by Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal to place advertising by foreign governments to promote trade, there are currently in the escalation of Beijing and the U.S. War of Commerce where they increase tariffs on items imported from each other.
China’s response tariffs were created at the beginning of the trade war to hit exporters to the United States, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Bransted, former U.S. Ambassador to China and Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, says Beijing has suffered from American employees, farmers and businessmen.
Brandted wrote in the Monday issue of Des Moines Register that China now doubles this violence by spreading propaganda in our free press.
In the propagand spread, the Chinese government enjoys a tender tradition of free speech in America and a free press, by placing a paid advertisement at Des Moines Register, - writes Bransted.
“In contrast with here in the newspaper booth along the street in Beijing, you will see a limited difference and you will not see a reflection of a real different thought that could have Chinese people on the trajectory of China’s problematic economy, showing that media is under the heavy ceremony of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He added that one of the best-known newspapers in China refused to publish her article, although he did not say that the newspaper did.
With Kavano’s failure, Republicans alienate with women in front of voters, warn analysts
As long as the high-ranking Republicans are in anticipation mode and defends the highest court candidate Brett Kavano before several prosecutions of sexual assaults, analysts warned that during the mid-elections they will receive a negative outcome, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this were extremely high, and most Republicans have already registered, Io and feel that they want to move forward to vote.
He told Grant Rieher, professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, on Saturday.
Richer said he suspects that Senator Jeff Fluck (Rizona) would have been a last minute push to investigate the federal bureau, it would be enough to get angry towards calming voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser to the progressive group MoveOn and national spokesperson on Friday, according to a Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration at the Senate Hall, protesters sang on November - when Republicans who control the Judaea committee decided to ahead of Kavano’s appointment, despite the fact that Dr. Christine Blaze Ford’s display was reported by Mic.
(In their comments, readers should avoid expressing religious, racial and national discrimination, not use offensive and derogatory expressions, as well as appeals that are contrary to the law)
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But he may be higher, especially in the suburbs and younger voters between the rocking voters of women, between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, often do not participate in the elections.”
Even before a public display of Ford's accusations against a high court candidate, analysts suggest that this will lead to negative consequences if the Republicans are going forward with evidence.
“This has become a silly mess for Republicans,” said Michael Stylian, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, the NBC News reported.
-The case is not only in the committee vote, or in the final vote, or whether they will be able to vote or not on the Kawano seat, the case is also about how Republicans came to this and how they treated it, - Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that promotes the selection of Democrats, pointed out on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat confused about who to believe in Ford and how to drive, and a little bit more supports the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford testimony, when 35 claims that they definitely or perhaps believe in a Kavanos.
Additionally, 38 percent claim that Kawano is likely or definitely lied when giving when only 30 percent claim the same forefront.
After being pressured from flutes, the Federal Bureau is currently investigated by Ford, as well as the accusations committed by other protesters, Deborah Ramires, reported by Gardiani.
The Ford showed the previous week under the oath before the Senate’s Legal Committee that Kavano incarcerated him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a high court candidate showed him the genitals when they were at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
A global network inventor plans to create a new internet to deter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global network inventor, will launch a new project that will counter Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-L Open Platform Solid.
Soid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people are allowed to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Liem told us that Inrupt’s intention is the world’s domination.
“We now have to do this,” he said about the beginning.
“It’s a historical moment,” he says.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to access their own online data storage site or POD.
This may include contact lists, cases list, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s just like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be available in one browser and at once.
What has unique personal online data storage is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it a person’s authority through data.”
According to John Bruce’s director, Inrupt’s idea is to bring together resources, processes and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lis, Bruce, IBM-sell security platform, several employees from the developers with whom the contract was signed to work on the project, and from the union of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications with tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they will submit a full change, where all their business models will be fully upside down in one day.
“We do not ask them for permission.”
In an article published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt-Mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the network created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a global network consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debates of network neutrality.
Even in the beginning of Inrupt, Berners will be the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this era of the network,” added Berners-Lim.
Bernard Vani: Receiving the Victoria Cross in 1 World War by a Clergy
The only clergyman of the Church of England in the First World War, as a warrior to Victoria Cross, was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel-Leitenant priest Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Belanggliz and Levk.
However, he killed a sniper four days later and never understood that he had received the British highest military dignity.
On Saturday, at the Parad, his two grandchildren raised a memorable stone in Rashiden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, noted that it was, as a marvel, symbolic, that the stone was raised at the age of 100 from the win of his grandfather's award.
According to the London newspaper, on 29 September 1918, Colonel-Leitenant Van led his battalion along the San Kentin Channel -regardless of very thick fog and artillery under heavy fire of bullets and bullets.
And then he went towards the fireline, and, above all, he took the line ahead of the artillery, and he turned out three of them.
Colonel Van was killed by German Snipper on October 4, 1918 - exactly one month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather’s actions were something I couldn’t do, but what is humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, were also crowned after the parade, led by the British Imperial Youth band.
Michael Van said he feels deeply appreciated because he participates in the paradox, adding that the courage of the true hero is seen in support of many people. “
Mixed martial art fans spent a night watching Bellator for 206 instead of Gochi Pepa
Imagine you had the whole time to get you to the Bellator for 206, and you couldn't do the main event.
San Jose account included 13 battles, including six major cards, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on 5 channels.
After Gerard Moussa and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers of the United Kingdom remained amazed when the broadcasting program turned to Gochi on Pepa.
Some of them were upset after they spent the night especially at this night.
One fan described a tweeter switch on children's muffler as \"something a sick joke.\"
“This is a state regulation that at 6 a.m. this program was inappropriate, so they had to switch to the children’s program,” said David Schwartz, Vice President of Bellator Marketing and Communications, when asked about the program.
“My daughter Pepa,” he says. “I’m sorry.
Scott Cocker, President of Bellator, said they're working on their schedule to look forward to seeing the audiences of the United Kingdom in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think maybe we should think something,” Cocker said.
“But there are six hours in the morning, Sundays, and we can't work on it until our time is Sunday, and their time is Mondays.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when I changed, there’s a lot of text walked forward and none of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was government.
I promise you, subsequently, it won't happen again.
We're going to have five battles instead of six -- like we're doing normally -- we've tried to show fans more and we just got superfluous.
It's a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale’s sexual orientation is due to his self-injured state - felt
Olympic guvinist Tom Dale says that he grew up with the feeling of being oppressed compared to others because of his sexual orientation -- but that gave him motivation to become successful.
At the age of 24, she says she didn’t know until she went to high school, where she wasn’t all like me. “
For the first time, speaking about 4 radios Desert Island Discs, which leads Lorraine Lavern, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others the opportunity to read. “
He also said that after she became a parent, she was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsti Young, a regular host of the show, missed for several months because of his illness.
In the first Lavern program, Dale stated that when she grew up, she felt less than others, because she wasn’t social when both boys and girls liked you.”
He said, \"For now, those feelings that I felt less and less differently than others were real, which gave me strength to succeed.\"
He wanted to prove that he was -- something, he said, so he would not disappoint everyone when they finally understood about his sexual orientation.
The bronze medalist of the Orgsi Olympics became known as the LGBTT campaign and used his appearance in the Commonwealth Games of Australia this year to protest discrimination of homosexuality in the presence of more countries.
He said he voted because he was lucky to live openly without things and wanted to be given to others.
The three-time champion of the world announced that a man would fall in love with - the United States film maker Dustin Lens Black, who met me in 2013 - \"I was really in love with him.\"
Dale married Oscars, who is 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you were so many of your age, he was 14 years old at his first Olympics, and his father died three years later of cancer -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age, who was like a laugh and a laughter.
The couple became the parents of their son in June named after Robert Ray Blek-Day, and Dale says that her total values have changed.
“If you had been reading this year, the only thing I wanted was to win the gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal at the Robiyas. “
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011, after having discovered brain cancer.
Dale said that his father did not accept the fact that he had to die and that one of the last he asked was if he had tickets for London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to her, ‘You couldn’t be in the first row, Father’,” she said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it did not happen until he really stopped breathing and did not die, I finally could not realize that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Dale competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that this is what I dreamed of all my life -- dive in before my fans at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that,” he said.
This was also inspired by choosing his own first song - Proud by Heather Small, which led to resonance while taking part in the Olympics and still being in a stance.
Desert Island Discs will be on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:45.
Based on the statement of the President of Georgia, Ms. Michelson
The American Phil Millerson set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match on the Reider Cup, but he had to regain a form that would not turn him into a phase of disaster.
Michelson, who participates in a record for the two-year period, said Captain Jim Primez in a statement on Saturday and Forsam.
Instead of being at the center of action, as he was often in the United States, the five-time winner set his day between being a crutch and working on his game, hoping that he will correct what he suffers.
Never, the most correct driver, even at the peak of his career, is not ideal for his 48-year-old ideally fit for Le Golf Nasional's course, long and rude, constantly punishing the wrong blow.
And if the course itself is not hard enough, Michelson, at the ninth match on Sunday, is confronting the exact British Open Championships Francesco Molynar, who competes with the novice Tom Fluciud to win all four matches this week.
If Americans start 12 single matches below four points, a hot start-up match will be absolutely important.
Primate expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
“He fully realized the role he had played today,” he said. “I had a arm on my shoulders, and I had a arm, and he told me that tomorrow he would be ready,” he said.
She's very self-confident.
It's in the Hall of Glory, and it's made a lot of sense to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably couldn't understand that he was going to play two matches.
I've had a lot more understanding, but that's how it worked, and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, as well as everyone else.”
On Sunday, Michelson completes the record of most of the matches over Nick Faldo, Rider's cup.
This may indicate the end of the Reider Cup career that has never corresponded to the heights of its individual records.
Michelion has 18 profits, 20 failures and seven half-life, although the Primate stated that his presence brought some unreliable sensations.
“It’s funny, it’s sarcastic, it’s stingy, likes to joke about people, and it’s a good type you should have in your team,” he explained.
“I think young players have had fun with him, just like this week, which was a good sight.
It offers a lot more than just a game.”
Europe’s captain, Thomas Björn, knows that big difference could soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of Europe, knows that being ahead of a big difference in the last day’s singles can easily become an uncomfortable race.
Daen made her debut in 1997 on Walderama, where the side he owned, Steve Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage with Americans, but the finish line was close to the least difference, winning what was 141-161.
“You remind yourself that we had a big difference over Walderama; we had a big difference in Brooklyn, where we were defeated, and we won for Valderama, but only,” Björn said, after 5-3 winning ears of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday when they had the advantage of 10-6 Le Golf in the Nasional.
So history shows me both, and everyone in the team, that it's not over.
You'll play full-time tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything you need.
This is not done until points are written on your dashboard.
We have a goal, and this is to try to win the cup, and our focus remains on it.
All this time I was saying, I'm orientational to 12 players who are on our side, but we know well what stands on the other side of the world - the largest players of the world.
Satisfied by how his players played in a tense golf match, Björn added: “I couldn’t imagine it.
Tomorrow another beast will be waiting for us.
We're waiting for individual speeches tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's a cool feeling when you stand there with your partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you check it fully as a golf player.
This is the message you need to bring to players, show your maximum tomorrow.
Now, you have your partner backwards and he needs to get out and also reveal his maximum.
Unlike Björney, Jim Primck on the opposite side expects his players to play individually better than in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas who scored three points from four.
Primsky himself was at the end of the big fashions of the previous day, a part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it was defeated by Europe, and the wonders of the media were revealed.
“I remember every sad word from there,” he said, “and asked him how he applied the captain, Ben Crenoum, to his players in 1999 when he was leading the last day.”
(Laughter) We have 12 important matches, but you want to get the quick start you see in Brooklyn, just like what you saw in Medina.
When this momentum is taking one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the match.
We have established our composition and put our boys out there as fashion, as we feel, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas committed himself to resisting and meeting Rory McElroy in a major match, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ramm, Tommy Felwood and Ian Pulter in the upper half of the sequence of other Europeans.
“I got into this sequence with this group of boys because I think it's all going through,” Björn said while selecting his single.
The German new warship was delayed once again
The German fleet's new frigate had to be adopted in 2014, to replace aging Cold War combat ships, but it cannot be obtained until at least next year due to the cost of defective systems and growing systems, local media reported.
The new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class Frigates was postponed until the first half of 2019, as a newspaper Die Zeit quotes the words of the military representative.
The ship's fleet had to join in 2014, but the further issues of providing the ship's fleet have made it difficult to complete this ambitious project.
Four pieces of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class aircraft, which was ordered by the fleet in 2007, must be substituted by the Bremen class frigates.
It's understandable that they'll have a strong submarine, a squeezing, and a number of anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features include long storage periods - it should be possible to place new frigates from home port for two years away.
However, constant delays mean that cutting-edge combatships -- which are designed to strengthen Germany's naval force -- they're already out-of-date when they're engaged in work, pointing out Die Zeit.
The Avodeth F125 Frigate came across the title last year when the German fleet officially rejected the receipt of the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard factory in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned the ship to the builder after the ship was delivered.
The reason for the return is little known, but German media noted a number of important programmable and hardware defects, which made the battleship useless if its launch would take place.
The software was especially important because the vessel of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class manages the crew of 120 sailors - only half the personal composition of the old-fashioned Bremen class.
Also, it turns out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its productivity and limits its fleet's ability to add improvements to the future.
The 7,000-ton (Rheinland-Pfalz) would be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Together with the problematic equipment, the price makes it difficult for the full project - to involve crew training - one more issue.
As they say, tremendously it reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from €2.2 billion.
The accompanying problems of the latest frigates are of particular importance in light of the latest warning that the strength of the German fleet decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee, admitted that the fleet actually escapes from the occupancy of capable ships.
The representative claims that the problem will be backwards over time, because the old warships were removed from consumption, but the substitute ships were not left behind.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's class frigates would join the fleet.
National trust is watching the secret life of the bats
A new study carried out in the mountainous areas of Scotland aims to find out how bats use landscapes to hunt on food.
They hope that discoveries will shed light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help us to carry out future protection activities.
The Scottish National Trust Science Survey will keep track of both ordinary and small bats as well as the brown ears of bats and the dabbonton bats in the Inverves Gardens, West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed on the main locations along the property to control the night activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers also carry out moving observations using hand detectors.
The analysis of all the recordings of the sound by experts will determine the frequency of the bats calling, and which species will do that.
Then consists of a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the Scottish National Trust Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how they will use each species.
This information will enable you to determine the advantages of habitat management, such as how to create meadows for forested bats and other species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has been significantly reduced during the last century.
They threaten construction and development works that affect their nesting and dispose of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning are also at risk, as well as some chemical means of adhesive paper and building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not actually blind.
However, because of their night hunt habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a victim.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to determine the location and obstacles of insects on their flight.
The Scottish National Trust, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious to the bats.
Matt has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, conduct inspections and sometimes rescue works.
The organization also organized a protected area for the first and only bats in Scotland, in Daffi and Galloway, a home for the ten bats of Scotland.
The land manager David Tompson says the land is an ideal area for them.
\"Here, in Triph, we have a large area for the bats,\" he said.
-We have old buildings, lots of old trees with many good habitats.
But there are many things we still don’t know about the bats, so the work we produce here and other lands will help us understand more about what they need to love.’
It emphasizes the importance of checking the bats before carrying out protection works, since inadvertent destruction of one maternity nest can kill up to 400 females and young ones, which is likely to lead to the full destruction of local populations.
The bats are protected, and they kill, burn, or bother, or destroy their bushes is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish officer for the night's defense trust, makes a public agile to help protect them.
He said: “We need to know a lot more about our bats and our species. We just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldu is freed from the accusations of rape and lawyers complain about the German magazine
Krishtijano calls Ronaldum the accusations of rape against him - false news, - claims that people should be “invented” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker are accused of rape by an American woman named Catherine Majorga at Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
It is also accused of paying $375,000 in order to prevent the incident from taking a vote, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours later, when the accusations were published, Ronaldum, 33-year-old, called allegations, false news.
No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,\" says a gold ball five-time winner in front of the camera.
“They want to advertise their advertising using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and everything's in line,\" added a player with a smile.
Ronaldus’ lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the reason that they have been given an unacceptable report based on suspicions in the area of personal life, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz says that the player requires compensation-moral damages, in the amount of severity of violation that may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
It is said that an incident occurred in June 2009, at Palm Hotel and at Las Vegas Casino.
After meeting at nightclub, Ronaldu and Meiorga returned to the player's room based on information, where they charged him analy, according to filled sheets in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mejorga states that after the incident, Ronald fell down on his knees and said he was 99 percent -- a good boy -- one percent, a betrayed boy.
According to documents, Ronaldo admits that the couple had sex, but that was mutually agreed.
Mejorga also stated that she came to the police and showed him pictures of her traumas, but then agreed to settle without a dispute, because she felt the fear of being angry, and was afraid to become publicly humiliated. “
He's 34 years old, claiming he's now trying to tie a dispute because he's still traumatized from the incident.
Ronaldus was from Manchester United on the move to Real Madrid when the accused was attacked, and this summer he was transferred to the Italian giant with a agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexitis: The United Kingdom’s health is losing automobile manufacturers.
The United Kingdom is a world leader in automobile production due to the loss of the status of the world's leader, announcing business secretary Greg Clark after Brexit.
He added that at the heart of the fact that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would lead to a temporary delay in the production of the factory located in Burnaton near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer has said that the impact of border delays, if the deal fails, will be affected by Brexit's jobs.
The Burnaston factory (which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensiss, released approximately 150,000 cars in the previous year, and their 90% had been exported to other EU countries.
-In my opinion, if Britain comes out in the EU and at the end of March, we will see the termination of production in our factory - said the managing director of Toyota's in Burnston.
Other UK automobile manufacturers fear leaving the European Union without agreements on transbound trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims it will close its minicarkhana in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issue that concerns the views of automobile manufacturers is the risk of creating a supply chain in case of non-compliance with Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line is based on a so-called “time” where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes for cars already ordered from both the European Union and the United Kingdom suppliers.
In the event that the United Kingdom will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March, this may lead to violations on the border that will cause delays and parts to be deficient in the industry.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to keep an inventory for more than a day at its derbishier factory, according to the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s Checherz’s plan on future relations with the EU is specifically designed to prevent such checks on the border.”
“We need to get this deal. We want to get the best deal that will enable us, as I said, to achieve success at this point, and to get that opportunity in the future,” said BBC’s Radio 4’s Today Program’s ether.
Based on evidence obtained from other manufacturers besides Toyota, we definitely need to continue to carry out highly successful measures of supply networks.
Toyota failed to comment on the period of termination of production, but warned us that if this continue for a long time, the above will lead to a decrease in factory competitiveness and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvaris, who has worked on the Burnaston facility for 24 years and is the head of the professional union in the factory, states that his members are very worried about this fact.
The spokesperson of the government said:“We have presented an accurate and rational plan for our future relations with the EU.”

According to a White House statement made on Sunday, high-ranking meetings of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein-can be postponed for the next week - since the battle with the candidate nominated by the Supreme Court is still continuing
Rosenstein observes (controllings) the work of a special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the issue of interference in Russian elections, links between Trump's support and Russia, and the President's potential misconduct.
Whether Trump will confront his Deputy Minister of Justice and whether he will create a threat to his independence, this gossip will exaggerate Washington for months.
Earlier this month, during an interview with New York Time, Rosenstein stated that he had discussed the use of hearing aids to talk with Trump, and the possibility to retake the president based on the 25th revision.
Rosenstein refused this account (on the report).
On the previous Monday he arrived at the White House, and based on the score planning to resign.
Therefore, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was appointed on Wednesday
Trump said he did not want to argue with Rosenstein, but he later postponed the meeting with the Senate Legal Committee to avoid conflict, which at the time listened to the testimony of Kavanafi and one of the women of Christin Bleissey Ford of her sexual crimes.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation of a complaint against Kannapi by FBI, and then postponed the vote at the Senate plenary session.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders was on Fox News.
Regarding meeting with Rosenstein, he said:The exact date has not yet been established, a note may be appointed this week, in my opinion the delay of the meeting is related to the current issues in the Supreme Court.
But we're going to see, and we're going to tell the media news.
Several reports are going to appeal to the claims: Sanders did not carry a briefing in the White House after 10 September.
The host was interested in the reason.
As stated by Sanders Brewings failure is not related to the failure of teleportors to act, but he also added:“I agree that this action is designed to achieve a special effect.”
Later, he said that the immediate connection between Trump and the media will increase.
“The President holds more Q&A sessions than his predecessor presidents have added, and without citation the evidence added:“We looked at their affiliation.”
According to Sanders, briefings will take place in the future, but if the press has a chance to directly ask the President of the United States, it is much better to speak to me than to speak to me.
We're trying to do a lot, and as you can see in the last few weeks, a great deal of work has been done, and we're also planning to conduct briefings where you'll be able to talk directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly listens to queries when leaving the White House, or participates in open sessions and high-ranking press conferences.
Special press conferences are held rarely.
This week, in New York City, President expected to demonstrate why ideas are free to generate and show the original image before the assembled Reporters.
Minister of Health wrote to EU employee on the fears of Brexit in NHS Showantia
The Minister of Health wrote to the Scottish NHS staff working in the European Union and expressed gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire to keep their jobs after Brexit.
MSP wrote a letter to Jean Freeman at least six months before leaving the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed a commitment to cover the claims required for those EU citizens working in the transmitted public services.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman writes: “All the summers are being negotiated between the EU and the United Kingdom with a very likely decision to be made in the fall.
Nevertheless, the United Kingdom government is also preparing for the unattainable deal scenario.
I understand that this can happen to you during a hindrance.
So I'd like to remind you once again how I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the European Union and other regions share a very valuable experience and knowledge that enhances and improves health care, and is beneficial for patients from our country and society.
Scotland, in fact, is your homeland, and we are very willing to stay here.
Christion Aber cram will undergo surgical surgery after injury
-He is a midfielder of the state of Tennessee, Christon Abercrom surgery with the Wanderbult Co-operations after receiving the injury in the 31-27 season, - says the Tennessee Mike Organis.
The chief coach of the State of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the player had received a trauma before half play.
“He approached the page line and immediately it happened,” Reed tried.
The trainers and medical staff gave Aber Crumb oxygen to the ground before it was moved on the stretcher and was taken for further research.
The official person of the State of Tennessee told WSMV’s Chris Harris in Nashvili, Tennessee that Aberkrum is preparing for surgical surgery at the Vanderbulti Medical Center.
Harry added that he doesn't have any more information about his trauma at this point -- and the State of Tennessee is trying to identify a place of injury.
Aberkrumb, a red-measured athlete, plays in his first season in Tennessee after moving to Illinois.
On Saturday he collected an attempt to take five balls, and in total 18 of those attempts were collected in this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom with extra cash used for vulnerable layers in accordance with new plans for tori
Movement will neutralize Corbyn’s success on the way to attract young voters
There will be an increase in the cost of the Serious Fees for persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury suggests its increase to 120 million pounds per year for homeless citizens
Theresa May’s today’s statement that foreign buyers will be obliged to pay a higher fee during the purchase of property in the United Kingdom with additional cash used to help homeless citizens.
The movement will be considered as a attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with mortgages with a more accessible housing and to provide citizens with high income.
The Serbo fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom with additional funds that help the government to fight the problems of homeless citizens.
The sub-cracker, which is added to the current geography assembly, including high levels, which were introduced two years ago to the second residence and purchased for rent, is defined by a percentage of three percent.
Treasury suggests an increase in up to 120 million pounds per year.
A 13 percent of London’s new real estate is buying non-residents, thus increasing prices and making it harder for those who want to buy first housing in this sector.
Many rich districts of the country, especially in the capital, have been transformed into so-called cities, since most of them are purchased by foreigners who are not in the country.
At this stage, a new policy is being developed after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the germ fees to enable young people to purchase their first housing.
It harms large developer companies to keep up with high standards of price, and they're unsullied, and calls on Ms. May's to cancel quotas for affordable housing.
Mr. Corbyn made a statement about significant reforms in the real estate sector, control of their Sri than renting and completion of unjustifiable evictions.
It also has the intent to give cons (advisors) more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: \"In the last year, I've tried to give up all my premieres in the British Dream execution, and life will be even better for the next generations.
And that means we will respond to the failure of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
Nevertheless, it won't be right if we facilitate real estate acquisition procedures for individuals who don't live in the United Kingdom or foreign companies, unlike those working in the UK.
For many people, buying their own house remains an untimely dream, and the degraded night-fall remains a reality under the open air.
Jack Ross - My Maximum Ambition to Scotland
Jack Ross says his greatest ambition to become the head of Scotland at any stage.
Scott, 42, takes pleasure in the North East Club's restoration, which currently occupies the third place in the first league, and has lost three points to the highest point.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light under the leadership of St. Mirén in the final season of Scottish premiere.
“I wanted to go out on behalf of my country as a player.
I got the B margin, what I wanted to do was -- Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland Sportsand.
From childhood, I watched my father with me in Scotland's Hampden, and all this turns back to me as a child.
We will use this opportunity only in the club management if my success is successful.”
Ross' predecessors were Dick's lawyer, David Moyes, Three Allardances, Martin Oneyle, Roy Ken, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic states that he did not feel discomfort while working with such famous faces in the big club, and he had previously refused initiatives from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Sorry, no records were found. Please adjust your search criteria and try again.
If we look at this corner as a structure and infrastructure, surely, its place is in the Premier League -- he says.
“This is not an easy task, but with great probability I consider myself a successful manager, my club will happen in the Premier League.”
Ross began his career in management three years ago, initially taking the position of co-worker in Dubarton, and then spent 15 months in Hearts' Coaching Group.
He then moved to the third group of Alloa and reached St Mirren's title in the next season.
And Ross says he feels better than before when he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He remembers it as a real crossroad.
-I, really, believe that management is the right move, much correct than the game.
It's strange, but I feel good, I get rational revenues, and I get some heights.
But the game is hard.
You're going to have to overcome lots of challenges for the week.
I'm dealing with this stress and pressure that is characteristic of my work, but I still think I'm not in management.
I have always been attracted to management and am currently busy. I feel comfortable with it.”

According to the study Saturday, 17.30pm. Is a wonderful time for a pint
The hot summer breeze increased the income of British pubs, but fueled restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July but the income was reduced by 4.8 percent in restaurants, according to the calculations held.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, who conducted this calculation, states: “Storage warm weather and participation in unexpected World Cups for England would have contributed to the existence of the same indicators in July, as in the previous month, when club income increased by 28 percent, while restaurants saw greater losses.
In June, the restaurant’s lowered rate of sales by 1.8 percent has worsened in July.
Drinks a trader in pubs and bars have strengthened their positions in proportion to restaurant indicators.
Food trader Pubs suffered because of heat, but not so seriously compared to restaurant operators.
At first glance, citizens just wanted to drink.
Whereas sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% for a month, sales of food products decreased by three percent -
RSM Tourism Analyst Paul Newman said: These results continue the trend set by us at the end of April.
Weather and main social or sport events impact are important factors in relation to sales on the domestic market.
Without a doubt, restaurant groups will continue to fight because their sales are reduced by 4.8 percent per year, which is especially painful against the background of accrual of current taxes.
The long hot summer is not a good time for food vendor operators and time shows whether moderate temperatures expected in August are on the ground.
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new open facilities, has reached 2.7 percent in July, and the growth of the brand is slow in production.
Coffer Peach Tracker is monitoring sales in the United Kingdom’s pubs, bars and restaurants, where information from 47 operating groups has been collected and analyzed, with total turnover exceeding 9 billion pounds of serling and is set as an industrial orientation.

News with increased fears that sexual content is being published
Sixty percent of surveyed students said they had a ‘basic page’ to show their parents
Every fifth of all children, some of them are under the age of 11 creating a social network report that hides their parents.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 students of secondary education institutions, an increase in “instagram-fake profiles” was reported on the website of sharing an instagram photo.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students report using a clean-basic report to show their parents, and they also have their personal reports.
One parent took her 13-year-old daughter on a secret site, offering her to be raped to others.”
According to a study conducted by the UK Digital Technology Awareness Workshop and Directors of Independent Schools, 40 percent of students use two profiles from 11 to 18 years old, and half of them have received permission to use personal profiles.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary when a lot of teenagers open up online space that isn’t known for their parents and teachers.”

Advertising of a breast pump, where mother is compared to a cow, shares the opinion online
The Brethren company shared its opinion on the Internet through advertising that compares nursing mothers with the scouring cows
To celebrate the new beginning, it is said that the world's first silent breast pump was released by consumer technology company Elvie in the style of the advertising video music video used to show freedom, which gives the new pump to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers who dance in the grass-filled cows barn, a song that includes the following words:\"Yes, I'm eating milk myself, but you don't see a tail - and -if you don't notice it, it's not a jucchini, it's my breasts.
The team continues: “The visit, come out, I eat it with children, come out and come out, I feed my ladies.”
However, advertising, published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed reaction from the viewers, and many said it shed light on the risk of milk industry-defense.
“It was very bad to use cows in advertising this product.
We need to get pregnant and get rid of milk, except that they take their children after several days of birth -- writes one.
Elvie’s breast pump is indistinguishable to fit in nursing lip (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment has been made: “Let’s say it’s traumatic to both mother and child.
But why shouldn't they use breast pump advertising for those who give birth to a child?
Someone added:“Understanding advertising.”
Others guarded advertising. One woman admits that she seemed to be singing as an act of humor.
“I think it's a genius idea.
I would have had one if I was nursing.
When you come up, you feel like a real cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I got it as it was.
It's a genius product -- writes one.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad, intended for mothers who eat milk (often in their workplace or in the toilets) and feel cows.”
It's not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, it's shown that women dance with hidden pumps in lip.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that most women who struggle to say they feel cows.
And the Elvie pump is completely silent, it doesn't have wires or pipes, and it goes invisibly into the lip, allowing women to move freely, hold children in their hands, and even go out even when they come.
Anna Balarin, partner and ECD mother comment: “Elvie’s pump is so revolutionary product that it deserves to be heard and provocative.
In the parallels between the self-expression of women's self-expression and wild cows, we wanted to get out of the mammal's milk and get all its problems in the spotlight, whereby showing the feeling of entertainment and interesting freedom, which will give a new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pump hit the news headlines
During London Fashion Week, two children's mother appeared on the podium designer Martha Yakubovsky during the product use.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of occupied migrants increased sharply, although the monthly border crossing remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration introduced strict rhetoric and policy, which made it difficult to place children with sponsors
Traditionally, most sponsors were self-explained immigrants who were afraid to threaten the possibility of being in their country while moving forward to demand a child.
The risk grew in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family would have to provide fingerprints and transfer their data to immigration bodies.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, high-ranking and customs enforcement officials, confirmed before the Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who requested sponsorship of homeless minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not previously committed a crime.
About 80 percent of those who are family members of sponsors or sponsors are illegal in the country and their significant part are criminal residents.
So we will continue to chase these people, said Mr. Albens.
In order to speed up the process of children, officials presented new rules, according to which some of them should appear before the court within a month, not after 60 days, which was provided by the previous standards in accordance with the shelter workers
Many will appear through a video conference, not personally in order to announce their legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are not subject to help are immediately deported.
According to the report of asylum workers and reports, which appeared from the system over the last months, the longer the children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will be being worried or depressed, which may lead to violent manifestations or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems have been strengthened in larger institutions such as Tornike, where signs that the child will face more difficulties, depending on his size.
They also added that without having enough time and means of peace of mind for children, the transfer of their tents to the city can make the trauma that most of them have already fought.
Syria commands U.S., France, and Turkey’s occupation forces to immediately lead their troops
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wald al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, even though the country's war continues for the eighth year
Mualem, also deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegal in the Syrian land, under the pretext of combating terrorism and was considered as a “abundance”
“They should get out immediately and without any conditions,” he told the congregation.
Mualem argued that the War of the Terrorism in Syria was almost overthrown, where more than 360,000 people were killed from 2011 and millions were expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue -to this holy battle until he releases the entire territory of Syria - from any illegal foreign existence of any terrorist groups. -
The United States has about 2,000 militarymen in Syria, which are mainly trained and taught both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in war-torn lands.
As for the refugees, Molem said their return conditions were good, and he accused some of the Western countries -- which spreads military fear -- which prompted refugees to unreturn to the country
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote their return,” he said.
“They have a policy that should only be a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not receive recovery aid until political agreement between Asad and opposition will end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement on the creation of a buffer zone between Russia and Turkey, in the last major illegitimate ill-treatment forces, creating an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement abolished Russia’s support, a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem emphasized that the agreement had a-clear deadline, and expressed hope that military actions would be directed against the Jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-related nosra against front fighters who would be eliminated.’
The UN representative Stefan de Mesturature hopes that soon the first session of the new committee will be brought together by the government and opposition to develop the post-war Constitution for Syria and explain the way for elections.
Mualem defined the terms of participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and said the work of the Commission should be limited to the discussion of the current Constitution’s articles - and warned against interference.
Why choose Trump for a second term
With this logic, Mr. Trump in 2020 will win re-elections if, as many liberal audiences hope, impeachment and scandal will not end its presidency prematurely.
What will it be like without any doubt - the most dramatic final of the presidentship -
There are no signs of fatigue in the audience at this point.
Since 2014, Prime Time has doubled ratings on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly three times increased at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen News, the average 2.4 million Primetime audiences on Fox News, which was 1.7 million more than four years ago, and the Ms.N.BC-Rachel Medeau show on the main news evening exceeded 3.5 million in the cable channels ranking.

Beyond money, it turned into a stringent mid-term election for the House of Revolution.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a stream of money thanks to the restructuring of the Congress election districts, which took two positions in battle for the same place.
This newly rebuilt suburban district surrounded by a member of the Democratic Chamber of Representatives, Connor Lemb, who won the second round in a special election last spring.
Lampby goes against another official, Republican, Kate Rothfus, who currently represents 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is partly matched by the new 17th
The maps were reorganized when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January proved that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of Republicans.
In the new 17th round led to the reduction of campaign funding of the campaign of the Financial Department of Parties, Democratic Congress (DCCC) and Republicans Committee (NRC) of Georgia.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in March, in the 18th district of Pennsylvania
This place was held in the republic for decades, and President Donald Trump defeated the district with 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight advantage to democrats.
The United States has failed to support China in El Salvador
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama admitted to Beijing by negligible pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama before partners released the Trump Organization's management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to return the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama - the last decision on Taiwan's rejection of recognition - said the spokesperson of the department Heser Navert at the beginning of this month.
But fines were provided only for El Salvador, which received USD 140 million with the help of the U.S. in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed fines, which include the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will be painful for Central American countries and its high level of unemployment and murder
The local meetings were developed, according to the development of North American and Central American officials to resign from a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being after the last year’s similar meetings as a step forward to prevent migration in the U.S.
But by the middle of September, high-ranking officials of the administration clearly noted that they wanted the conference to go ahead and actually stop reviewing the fines for El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Retir will now deliver a speech at a conference scheduled in mid-October as a sign that the administration will change its gathering places.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, the Republic of Panama and the Dominican Republic, without the release of new strict messages and punishments.
The White House spokesperson Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the conditions of anonymity on internal discussions.
Their reports were confirmed by a third-party analyst who is close to the administration and also talked about the conditions of anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be the speech of a special attorney Robert Muller about the possible observation of the justice of Mr. Trump, which is quite significant today in public reports.
Mr. Mueller also reported that his investigation was about whether Mr. Trump was a campaign against Russia during our election.
If the Congress is out of hand, then Mr. Trump himself is faced with accountability, just as he is preparing to talk to the voters, and ultimately he is faced with a jury of his colleagues.
It's a lot of it, and I don't mean the idea that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable -- just like its equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were willing to coup against Hitler, only to the West, resist the Ts, and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We've lost and missed out on the opportunity to prevent the bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around such inflation and the incessant march of democracy is speeding up or delaying
Americans are now facing these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump will release General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein from his position, a person who controls the fate of the investigation by Mr. Muller?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the newspaper reported that last year he decided to secretly sign up for the president and talk about his unsuitable position
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times is wrong.
-How to respond if recently requested an F.B.I. investigation on Brett Kaval is not complete or fair - or if it was confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite reliable accusations of sexual violence and unscrupulous evidence?
And first of all, is there any average vote for a Congress to bring Trump to justice?
If we take this test, democracy will continue with a long winter period.
But I believe we can, from a lesson that I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz once held a home for the Embassy.
He survived, he was immigration to America, and after 60 years he sent me to take the Saturday candles on this swastish table.

Reinger Graham Dorns is optimistic ahead of the Vienna Rapid match
The Knights hosted Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory with the Austrians after an impressive Frie with William in Spain earlier this month, making them a place to get out of the Erovnuli Liga G group.
Due to the article injury, the midfielder Graham Doran, in a 2-2 score with William, failed to make a debut in the season, but she believes that the reiner can use these results as a placeholder for better results in the future.
“We were good at the moment because the villa is good for us,” said a 31-year-old footballer.
“We entered the game because we thought we could get something and get one point.
Maybe we could do something at the end, but in the end, it was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we went out in the second half, and we beat them out.
Thursday, this is another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game, because they had good results in the last match, but, along with fans, I'm sure we can achieve success and achieve positive results.
Last year it was really hard, starting from my trauma to club changes, but now there's an optimistic factor.
The team is good and the boys play really well; the preparation is good.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season past and achieve success!

Saivov, 30 years old, is expected to use a Home Depot rented car on the lower Manhattan highway along the western roadway of biking, pedestrians, and bicycles to attack.
In order to demand a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saigon-Drug had killed 8 people and that they had seriously damaged people, according to a written request to achieve death in a district south of New York.
Both of them take into account possible death sentences, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal high jury has charged Saipov 22 charges involving 8 murder charges, attributed to banditism used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases to accuse violence and car destruction.

Warren plans to look closely into the process of fighting for presidential
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November election, he will carefully observe the process of fighting for presidentialism
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about his future on Saturday in the West Massachusetts Republic.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after the team requires his victory over Sebastian Fetel.
From the moment he became aware that Walter Botass was attending Louis Hamilton's Saturdays, and Mercedes's orders would play a great role in the competition.
Bottas started well and almost out of Hamilton after he defended his position in the first two matches and led Vettel to the attack of his teammates.
The Vettel first entered the Pittstop and left Hamilton to get into the trap of the traffic group, which must have been decisive.
Mercedes passed the circle late and went out of the back of Westtel, but Hamilton went ahead after a few wheels clashing on the wheel, leaving Ferrari’s driver reluctantly to leave the interior space free after a double move to protect the third corner.
Max Versaten started from the back row and was on the seventh place at his 21st birthday, at the end of the first round.
He then held a large portion of the race than he owned his salads so that he could quickly finish it and run it to Kim at the fourth place for the remake.
Eventually, he was released on the 44th round of Box, but he was unable to improve his pace in the remaining 8 rounds, and Reikonen took the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all week long, and she turned out to be a real gentleman, and she told me what about it.
The team worked exceptionally well to hold the first and second places, said Hamilton.
It was really bad gesture.
President Donald Trump at a meeting on Saturday was dismantled by Senator Diana Feynstein that he did not spread a letter from Christina Bleys Ford, in which the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano accused him of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, President did not directly address Ford before the Senate Committee, instead of Magi made a comment that developments in the Senate showed that people were a hateful, disgusting, and liar.
“The only thing that can happen and the wonderful thing that lasts in the last few days in the Senate when you see the rage when you see people who are angry and disgusting and disgusting and deceptive,” he said.
“When you see releases and information leaks, and when they say ‘Oh,’ I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it.\"
Do You Recall?
Diana Feynstein, Have you disseminated information?
Do you remember his answer... I didn't spread a letter -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not running away.
Then, wait a minute.
We spread... no, we didn't spread it,\" he added, with an impression from the Senator.
A letter to Feynstein was sent in detail to describe the accusations committed against Kavano in July, which was disclosed in early September - but Finstein denies that the leak came from his office.
“I have not hid the accusations of Dr. Ford, and I have not spread them. I have to Committee Feynstein, said Hill.
“He told me it was confidential, and I got it confidentially as he asked me to.”
But his rejection, it seems, did not like the president who responded during the Sabbath meeting, saying, \"I'll tell you that this was really a bad gesture.
It may not have spread out, but it was the worst gesture I have ever seen.”
By continuing to protect the Supreme Court, those who accused three women of sexual abuse, the President stated that Democrats use the charges for their purposes.
“They try to get back power by any means.
You see a hatred, a hatred, a person who is hurting, who goes beyond power and control -- reports MediaTimes.

We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were honest after understanding this story,” he added.
At the same time, the government fears that the number of dead will increase to thousands of people, as the Agency for Disaster mitigation states that the availability of Donggala, Shiga, and Buting cities is limited.
-It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, since many of the bodies are still under ruins, and for many we have not yet been able to reach - said Sutopo Purvo Ngroho's representative.

A micronesian crash: Air Newgin reports that after a plane crash in the lagoon, one person is lost.
The airline, which ran a flight in the Pacific Laguna, Micronesia, now reports that one person is missing without a doubt, since he finally stated that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from a sunken plane.
Air Newgin said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon, he was unable to calculate male-sex passengers correctly.
The airline says it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find those men
Airline has not provided detailed information about passengers, such as age or nationality
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the aircraft fell into the water while trying to fly at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline claims that six passengers were taken to the hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
It remains unclear that the exact sequence of events of calamity remains.
According to the airline and the United States Navy, the aircraft flew near the runway in Laguna.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was running on the path.
The American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying too low.
“That’s very good,” says Jane.
Janes said he and others were able to get out of an airplane full of water that continued to sink, from an evacuation exit.
He said the wheels were panicked, and they shouted, and that he got a little injury.
According to the United States Navy, seafarers also helped rescue the rescue process on the coast of inflatable boats until the plane sunk at a depth of 30 feet (100 feet).

Analyst releases the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the Prosecutor’s Office moved the case against a man accused of murdering a woman alive in the Mississippi state.
The United States Analyst of Justice, Paul Rowlet, has shown for a few hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to gather together a 29-year-old accused Queen of Telisi and a 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers’ movement on the night when he occurred murdering.
Roulette said she received location data from a cell phone, which showed that Tellis and Jessica were together in the death evening, which contradicts her previous statements, reports Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with me at age, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford gave testimony on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if he was telling Telisi the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck at night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville. “
Another inconsistency was that he said he knew Chambers for about two weeks during his death.
Cell phones indicate that they knew each other only for a week.
Roulette stated that after a while after the death of Chambers, the phone erased the messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
\"He erased him from his life,\" he said.
Defenders must start their final arguments on Sundays.
The judge said that this trial should be delivered to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
The New Yorker nanny over the couple’s sue-rasist text
The New Yorker nanny in court sued the couple for the discriminatory dismissal of her mother after receiving the wrong-addressed text from her mother, where she complained that she was another black man.
spouses deny that they are racers, who compare the lawsuit to force,
Lins Plasko-Floxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when it turned out to be a new provider of child care, Lizsel Morris, was black when she came on her first working day in 2016.
“It’s not another black man,” she wrote to her husband, Plasco Flexman.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, he twice sent him to Ms. Morris.
After guessing the error, “Mr. Plasco-Floxman, found in the back of his back, was released by Ms. Morris and said that his nanny, who was African-American, was poorly doing his job, and instead, he waited for the Philippines, reported the New York Post.
They paid her for her one-day job, and then she was put into Uber's house.
Now Morris complains for his release and requests compensation for $350 a day for a six-month period on which he was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to show them, look that something like this doesn’t do,” he told Post on Friday adding: “I know this discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations that they were racers by the fact that the release of Morris was reasonable because they feared that they could no longer trust him after they abused him.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
It's not a racer.
We're not a raceist, - said husband Joel Plasco in Post.
“But would you be able to hand over your children to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?”
Your newborn baby?
All right.
According to the statement, his wife was only two months old, and she was in a very difficult situation.
Do you promise to go to someone like that?
It’s not very pleasant to do the job,” added an investment banker.
Despite the fact that the trial continues, the Court of Public Opinion immediately condemned the couple in social networks where they were accused of conduct and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not be positive towards the sister, says the new letter.
“It’s hard to imagine yourself instead of someone else,” says Karen Janquel, who was born shortly after the book’s birth, “to think of yourself as your first time before it is published.
Now it's very fun to know that we know Paddington's huge success.\"
To say that his father, who worked as an BBC operator before he was inspired to write a book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic because his work was rejected and added that his 60th anniversary of the book was a sweet-skinned-skinned one year ago after his death.
Regarding Paddington, which he referred to as “a very important member of our family,” he added, “to keep his father silent with his possible success.”
He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn't a courtesy person -- he said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, almost as if you had a child who describes any success:you are proud of him, although in fact it is not your currently done thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success this way.
Although he was created and his imagination, he always respected Paddington himself.
My son was dying, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When flying, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors in vain tried to save her.
She said, \"It's really bad that she didn't want to do it,\" she says, Ednan-Laperus.
“Then Nadi called me to tell him that he would die in 2 minutes, and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, \"Yes, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines that doctors gave to his heart beating were slowly strangled and left to his body.
He died and everything broke out.
I just had to sit down and wait for me to realize that this would end.
I couldn't smell or shout or cry, because I was surrounded by family and close people.
All this had to be left in me.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperus, with his daughter's sorrows, sat down with other passengers on the plane, despite the severe trials she faced.
-No one knew, - he said.
“I had a squeezing head and tears came to my eyes.
It's hard to explain it, but at exactly the time of the flight, I felt it was a huge feeling of compassion towards the backdrop.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her,
Open cards for the miserable ladies to eliminate suicide from bridges.
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work to eliminate the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hampfrey placed a postage on the Wales Bridge with postage messages and phone numbers where people can call for help
The Tyler of Ms. Davis's son was 13 when she began depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with an transmitted smile.
“All knew him with a smile.
They always said that their smile would light up any room.
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, discovered his brother after his suicide
Ms. Davis says:
Ms. Davis created cards that people knew that there are people with whom you can come and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk about it.
Ms. Hampfr, who was a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or depressed or something similar,” he said.
A few days before the birth, we noticed the change in character.
On Christmas Day, when children remember their gifts, they didn’t even look towards them.
He said his death was a great injury for them, but they had to go into it: \"This generates a big hole in the family.\"
It's leading to tears.
But we all have to continue and fight.

The future of Bret Kavano, on the backslide of the FBI, starts the investigation.
“I thought that if we could do what he asked of us -- time-limited investigation -- within limited limits -- we could do some kind of unity -- said Mr. Flux on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be disillusioned on the fore of a party chip.
Why did Mr. Kavallo not want to investigate FBI and its supporters?
They don't want to have time.
Interim elections will take place in five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans’ case will go badly, they will seriously weaken in attempts to get the person they should choose from in the country’s highest court.
George Bush took the phone and called the Senators and lobed them to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House during Bushtime, and that he met his wife Ashley when he worked as a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI will prepare its account?
The elections will be held in the Senate where 51 Republicans are currently sitting and 49 democracys.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavano will receive at the Senate meeting with at least 50 votes allowing Vice President Mike Penn to terminate the union and prove it to the Supreme Court.
The Bible says: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection
After Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of apostates from North Korea has decreased from North Korea to South Korea, said South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, based on the South Union's data, reported last year, was 1,127 apostates, compared to 2,706 apostates in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the tightening of border control between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by the counterbanidists were significant factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of apostates from the north are eventually offered to be a citizenship of South Korea.
In Seoul, it is said that more than 30,000 North Korean borders have been illegally crossed after the Korean war in 1953
Most of the Chinese run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the reliable DMZ (DMZ).
China views apostates as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced repatriation.
The relationship between the northern and the southern states that are still in the state of war has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met with each other for negotiations in Piongang, focusing on suspended nuclear disarmament.
This happened in Singapore after a historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Yun, when they generally agreed to work on the Korean unilateral Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rie Yong-Hom accused US sanctions because of lack of progress from that time.
- Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally disarmament - said Mr. Riem in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavano’s hysterical, saying that he was not suitable for working at the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano, a hysterical, saying he is not suited to work at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelos made a comment on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t, but I think if a woman behaved as her own, she was called hysterical,” Palos said about her reaction to the Canadian testimony against the Senate’s Committee of Justice.
Kawagnah emotionally denied accusations that he had sexual intercourse with Dr. Kristina Blede in his youth.
His introduction to the speech was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and drowning at his family and talking about his school period.
He also unambiguously condemned the democracies in the Committee and called the charges that he had been accused -grotesque and coordinated murder of characters - organized by liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos stated that in his opinion, the testimony of Kavano confirmed that he would not work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is biased against democracy.
“I think he will disqualify himself with these statements and the way he went after Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
Pelos was worried when he was asked whether he would try to kill the impeachment if he was exaggerated, and whether the Democrats would accept the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so -- if he doesn’t tell the truth of a congress or FBI, then he isn’t suitable not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which he is now,” Pelos said.
Kachino is currently a district court of appeal in Colombia.
Pelos added that, as a democracy, he is concerned about Kavano’s potential decisions against an affordable medical aid law or Roy W. Weidi as he is considered a conservative judge.
In regard to the issue of approval of his position, Kavano has avoided questions about whether he will cancel any decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time when hysterical, biased people come to court and have an expectation that we’ll say ‘how wonderful it is,’ Pelos said.
And women should use this.
It's a fair conversation, for months and years of lack of anger, and it can't show it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” he said, “but we cry after 45 years.
-I do not think it's unusual to you -
He continued: “I really helped one woman who was somewhere in government who said she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she tells the man who was talking to her: “You may think I’m bored because I cry.
I'm angry with you.
And then he just continued his way.
And I thought it's wonderful.”
Tears are allowed to partly express anger because it is fundamentally incorrect.
One of my bitterest memories of early work, where men dominated me was when I once discovered that I was crying because of indescribable anger, an elderly lady knocked me on a kecho -- a cold manager who always feared me -- and I was crying on my stairs.
He said, \"I'll never see you cry,\" he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're bored, and they'll be happy that they got what they wanted.
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a marriage without having a marriage, on a boat called Monkey Business, and left Asparez, Ms. Schroeder, very disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he should not hold his candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
-A child was already a candidate, the least wanted to add another candidate.
Someone said, \"Phyphasia and son of the dwarf\"
Since the campaign was already late, and turned behind the fundraising campaign, he promised that he would not participate in the show, unless he collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave him only 250 dollars.
“They think I get a discount, they wondered about it.
When he came out with a word saying that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported, disappointment in the system that made it difficult to find funds and focused on voters, rather than on delegates, and brazi about sexism -- that he was brazzy.
“You think I had a nervous crisis,” said Ms. Scheder, quoted earlier, as a reaction to the press.
-You thought Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will you write about my tomb stone?
“He cried,” he said.
How can China be good for U.S.-China Trade War
The initial reasons for the war between the US and China have been deteriorating, and before the end of the fight is far further away, the fevers between countries in the long run can be beneficial for Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, took the first warning at the beginning of this year by setting up taxes for major Chinese exports, including solar panels, foil and alumin.
The most important escalation began this week, with new tariffs that influenced the items worth 200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxed what, half of all the goods that enter the U.S. into China.
Beijing reacted at a rate of between five and ten percent of U.S. tariffs each time.
China has promised the United States will face the eyeball, and the second-largest economy in the world is unlikely to be blinking at any time in the near future.
For Washington, compulsion means satisfying demand, but it could be very embarrassing for Chinese President Si Dzinpin.
However, experts say, if Beijing's battles are right to draw its cards, the US trade war pressure can positively affect China within a long time by reducing the relationship between two economics.
The fact that the rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions to start an economic decline in any country is actually much more dangerous than the observers were taken away earlier,” claims the studyer, associated with Asia at the New American Security Center, an analytical centre.
Syria's 'ready' to get refugees, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said
Syria states it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and ask for help to re-establish a war-torn country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wald al-Musele stated that the conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation is more stable on the ground and thanks to the progress in combating safe terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues rehabilitation of the territories destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
Now are all conditions to make voluntary return of refugees to a country that has to be left behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have been released from the country since the 2011 war.
Six million other people in the country need humanitarian assistance
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to help re-establish the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not receive conditional assistance from the countries that were funded by the rebels.

He handed a torch to his fellow John Ram, who won two and one of the players in the U.S. golf legend on Sunday.
(Laughter) I feel an incredible pride that I lost Tager Woods, I grew up with the ears of this guy -- Rahma, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has 13-21-3 record of the Rider Cup.

This morning, there was a moment when Europe was a little sunk.
We destroyed it.
We see the mountain before Thomas
It's a beautiful captain.
All of his 12 players played well.
We're regrouped, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Raider Cup Committee, and we're going ahead.
