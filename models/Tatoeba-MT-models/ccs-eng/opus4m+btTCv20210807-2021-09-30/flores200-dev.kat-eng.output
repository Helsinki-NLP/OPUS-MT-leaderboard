Stars release light and heat by means of energy obtained by mixing hydrogen atoms (or synthesis), to obtain more severe elements.
Scientists work on creating a reactor that generates energy as well.
But this issue is still very difficult to solve, and it will take many years to resolve it before we look at the production of useful reactors.
Steel needles will float on water due to surface tension.
Because the water molecules on the surface of the water link together with the strong attraction, more than the above molecules have surface tensions.
On the surface of the year, the water molecules form an impregnated membrane, which provides a weaves of needle-like objects on the water.

To get back to the previous energy level, they need to get rid of the extra energy that comes from light.
That's the light particle, they're doing it with light rays.
This process is called the “emission stimulated by radiation, because bright light stimulates atoms, resulting in light release, and light represents a kind of kind of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms that emit photons. In fact, it is obvious that photons are much smaller than they are shown in the picture.
The photons are smaller than the particles made of an atom!
After several hundred hours of work on the lamp, the lamp is gradually burning and the lamp is stopped working.
The lamp needs to be replaced later. When replacing the lamp, caution measures are required.

With such teeth, triceptops were able not only to eat leaves, but also to play solid branches and roots well.
Some scientists believe that the tricerates ate Saganada, which is a species of plants, and were common in the chalk period.
These plants are like a small palm tree that has a crown of sharp and wet leaves.
Most likely, the tricerapus used his powerful nose to get rid of the leaves from the stem before eating it.
Other scientists claim that even today, lazy and other animals such as parrots ( descendants of dinosaurs) are served with poisonous leaves or fruits, so it is unlikely that the dinosaurs were used as food.
How would Yo’s attraction affect me? If you were standing on the surface of Yo, your weight would be less than that of being on earth.

The sun has no bark that can stand like the Earth. The sun is made up of gas, fire, and plasma from the beginning.
The sun’s distance from the center becomes thinner
The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called a photograph, which means “the ball of light.”
In 1610, about three thousand years later, Galileo Galileo, an Italian astronomer, discovered that there are phases like the moon.
The phases are due to the fact that Venus (or Moon) is just the side of the lights that look at the sun, and the theory of Copernicus that planets rotate around the sun proves that Venus's phases exist.

The drawback of approach lenses is that the number of lens elements needed to achieve the focus and focus length range has much more than fixed lens lenses.
The problem is less than that, how many lens manufacturers meet higher standards in the production of lenses.
This allowed the zoom object to create images of quality that are not cut off with fixed focus-length lenses.
One of the factors of the Zum lens is that, as a rule, the maximum diaphragm of the lens is low.
This makes it difficult for the use of cheap-eyed lenses without lighting under low lighting conditions.

“Nevrological syndrome with triad of classical defining symptoms such as impulses, distraction of attention and hyperactivity, or the abundance of energy, is attention deficiency syndrome.
This is a violation of learning ability, not restriction of learning ability, but “from 3 to 5 percent of children and maybe more than 2 million American children”
Children with attention deficit syndrome find it difficult to concentrate on things such as schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things that they enjoy, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoons or writing without punctuality.
These children often get into trouble because for stimulating their brains, “they behave dangerously, quarreled and questioned, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
