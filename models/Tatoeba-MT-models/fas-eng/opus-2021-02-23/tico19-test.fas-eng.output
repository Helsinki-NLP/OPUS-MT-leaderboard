The spread of mass spread fast to the disease of Corona-19 virus (coved/19) in the European Union/Healing Area of Europe and England, January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The spread of prevalence of the Corona virus (coved-19) shows the same process in the European Union and the United Kingdom, while in different countries, we are in different stages of dissolving, but the Podmmy Coveid-19 is moving quickly throughout all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, other countries, hospitals and special care departments, they must increase their willingness to increase the number of patients with CO2-19 who need special health care and special care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases were reported for unknown causes in Wuhan Province of Hubi, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Control Center and Prespiration of China's diseases reported the cause as a new type of chroma virus, called the Crona virus's acute breathing syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called the Corona virus (coid-19).
The evidence that has been obtained so far shows that about 80% of people with CO2-19 have a mild disease, which means that the infection of the breathing system with or without the organic nature of it will improve most of these cases.
About 14 percent of cases, Koved-19 becomes a more powerful disease that needs to be hospitalized while six percent experience critical condition, which requires special care.
The death of the patients in the hospital is about 4% due to CO2-19%.
In this study, we will evaluate the spread process of the Corona virus in every EU/EA region (EU/EA) and England (Bretania) and compare it to the province of Hobi, China.
We also compare the current number of cases in the European Union/EEA and England countries with its number in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Coved-19 virus cases in the European Union/EEA and England
After China, Koved-19 was released in a much larger period, and the dynamicity of this disease follows this country all over the world now.
On March 11, 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Koved-19 was a Podmi.
In the magazine "Eursorvellance" on March 5, 2020, S.S.T.I.E.L.E.L.D.E.L.L.D., the first confirmed case in Europe based on the definition of the World Health Organization.
In the European Union/EEA, three confirmed reports were reported on January 24, 2020 of the people who had returned from Wuhan Province of Hubi, China.
On March 15, 2020, some cases were identified in all Europe/EA and England, with which from December 31 to that day, 39,78 confirmed deaths reported that 17, 750 were confirmed and 150 deaths were reported only in Italy.
Get the number of groupings and continuitys of the 19-19s
At the European Consistent Center (EDC), the cases of COD-19 are available in different countries around the world, only official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National Department of Health and the World Health and Health Organization, which are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate the flows of Coveid-19 in the European Union/EEA and England and compare it with the process of disease in Italy.
As a indicator for the spread of active states of Coved-19, we calculated the spread rate of Koveid-19 cases over 14 days, and as a result of the natural period of Koved-19 in the European Union/EA and England was considered to be in January 1 through March 15, 20.
It was also compared to the number of cases announced from each country on March 15, 2020 a.m. at 8:00 a.m., from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Koveid-19 in the European Union/EEA and England
The 14-day spread process of the Koveid-19 cut off into the European Union/EA and British countries is generally followed by Hubi Province (Zin) form 1.
Generally, for the European Union/EEA and Britain, Koveid-19 began to increase at about 21 February and then increased at about 28 February 2020 (the period of fulfillment).
This is especially due to the increasing increasing number of reports reported from Italy, but other EU countries/EA and England have shown a similar increase in the Coveid-19 spread.
The form of 2 shows the number of cases in the European Union/EA/EA and England compared with the cases of disease in Italy for the period of 31 January to March 15, 2020.
On March 15, 8 a.m., the total number of cases reported in 15 other European Union/EA and England are compared to the number of cases in Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases is increasing quickly in the European Union/EEA and England.
The process seen in the Coved-19 population shows that this pammy is currently progressing at nearly the same speed in almost every country.
While countries are in different stages of disease, the response of public health organizations is also different, and there may also be different protocols and protocols in countries to choose patients to be tested for confirmation of CO2-19 testing.
In early March 2020, doctors described a situation where about 10% of patients with CO2-19 needed special care, and the media sources reported that hospitals and special care areas in these areas had reached their maximum capacity.
The information on acceptance of the following cases is available at the hospital or special care services of the EU/EEA in order for only 6% and 1% of cases (that are not shown).
In order to complete current surveillance data focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deads, this information must be collected in systemic way.
The study that was done during 11–2010 showed that access to special care sheets in Europe is very different from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
It means that countries may have less or more resources than Italy (12.5 seats of special care and middle care for every 100,000 population in the year 11–2010).
The modeling process for health care capacity has been provided with estimates for different EU countries/EAA and the United Kingdom who have been placed in the hospital in connection with the occupation of the occupation of 90% of the capacity of special care levels, on the sixth day of the ECCC-19 risk assessment.
Since the disease is classified in certain areas of Europe/EA and England, hospitals and special care areas usually serve the population of a region, so the information on the cases and special care tables must be available in the list of areas for a statistical level 2 (NTS 2 - 2).
Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that Pondmi Koveid-19 is progressing quickly in the European Union/EA and England.
So hospitals and special care units must prepare themselves for a stable SARS-CoV-2 transfer scenario and increase the number of patients with Koved-19 who need special care, such as the state in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECD risk assessment, a quick approach, precipitating the development of SARS-COV-2 is required by changing quickly from the restraining approach, since a quick increase in the number of cases if not so soon may cause decision-making authorities and hospitals to not have enough time to understand, accept, and respond based on this process.
A quick risk assessment lists public health measures to reduce the effect of this pandm.
A brief opportunity for the remaining countries to increase control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure to health care.
The failure of this is likely to confront other EU/EA health care care systems with a wave of patients who will need special care in the next days or weeks.
The outbreak of the Corona virus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 3,000 people's death and infected 80000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which is a disaster for mankind.
SARS-CoV-2, like his similar virus, Sars, which caused thousands of people in 2003, may have been transferred from bats and created similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, Koved-19 is less severe than Sarus, severe and death rate, but it is more capable of transporting older people than young people and men.
In response to many of the material published about this disease, this article is trying to provide a timely and comprehensive examination of this research subject that is quickly spreading.
We'll cover the basic principles about epidemiology, genetics, virusology, diagnosis, treatments, ads, and preservation of this disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review article helps understand and solve this deadly disease.
On 25 January 2020, the Spring Festival became an unrecognizable memory for all Chinese who had to stay at home because of the spread of a new virus disease and several weeks later.
This virus is very similar to the Corona virus (SARS) which caused the spread of hyper-symnia syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named on February 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) as SARS-CoV-2, and the disease was related to it.
It began in Wuhan China and quickly spread across the country and about 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, over 80,000 confirmed Koveid-19 reported that over 40,000 patients were released and died more than 3,000 patients.
The World Health Organization warned that Koveid-19 was "the enemy of the number one people" and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
On the basis of the Ptttpsvwwww.cb.nnh.gnh/pbo/pmed/, since the first report on January 7, 2020 in less than 200 months, more than 200 articles including coved-19 virus, epidemology, diagnosis, diagnosis, and treatment have been published that have determined the sequence of the virus separated from several patients.
In this article, we're trying to gather the development of research in this new field and quickly developing.
If possible, we will try to compare Coved-19 with SARS and other disease caused by CoV, Middle East breathing syndrome (MRS), which he found in 2012.
We will also discuss cases that we've learned about prevalence and treatment and some other necessary questions.
CoVs were traditionally considered to be non-automatic ptsis for humans, which led to about 15 percent of normal colds.
But in this century, we've met two times with very, very human human beings, SARS-CV and MERS-CV, which spread disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries.
Thus, the current Koved-19 is the third prevalence in human history.
As shown in the form of 1.1, a branch of non-recognative cases was first reported to the Chinese National Health Committee on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death was reported by Wuhan.
At the same time, it spread quickly into cities, provinces and countries around the world.
On January 20th, health care box was reported and showed that human transport was possible.
On 23 January, the inhabitants of Wuhan were quarantined and public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease was reported to be confirmed by 41 patients, only 21 people made direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Food market, which was considered to be the start of an infection from an unknown animal source.
The World Health Organization announced the spread on January 30, a global health situation.
As long as this report is provided, this disease has spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world.
Because the situation is changing quickly, the final domain and the severe spread of the disease is still a problem that needs to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study that was done at several centers on eight, 866 patients including 4,021 confirmed Koved-19 shows the image to the following description (htttpsm.wmm.wxin.k.k.com/lBi-HXXXxxx2Hbddd).
People with SARS-CoV-2 have different ages, but mostly 30 to 65 years old.
Almost half of the infected people (4.7.7%) were over 50 years old, very few, less than 20 years old, and only 14 people with less than 10 years of age.
Men with SARS-CoV-2 are more men (0.31/10000) than women (0.27/10000).
In various clusters, Koved-19 spread largely in Hoby and around it.
The beginning period was about 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average period of disease was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The beginning period to the death was 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base line number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.59.05) and R0 set 2.2 to 4.8.
The number of people with severes were increasing before January 23, 2020, which corresponds to the crowded time of transportation before the spring festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases (95%:1.10-1.86%) and the death rate of all patients was 3.1% (95%:2.024.59%).
The three major factors of danger for Coved-19 included gender (man), age (over 60 years) and severe occupation.
The CoVs are a family of large and un-fault virus that contains a single string of emotional RNA.
The virus can be divided into four alphas, betas, Gamma and Deltas, which determine the species of Alphas and CoVs can be humanized.
The gluquistin (S) is connected to the host cell Angitin (AE2) and converts the oscillator 2 (AEE2) and DPP4 (DP4) in order for SARS-CV and MERS-CV and MCV.
The virus's genome is released in cyttoxium; after the virus's genome, the RNA forms a genome with gluquistin laf, and the nucleotide protein containing verion, which will then be connected to the plasma artery to release the virus.
The first genome sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
With a genetic match of over 99/98% of the sequences gathered from the main location of the spread, the Huhan Sea Food market in Wuhan, it turns out that SARS-CV-2 is a new form of occupants-CVV2.
SARS-CoV-2 is more geneticly similar to SARS-CoV to MERS-CVV.
The SARS-CoV-2 particles were found through the analysis of the translust part of the human air channel.
It turns out that human AE2 is acting as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVV.
However, the S protein is more weak than SARS-CoV-2, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 creates less infection than SARS-CVV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encrypted by eitherf3b and a secret protein encrypted by orf8.
ORF3B may be involved in a virus disease, i.e., i.e., i., i.e.
On February 18, 2020, Zhoo and the colleagues reported the structure of the ACE2 humans with full length of 2.9 it was in combination with amino acid BAT1.
They found that this compound, which had open and closed smileings, was combined as a demer, and the combination of AE2-BAT1 can connect two protein S that could be evidence of the identification of CoV and infection.
B0AT1 can become a medical target for a cure for a cure to suppress the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Middle host origin
It turns out that the source of SARS-CV and MERS-CoV were both bats and were transferred to humans in an order through the Seiot cat and camel.
By comparison, the SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the native host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to the two co-stressis of Sars, which is from SL-CZX45 and SL-CVZX2121.
However, the question of what middle host has helped the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect humans is still unresolved, and the transport path still requires more obvious.
Jay and colleagues believe that snakes contain the same combination within S protein have acted as virus carriers of bats to humans.
According to one study, researchers in Gongjo China, based on the 99% genetic species discovered in Kagolin and SARS-CoV-2, announced that perhaps eating Pagulin -- some kind of long-smalled ant with a long shell used in traditional Chinese medicine -- as a potential inter-massed host of SARS-CV-2-2.
However, 1% of the difference that has been developed in two genomes is still very different; therefore, we are still waiting for certain results for solid evidence (the form of 33).
SARS-CoV-2 physics features are still too unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CV are living in dry environments until 48 hours and at temperature 20 degrees of centigrade, and at 40 to 50 percent per day in lab conditions such as live in lab conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the digital radiation and temperature of 56 degrees of centigrade for 30 minutes, Ether, Ethol 75%, anti-symbiotic materials containing Claire, pharmoic acid, and other oils other than reservation, and can effectively disable this virus.
The human population generally does not have immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and therefore is prone to this new virus.
There is currently no detailed study of the ionological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only look at previous studies about other CVs, especially SARS-CV and MERS-CoV.
In general, after the virus attacks the host's cell, it is first known by the host's immune system through the pattern recognition receivers (PRRs), including substrates of C type C, substraters (TLR), NLD (NLR), and an IRG-IR receiver (RRR).
The virus, through various paths, will cause the insurgency, growth of denarithtic cells and St. IFNs, which will limit the spread of the virus and speeds it into the anti-virus gene.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help escape the virus from the immune system.
The immune system will soon join the virus.
The T is the most important role in defense, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
CD4+ T cells drive B cells to produce specific virus enzymes, and CD8 + T cells directly kill infected cells.
T-help cells help to defend cells to produce pre-sytokins.
However, CoV can control the function of the T cell by insulation T cells.
Hamoral safety also includes backups such as C3A and C5 and anti-virus in combat against viral infections.
For example, antibiotics separated from the patient, preventing the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the extreme reaction to the immune system is to produce a large number of free occupants in a position that can lead to severe relieved lungs and other organs and at worst causes multiple organs and even deaths.
SARS-CoV-2, which is the feature of the growth of the chest, often affects the elderly with ground disease and pregnant women.
The common thing is that people who are exposed to a large amount of virus or their immune system is weak, more likely to be infected than others.
According to the study, the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the period of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by 14-1 days, but often it takes 3 to 7 days.
However, the study on 1,099 shows that the period of deformation is average three days, and in time is zero to 24 days.
More recent study shows, as described above, the period is 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days) based on statistics of 8.6.
This is very important to the health authorities to determine the time of effective quarantine based on the most accurate period of disintegration, thus preventing virus transfer from infected people who have no symptoms.
One common method is that people exposed to a virus or infected virus usually have to be quarantined 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended for 24 days?
The fever is often the primary sign of Coved-19, which can be associated with or without a mark or with other symptoms such as the dry cough, the pain of the breath, the pain of the head, the headache, the throat, the throat, the throat, the nose, the swelling, the nausea, the nausea, and the nausea.
Some patients had a week after the disease began, breathing pain or oxygen loss in tissues.
In severe cases, the disease is quickly moving towards the creation of hypertension syndrome, shocks, acidism, and blood disorder.
Patients with fever, breathing symptoms, and severe fever, even without lung disease in radioology images must be diagnosed for early recognition of the virus.
A population study at the end of December 2019 percent shows this: 98% of the fever, 98% of the dry cough, 55% of the pain of breath and 3% of diabetes; 8% of the patients needed a vanatator.
The same findings were reported in the last two studies of a family branch and a chest due to a transfer from a single person without a mark.
In the study of populations done in 2012, it was shown that in patients with MERS-CoV, fever (98%), dry cough (4%) and shortness of breath (55%) is seen as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed a vanalator, which is much more likely to indicate the death of MERS than Coved-19 patients.
It was seen in the MERS patients (26%) and the throat of pain (21%).
The patient with SARS has been shown that fever (99.00%), dry cough (29 to 75%), breathing pain (40 to 42%), diabetes (20%) and gludre (13 to 25%) were the main symptoms, and about 20% of the homeless needed the vanthator.
By February 14, and when confirmed cases on the surface of the world reached 66,77 cases, the percentage of death was about 2%.
In contrast, the death rate of SARS was confirmed by November 2002 about 10 percent of 8.96.
Based on a population study in June 2012, the percentage of death was calculated for MRS 37% of confirmed 2.4%.
One previous study shows that R0 is related to SARS-CoV-2 to 6.7% of its confidence (CI) is about 5.7 to 7.23, while the range of R0 for SARS-CoV is only from 2 to 4.7.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 is presented with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV, with symptoms, death rate, and R0 in table 1.
High image shows that SARS-CoV-2 is more capable of spreading than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoVVV, but the SARS-CoV-2 is less than the MARS-CVVV and SARS-CVVV.
Thus, all SARS-CoV-2 control is much harder than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoVV.
The beginning of a chest is often happening in a family or from a gathering place or a vehicle such as a Cruz ship.
Patients often have had a history of travel or residence in Vahan or other infected areas or contacting infected persons.
However, it has been reported that people can be more than two weeks of virus without symptoms, and that patients are healed and released from the hospital can again transfer this virus, which is a warning to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (for example, in patients) is natural or low.
For example, Limpovia's state with less white blood count than 4x109/L contains fewer count of the count of 1x109/L, and the levels of aminostial aminos, and the presence of the virus in the blood was seen at 1,00% patients with CO2-19.
The levels of liver and insomnia and mioglobin were increasing in the blood of some patients, and the protein of C and red blood cells often increased.
In patients with severe cases, the D level, which is the result of the destruction of the fibers in the blood, has increased, and the number of Lenfus slowly decreases.
It is seen in the chest radiobiography images in most of the patients of Coved-19, and is the feature of the two-part shadow of the meth glass in the lungs.
In most patients, non-sacrificial nature is caused by severe lung damage and acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, non-intelligence risk a person's air exchange of fluids and advanced fibers.
The I type I and I function disorder in the penotops reduces the surface of the surprise and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the lung's ability to develop, and increased the risk of lung failure.
So the worse the radar findings of the chest is, the larger the disease is.
On February 18, 2020, the first analysis of Coveid–19 showed that the chromatization of the penotots, the formation of glass, the influence of an eyeology, and the cells of multiple fluids in the lungs that have passed away due to the disease of the virus, and the SARDS, and similar to the patients of SARS and MS.
Recognization of SARS-CoV-2 was used by the reaction of a reverse-roving chain (RCR) as the main standard of Coveid-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate of this method, which may speed up epidemia, on 13 February 2020, the use of clinical symptoms (which were not just relying on occupants) began to detect disease in China.
There was a similar situation to detect the SARS.
Thus, a combination of history of disease, clinical symptoms, lab tests, and radioological findings is necessary to have an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Hong Kong Group offered a protocol using the "CISPR" method to identify SARS-CoV-2, which detects the parts of the RARS-CV-2 on 20 x 18-18 Mol/L to 200 ml/L (10 to 100 copies of the input) using a tape at less than an hour without a price.
There's hope that a new approach if it's confirmed in clinical samples can in a remarkable way increase carefulness and comfort in the experiment.
According to the lack of experience on this new CV type, doctors can primarily offer support care care for COD-19 patients, while various treatments that are used to improve others such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV and other viral diseases (JD2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with anti-virus medications, immune treatments, steroids, steroids to improve patients, Chinese medicine and mental support.
Even plasma was suggested to improve patients for treatment.
The drug companies are competing for production of enzymes and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 often attacks lungs, and may have weaker attacks on other organs with AE2, such as the immune system and kidneys.
However, the function disorder and failure of the breathing system is the most important risk of people's patients and cause of death.
So, breathing support for symptoms is vital and saves the person's life, which can be very largely involved in public health care, oxygen with high current, non-intensive ventrator, and an insurgent mechanical van.
Patients with severe breathing symptoms have to be supported by explical explic oxygen (ECMO), this method is a modified heart-repliced technique used to treat heart failure or breathing failure.
In addition, it is essential to maintain electromagnetic balance, preventment, and treat secondary infection and shock and protect vital organs in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It turns out that the cytokin storm is due to the extreme reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The Cytokin storm is a systemic response that includes a set of cytokins, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN6, IFN, IFN, IFN, and MCP-1.
This cytokin induces the immune cells to spread a large number of free radicals, which is the main cause of the ARDS and multi-partion failure.
The immune system is essential in treatment of Cytokin storms, especially in patients with a critical condition.
The corticosteroids and tocilizimab, which is an anti-IL6 anti-I6 anti-I6 anti-IL6 anti-sytokkin.
Other treatments to suppress the immune system to prevent the storm of Sytokin are the metrollation of the immune response guided by T-cells; IFN-12, IL-1 and TNF; JAK Control; Belitomb; the suppressor for sending signs of cytokin 4 and HDAC controls.
Stredoids were widely used as immune treatments in the treatment of SARS to reduce the intravenous injury.
However, the use of steroids in high doses was not useful in severe lung damage to patients with SARS and Coveid-19.
However, it may cause severe side effects, especially the sound of styoncroze and has a significant negative effect on the recovery of the disease.
However, short periods of use of corticosteroids are recommended in low and middle doses to be carefully used for patients with CO2-19 in critical condition.
When writing this, no effective anti-virus treatment has been confirmed for this disease.
However, it turns out that the involvement with remsvirer, a non-noototide analog, has been effective in an American patient with CO2-19.
Remsvir is a new anti-virus drug produced by Giled in the beginning to treat the diseases caused by Abula and Marlburg.
Later, the possible control of the other RNA virus was shown a single string, including the MERS and SARS virus by remdsvire.
According to this, Giled sent the combination to China to conduct some experiments in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and was very promising.
In addition to this, interferon-e.g., Lupinavier/Rytonavier and Rabiin have been proposed as a potential treatment for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
It can occur after treatment with Lupinavir/ritonier.
It must be carefully watched with other medications used in patients.
Plassy received from patients recovered and produced antibiotics
Taking blood from patients who have been healed from a contagious disease has a long history of treatment for other patients who suffer from the same disease or protecting healthy people from the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have a relatively high-intensive anti wind to deal with the cause of disease.
The antibiotics are Immonogbolin, which are produced by L's Lenosphitis to fight the causes of disease and other foreign objects, and recognize unique molecules in the trogens and disarm them directly.
On the basis of this, the plasma was received from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from Koved-19 and was given to 10 ill patients.
Their symptoms were healed within 24 hours, which were associated with the loss of infection and viral load and the recovery of oxygen in the blood.
However, before certain treatments are presented, this method requires confirmation and transparency on a large scale.
In addition, due to the effects of treatment, some of the symptoms associated with plasma must be considered carefully.
For example, anti winds can over-exist the immune response and create Sytokin's release syndrome, which is potentially a life-massing poison.
It is usually low in blood, and the demand for plasma is too much for patients to treat.
It is difficult to create and generate a fast-on-the-art, which is enough to fight global electromagnetism.
So B cells are more important and more effective than improved patients and detecting genetic code of the coder's code, or the form of effective enzymes than the original virus protein.
So, we can increase the production of enzymes quickly.
It has been used for thousands of years to treat different kinds of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend much on the combination of different components in the formula, depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the ATM theory.
Most of its effective components are still unknown or vague, because it is difficult to extract and confirm these components or their optimization.
At the moment, the ATM has become one of the important treatments for patients with mild symptoms or patients with average symptoms or those who have recovered from difficult stages.
For example, Shu Fung's capsules were identified as a effective treatment for Koveid-19.
Most treatments were seen in several provinces of China, where they used ATM for 8% of patients, including Gonoso (3.7%), Naingia (50%), and Hanan (50%). In the province of Hobi, only 30 percent of the patients used QWM (13%).
However, this comparison is not entirely true, because many factors, such as the number of patients and the strongness of patients, have to be considered.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zaang and his colleagues published a study of the comparison of Western treatment (WM) and the combined WM treatment.
They found that the time required to recover the body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalized by WM+TCM was much shorter than the group that was treated only with WM.
More amazing, the rate of the disease symptoms (in the WM+TCM) was lower than the WM group (7.4% v. 46.2%) and the death rate in the WM+TCM was lower than the WM group (8% against 39%).
However, ATM's performance and safety still waits for better tests controlled on larger scales and greater centers.
It is also a matter of whether or not it is possible to determine the practical mechanism and determine the effective components of the method of treatment of the ATM treatment or their compounds.
Suspects or infected patients have a lot of fear of this disease and even deadly, and quarantined persons are also insufferable, lonely, and angry.
In addition, the symptoms of this infection, such as fever, hypoxy, cough and side effects such as sleepless corticosteroid can lead to more mental anxiety.
At the first stage of the SARS spread, types of psychological effects include severe depression, anxiety, nervous attacks, psychological stress, mental symptoms, even suicide.
The tracking of the call required and quarantine, as part of the public health system to deal with the prevalence of the Koveid-19 virus, can cause people to be troubled and blamed for the effects of the origins, quarantine, and exposure among their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care must be provided for Kwaid-19 patients, suspicious people, people in contact with them and all the people in need.
Mental support should include creating groups of mental health groups from various fields, clear communication with regular updates about the SARS-CoV-2 process and medical designs and using professional equipment and applications to prevent close contact.
The effective vaccines are required to cut off the transfer chain from the population of animals and infected humans, and are often used as a backup method to treat anti-virus in control of infections due to developing virus.
There have been attempts to make vaccines based on protein S to produce strong, permanent, and permanent, and protection against SARS-CV.
Living vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the effect of these vaccines in older people and severe deadly models and their protection against common virus infections between humans and animals must be determined before the clinical study begins.
This is probably because Sarus was rooted 17 years ago and since then no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, MERS scattered cases and branches are still seen in the Middle East, and due to the resources of moving animals to humans in local areas, they spread to other areas.
Vaxination routes were provided for the MERS using disabled virus, DNA plasma, virus failures, nano-massing particles, virus particles, and some of them have been evaluated in animal models.
The production of a secure and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-humans is an essential and vital task for anti-interference control.
However, it is difficult to overcome this problem due to a long period of time required to produce a vaccine (i.e., the average of 18 months) and the dynamic changes in different types of CoV.
As a new disease, Koved-19 has started showing a full clinical period among thousands of new patients.
In most cases, patients are gradually healed.
However, such as SARS and MERS, the Koveid-19 virus is also associated with high effects and death in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a predictive flow model is necessary for health and health organizations to put their services first, especially in the limited areas.
Based on the studies of the clinic reported, the following factors can affect the predictive flow of the Kwaid-19 patients:
Age: The age was the most important factor in the SARS flow, which is also true to the Coved-19.
Coved-19 is a major event at the age of 30 to 65; in a study that took place on eight, 866, it was determined that 47.4% of patients were over 50 years of age.
Patients who needed special care were more of a background effect and their age was older than those who didn't need special care (the average group of 66 and the average age of 215 years). This shows that age is a predictive factor in the flow of disease and the result is a result in Kwaved-19 patients.
gender: SARS-CoV-2 will cause more men to be infected than women (0.31/10000 vs. 0.27/10000), as described above.
Previous diseases and symptoms: patients with CO2-19, who need special care, were more likely to have a heart injury and aerthmia.
Heart events were also the cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be connected to ACE2-mormies and result in liver disorder in COD-19 patients.
It is necessary to say that age and disease are highly linked together and that they may interfere with each other.
In the blood, the protein levels of the C reaction have been suggested as a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
It is also suggested that CRP is inconsistent and predictive.
In addition to this increase the amount of dehydrogenate (LDH), the aminotranstrates (AAST), the amino aminothropian aminos (ALT) and the CK Kins can also help with predicting the results.
They are widely shown in multiple organs, especially in their heart and liver, and are released from tissue damage.
Thus, as traditional symptoms of heart disorder or liver disorder.
Original clinical symptoms: For predicting the results and effects of Coved-19, chest removing, and the development of clinical symptoms should be taken along with other problems.
The use of steroids: as at the top, steroids are the suppressor of the immune system, which is usually used as a treatment method for contagious diseases in order to reduce the injury.
Because the high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with SARS, many healed people suffer from the disease of ions with life-long disability and loss of quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids must be used with low doses and for a short period of time in Kwaid-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress since the prevalence of Koveid-19, because they've often been quarantined for a long time and have had severe confidence and witnessed the deaths of family members and patients of their roommates.
Mental advice and long-term support are essential for helping these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to the population studies that have been done so far, it seems that the ideological properties of Coved-19 are different from SARS.
The SARS-CoV-2, in addition to re-integrating in the lower breathing device, can effectively be re-resolved in the super-servation system, and at the first stage of infection, have mild or small symptoms, and similar to other CVs that cause common cold.
Thus, patients with the first stage or insurgency can produce a lot of virus during daily activities that can make it difficult to control this epidemia.
However, the transfer of SARS-Covo took place when patients were extremely ill and at the initial stage of the disease did not occur.
Thus, the Coveid-19 is much more powerful than the SARS outbreak, and it is more difficult to control.
There are currently many attempts in China, including banning homes in the city of Hanhan and the cities around the city and quarantineing the entire population with almost the loss of the SARS-CoV-2 transfer chain.
However, these actions have severely damaged the economy and other parts of the country, but the number of new patients has been reduced, and it shows that this disease is slowing down.
The happiest estimate is that the disease will end by March, and the virus's transmission process will continue for 3 to 4 months.
However, some of the other experts are not very happy.
Paul Henter and colleagues estimate that Koved-19, which seems to be basically more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues have established a model for predicting the result of this epidemi, and they believe that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in the middle-of-the-boxerial substrate of patients who had left the hospital two weeks ago, which shows that the newly identified virus could be turned into a similar cycle disease with flu.
However, there are promising symbols in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases that show that current strategy may be working.
At first it was predicted that Abola would cause one million people and half a million people to die.
However, through quarantine and severe separation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CV, SARS-CoV-2 is weaker in terms of the disease, and eventually it's gone, or it's turned into a virus with a low gene that lives next to humans.
The comparison of all Koveid-19 sequencing is shown below with SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 is very transmitted through cough or cough, and is likely transferred directly through contact with infected materials to the virus.
The virus is also found in the filth that provides the ability to transfer from filth to mouth.
A new study is reported on 138 cases where 41 percent of cases have been caused by hospital infection, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 people from the health services box.
Therefore, it is important to take great care of humans, especially in the health care box, in the family, in the family, in the colleagues, and even in contact with patients or people with this disease.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear the mask, which can also be used by surgical masks and N95 breathing masks, which will help control the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask prevents the flow of fluids spread by potential people through air or depending on the surface of the material where they can be transferred to others.
However, only N95 masks (1860) can protect a person from viral particles as much as 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5 percent of the virus particles can completely cross it; SARS-CV-2 is the size of SARS-CVVV and both are about 85 nanometers.
Because particles can even pass through five surgical masks that are facing each other, so the health care box that are directly in contact with patients should use N95 mask (1860), not the surgery mask.
In addition to the mask, the health care box should wear the stables to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect the person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes of his people.
Thus, the health box must also be used when working with the patients, with the visible object and glasses.
For the public in infected areas or potentially infected areas, it has been highly recommended that people wash their hands too often with anti-reparable soaps and try to stay at home and limit the connection to potential people.
The distance of three feet (one meters) is considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, it was very similar to SARS-CV reported on January 7, 2020 according to deep memories of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, by 19 January 2020, the head of the Wuhan Control Center, said that the new virus is low and that its transfer from humans is limited to humans and that there is no problem with preventing the disease.
This message has caused a significant loss of knowledge of danger among the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for spring festivals and the critical time to control this disease was lost on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
In China, disease control agencies may have learned a hard lesson from this and are doing fundamental improvement in the future.
For example, these organizations have to be more careful, given that every word spoken by health agencies is important to citizens and can change people's views and decisions; (2) Instead of waiting for official reports from doctors and authorities, they are more sensitive to the unusual information received from clinics; (3) instead of trying to encourage people to do more limited measures to control a potential disease in the early stages (4) and to increase the public knowledge of the treatment system, and in order to improve the treatment of society.
The prevalence of Koved-19 was started by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months and the time of writing, the virus has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and there are similar symptoms between Koved-19 and SARS, the prevalence has created the sense of the return of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between Coved-19 and SARS, which are necessary to know that it is necessary to control this epidemia and treat patients.
It affects older people more than young people and men than women, and the rate of death in older people is greater than young people.
SARS was greater than CO2-19 (10.9% v. 1.44%).
Patients with Koveid-19 are moving the virus even when they don't have symptoms, while patients with SARS were moving the virus when they were extremely ill, which made it harder to control Koved-19 than SARS.
This explains to some extent why SARS-CoV-2 was developed more and more broad than SARS-CovV.
The normal RNA experiment in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients.
On the other hand, treatment patients can be re-resolved with the virus and their test results are positive.
These findings are incredibly increased the risk of the spread of the virus.
According to such quick progress in the study of Koved-19, several important problems continue to be solved, which are based on the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
However, between SARS-CoV-2 and two Saruss such as bats around 96% geneticly, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is a bat.
What animal, as an interface, transferred the virus from the original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to questions of 1 and 2, we can't effectively cut off the transfer, and the spread of the disease may occur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemisting have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how does the virus get into breathing cells and cause the next changes depending on disease?
Is this virus connected to cells with ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can't get a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the spread continue?
How does the virus become geneticized during the transfer between humans?
Will this disease become a disease all over the world, like saris, slowly destroyed or return to a period like the flu?
The answer to the above questions may be necessary, but it may take some time to get the answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost may be, we have no choice but to stop all of this and bring our lives back to normal as soon as possible.
The animal origin of the human Cronos virus.
For thousands of years, adaptive and intensibility has caused the same evolution of the Corona virus (CoVs) and their host, including humans.
Before 2003, two human koVs were known as HCV (HCV) due to mild illness such as coldness.
==SARS==SARS and Middle East breathing syndrome showed how dangerous the HCV infection could be.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 at Central China in the late 2019s put the KVs back in focus and surprised us with his upper home, but the symptoms were smaller than his sister SARS-CV.
HCoV infection is a common disease between humans and animals, and knowledge of the animal origins of HCoVs helps us do good.
More origins are bats that don't cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as the middle tank of some HCVs are also known.
The identity of animal hosts has a direct effect on the preventing disease in humans.
In animals, an examination of the interactions of the host CoV can also provide important insight into the disease of the CV in humans.
In this study, we provide a review of knowledge about seven HCVs, with focus on their discovery history and animal origins and international transfers.
The important thing we're going to do is compare HCVs to the evolution of the virus and genetic noise.
The virus is discussed in the case of all of Corna's disease, and the virus is discussed in the 2019s.
In addition, the need for successful host change and viral evolution will be examined for the severe disease in this article.
Coronavieridae (CVs) are the family of the Coronavieridae, consisting of a group of left-of-of-the-art virus, with a positive palrium, and a single RNA.
These virus, which has the largest genome from 26 to 32 pounds in the RNA virus, is called "CoV", due to the eromology of the crown like them.
In terms of structure, the CoVs have a mutual genome that has a common structure.
Almost two-thirds of the genome consists of two large ps1 and OFB (ORFA and OFB), which are turned into p1 and pp1b protein.
The protein tube is more common and causes the production of 16 non-information proteins that are named "nsp1 to 16".
The remaining part of the genome consists of an EF that is used for structure proteins such as S (S), laphoff (E), corresa (M) and nucleotonin (N).
A number of side proteins that are special ancestors are encrypted by different ancestors of CoVs.
According to protein sequences, CoVs is classified into four species (alphia-CV, Alfa-CoV, Gmma-Coto-Coto-CV), which includes most of the HCVs and is divided into four races (A, C, C, and D).
Phillytic evidence shows that bats and flies act as a source of gene-CVs and co-CVs, while the birds are the main gmma-CVs and delta-CVs.
Over the thousands of years, the CoVs have continued to cross species barriers and some of them have appeared as important causes for humans.
To this day, seven humanCoVs (HCV) are known.
Among them are HCoV 229E and HCoV-NL63 of the type of Affa-CVV.
The five other five are HCV-HKU1, HCV-CCCCID, coronus of hypertension syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East Resorum syndrome (MRRS-CoV) and SARS-CV-2-2-2.
HCV-229E, HCoV-COCCID, HCoV-HKU1 and HCV-NL6 usually produce mild symptoms such as cold or diabetes.
In contrast, MERS-CV, SARS-CV and the new virus SARS-CoV-2 are highly ill, causing the infection of the substrate in most patients and most likely causing a hypertensive breathing syndrome (ARDS) and the presence of symptoms outside the lung.
The first generation of HCV-229E, known as B814, was separated from a common cold disorder in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, through extensive studies on HCV 229E and HCV-CCID, both of which make the symptoms limited.
In fact, this concept was widely accepted, which the HCVs were generally harmless until the SARS spread out.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003, which is one of the most destructive outbreaks in the present time, infected more than 8000 people, and the raw casualties were about 10 percent.
Ten years later, the spread of the Middle East Respiration (MRS) caused an outbreak of a total disease in the Saudi Ocean, which had spread across the world.
In 2019, the new HCV (2019-NCoV) which was later named SARS-CoV-2 was the factor of all the disease of Croona in 2019, which killed more than 3,20 people by March 20.
The alarm is playing, and the world has to prepare itself for all the infections of SARS-CoV-2.
Each seven HCV has an animal that includes bats, rats, or domestic animals.
There are several evidence that the evolutional origins of all the HCVs of bats are well-recognizable in these creatures and are present without symptoms of disease and have a lot of genetic variations.
The whole Coveid 19-19 takes great challenges to medicine, science, social and moralism for China and the world.
It provides a frame for understanding nature's natural history, the causes of the mutation of the species.
This may also include the search for tanks, the middle host, and the animal-consistent army of SARS-CoV-2, and has important effects in preventing all of the future.
In this study, we'll have a review of animal origins, interstrate between species and HCVs.
In particular, we consider the common issue in which the HCV parent virus in their natural environment is not normally a disease, but it is a disease after moving a species into a new host.
We will also consider the process of HCV evolution, where the increase in the virus's system is often associated with a decrease in the disease.
The current issue of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed.
We've been known to us since the late 1930s.
Before the initial separation of HCV-229E, the patient's noses were separated from common colds, KVs in various kinds of animals including turkeys, rats, pigs, cats, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
A brief sum of the history of HCV discovery in time (Jolol 1) can be significant and containing good information.
The first sequence of HCV-229E virus was sampled from the patient's breathing system with a hyper-symmmies infection, and then adapted to growth in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with HCV-229E had normal cold symptoms, including headaches, seizure, weakness, and throat pain, and fever and cough were seen at 10 to 20 percent.
Later in '67, HCoV - OC43 was separated from the growth of members in the lab, and eventually entered the brain of little rats.
It appears that HCoV-E4 is similar to the properties created by HCV-229 E, which are not known for symptoms of other breathing infections such as flu A and Reinviuss.
The HCoV - 229 and HCoV - OC43 have both been distributed worldwide and are generally transferred to the cool climate during the winter.
In general, the time for these two virus failures is less than a week, and after that, the disease takes about two weeks.
According to studies on human volunteers, healthy people who were infected with HCV-229E suffered a mild cold.
Only in a few immune patients, severe breathing infections were seen.
The SARS disease, also known as the "instreciation of the spades" is the first disease in human history that is responsible for SARS-CoV and is the third discovered HCV disease.
The first case of SARS can be traced to the Province of Gongdong in late 2002.
===SARS ===SARS outbreak caused 8,96 tons and left 747 dead and spread through many countries and continents.
Except for the extraordinary state of release, it's estimated that each patient can be infected almost two other cases, the period of debilitation appears four to seven days and the peak of a virus in 10 days.
Patients with SARS-CV were first suffering from an insinuity, headache, fever, weakness, and earthquake, and after that the fatigue of breath, coughs and breaths appeared as the next symptoms.
Lenfapini, the test for liver function, the loss of the liver, and the protégnosis, is the usual lab oscillation of SARS.
It is also seen in the disease of Sars' disease, and the increase in the cell's increase of microphages.
In addition, about 20 to 30 percent of the patients needed special care and mechanical ventators.
In addition to the substance system, multiple organs, such as the disease, liver, and kidney, were usually infected with a sytokin storm, which could be particularly deadly in patients.
The virus was first sampled during the open lung tissue operation, one of the patients who traveled from Goong Zong to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many attempts to investigate HCV.
In late 2004, HCV - NL6 was separated from a seven-month-old from the Netherlands.
It was first discovered that in children, elderly patients and people with health problems are common in breathing diseases.
The disease is common in HCoV - NL63.
In another independent study, the same virus separation is described from a sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from the nature of Al-Asali in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually spread to the world level.
It has been estimated that HCV - NL63 is the factor of about 4.7% of chronic diseases, and the peak of the spread in early summer, spring and winter.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with the hexulitis, also known as the chrome.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was placed in Hong Kong in the nature of Al-Sicsi and Brunish.
In addition to the occupants, HCV-HKU1 has been reported to have been associated with an asthma disease of an acute type.
Like HCV-NL63, HCoV 229E and HCVV 229E are found all over the world, causing mild breathing diseases.
These four families that have been transferred through society have been well adapted to humans and are generally less capable of severe diseases, even though there were some cases for unknown reasons, such as the rare case has recently been reported, the type of HCV-NL3 infection has caused the lower air system infection in China.
In general, when these HCVs have the ability to communicate and maintain themselves in humans, the vivasis or the disease decreases.
In 2012, MERS was separated from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had severe and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most confirmed cases of the virus's lab occur from the Middle East, the imports have been reported due to the recent release of close calls in Europe and Tusss.
The second outbreak was confirmed in South Korea in 2015 with 186.
It is similar to the SARS disease, which is known by the severe occupants nature.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffered severe kidney failures, among the diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30 percent of the patients had occupants such as diabetes and vomit.
By February 14, 2020, more than 200 confirmed labs were reported with a high loss of 34.4 percent, which led to MERS-CV was one of the most dangerous virus known to humans.
From mid-term December 2019 to late, patients who were diagnosed with terminal diseases related to SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan, the province of Hubi, China.
The World Health Organization announced the beginning of the infection of the substrate system, which was due to SARS-CoV-2, the public health condition of the world, and called it Coveid-19.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases around the world reached 90,053, and the percentage of the raw casualties was 3.4%.
The deaths in Hobi China were 4.2%, whereas outside was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS - CoVS and MERS - CoV, causes severe breathing infections, which are seen as fever, cough, and fatigue.
It's also seen in some patients.
It is one of the most severe symptoms, and can quickly become an extreme breathing syndrome.
Although SARS-CV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, due to 82% of the equivalence above the nucleotide sequence, it is then (in various branches) to the physic tree.
It seems that SARS-CoV-2 has less disease than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more likely to be transmitted.
Reported that some infected with SARS-CoV-2 had no symptoms that could help spread it around the world quickly.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCV shows significant differences and differences.
The first case is that the period and length of HCV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general process of six HCVs.
Secondly, the Covide-19 symptoms are the limits between SARS-CoV and four HCVVEs from society (HCV-229E, HCV-CCCCCCID, HCV-HKUV1 and HCVV-NL33).
From one side, SARS-CoV-2 shows the properties that are usually seen in HCV infections from society, including non-sympathetic, mild, or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, under a small set of severe Koveid-19 cases can also be seen about SARS-CV infection, even though its ratio is slightly lower.
Secondly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting patterns from HCVs and SARS-CoVs from society.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least the size of HCVs transferred from society.
On the other hand, it must be confirmed whether the SARS-CoV-2 transfer ability is reduced, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVV, after several times.
In the end, as with other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in poop samples.
The fact that the transfer of SARS-CV-2 plays an important role in transport, such as SARS-CV, at least in some cases, must be turned on by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2, such as HCVs transferred from society, may be seasonal.
However, SARS-CoV-2 features include transferability, disease, and permanent development after transmission from someone to another person will affect the final fate of the present prevalence-19.
All four HCVs from society that create mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
In other words, it may be true that humans have been properly adapted to these four HCVs.
In other words, both can be the survivors of all ancient HCV collections.
The HCVs that caused severe diseases in humans and the people who were infected with severe HCV diseases are now gone.
For this purpose, HCVs must be re-resolved enough in humans to allow the gathering of indentible mutations to disarm the host's restricted factors.
In this case, as the SARS-CoV-2 spread further and more people are infected with this disease, there will be more chance of fully adapting to this virus with humans.
The virus will be difficult to prevent the transfer in humans by quarantine or other infection control measures if it is properly adapted.
For many years, four CVs have been walking around in human communities and causing normal colds in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruss don't need an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted to humans and their transfer between humans cannot be stable.
They need to keep and publish in their animal continuity, and they're looking for an opportunity to treat human goals, which is probably done through one or more middle hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that have been obtained by SARS-CV or MERS-CoV and four HCVs from the same society.
This virus, such as HCVs transferred from society, has a high transfer ability at least for the present time.
However, its disease is greater than its HCVs that have been transferred than the society, and more than SARS-CV or MERS-CV.
It has to wait and see whether this virus is completely adaptable to humans and whether it is transmitted between humans without a reservation or an animal host.
Before discussing animal origins, HCoVs will be useful to examine the properties of evolution, natural, continuity, intersidious, and re-integrating HCVs.
If an animal is a shelter near a virus that has a high-intensive form on the noralotoid sequence level, it acts as an evolutionary host of HCV.
The original virus is usually adaptable in the host, and it is not for the disease.
Similarly, a tank host gives HCoV shelter for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCV has an interface or some other host at the same time, it's not quite consistent with the new host and most of the disease.
This interface host can act as an animal tank of human infection, and in the role of the simulation host, it will increase the level of infection in human beings by providing the temporary resusciprovation of the virus and then transporting it to humans.
If HCoV cannot keep its transfer in the middle host, it can cause deadly infections.
On the contrary, HCoVs can adapt to the middle host and even be present in the host group for long.
In this case, the middle host acts as a natural tank host.
Antidemiology data shows that the first person infected with SARS has been dealing with hunting animals.
The next analysis shows that the safety level of G and anti-virus virus is more common to animal products than normal people.
For the first time, a number of masked trees were discovered by Pegama Laarvata and a Racona dog in the live animal market carrying SARS-CV virus, which were almost the same with SARS-CV.
A 29-noulotide removal is found for SARS-CoV in races taken at the beginning of human epidemia.
At the same time, it has been reported that the masks of the forest or the fields that were not provided alive in the animal market were mostly negative in terms of the SARS-CV virus. This shows that the masked soil is probably just the host of the interface, not the natural tank of SARS-CV.
The remarkable point is that 80 percent of animals have anti-SARS-CV in the markets, so the probability that several species of small mammals may also be able to act as inter-serving hosts for SARS-CV.
All of this seems to be the final hosts of SARS-CV.
In the next search for the natural host of SARS-CV, a type of virus with a bat that had a lot to do with the KV3 virus, known as the HKU3 virus associated with Saros, horse bat (SARS-Rot-Bat CoVV) was found living in Chinese horse bats.
These bats are positive with anti-SARS-CoV and SARS-RH-BatCoV3 genome sequence.
This virus and other bat-carry co-Vs have 80 to 92 percent of the equivalence sequence with SARS-CV.
These studies became a field for a new theory that says the bat hosts the new virus of human disease.
A number of coronas were identified as the SL-CVS virus in the bat, but they were unable to separate any living virus except WV1.
==Presolation==The human angitin 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the SARS-CV receiver.
WER1, which was obtained from bat poop, showed that ACE2 bats, Siut and human beings were used as receivers to enter the cell.
The interesting thing is that Sarah's healed head had the ability to disarm WVI1.
By now, WV1 has been the closest parent to the bat with 95% of the nucleonide sequence.
Although there is a lot of parallel between these two types of virus, it is generally believed that the WVI1 parents are not the hosts of the SARS-CV and bats, the host of SARS-CV.
In this case, the MERS-CV is used as a group with a similar group such as the Bat CoV-HKU4 and the Bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS - CoV uses a similar host receiver called expdyl (DP4) to enter the virus.
The RNA sequences associated with the MRI-CV are more closely related to the physium of bats that have been identified from Europe and Africa.
There's never been a live MERS-CV in wild bats before.
The MERS-CV virus, and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25, is similar to that of the nanoethide sequence.
Thus the bat cannot host the MERS-CV tank.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that the camels of a mountain are positive in terms of the unique disarmor of the MERS-CoV, as well as about the Middle East camels that live in the African country.
The live MERS-CoV virus similar to the virus found in humans was sampled from the camel's nose and showed that camels are hosting the actual MERS-CV tank.
The symptoms of the virus are often seen in the camels that were physically infected with the MERS-CV.
It is noted that the infected camels spread the virus not only through the breathing device but through the excavation of the mouth, which is also the main way to remove the virus in the bat.
However, one of the questions that has remained unresolved since then is that in many cases the MERS has no history of contact with the camel before the symptoms, which is likely to be attributed to the transfer of man to the human being or to the unknown transport routes that include the species of unknown animals.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has about 96.2 percent of the sequence of nucleotide with the CVTG13 virus, separated from the bat.
Like SARS-Covs and MERS-CV, the sequence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is great to determine the relationship between parents.
In other words, the bat cannot host SARS-CoV-2's virus tank unless the bat's cavs are almost the same in the future.
In fact, animal hosts, SARS-CoV-2, where many of the early cases have been seen, they must have been sold between wild animals and killed in the Hanan food market, which represents the possible transfer of virus from animals to humans.
The recent studies based on the metagenium sequence show that a group of little mammals were exposed to risk, called Pangolina, can also be the refuge of the ancestors of the SARS-CV-2.
This new genetic virus has a CV-Pagulin virus of about 85–92% of the sequence of nucleotides with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, the virus is associated with about 9% of the sequence of nucleotide sequences the same size with RTG13.
The virus has two substrates of SARS-CoV-2 substrates in the Phillytic tree, one of which has the same domain of the connection with SARS-CV-2 and 97.4% the same sequence of amino acids.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are more different than sequences throughout the genome.
In a previous study done on the patient's Palogins, it is reported that the lung samples are separated from the DNA of a virus that might be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, different methods of finding sequence and manual correction were used to create a part of the genome sequence that formed about 86.3% of the virus's genome length.
We can't refuse the possibility that Pangolin is one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 animal interfaces.
However, there is no evidence that the source of SARS-CoV-2 exists in Pargolin, since there is a sequence between the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and the C-C-CV-C-C-CV-CV-CV-CV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and CCVs associated with SARS-CV-2.
SARS-CoV-2's evolution path is not yet found in bats, Pagulin, and other mammals.
While the largest sequence in RBDs has been seen between SARS-CoV-2 and Pagulin, the most common sequence of genome sequences have the highest species of genome sequences, SARS-CV-2 and RTG13.
It is believed to be a high degree of contrast between RBDs-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2, due to evolution with selection.
A different offer is a member of the SARS-CoV-2Pagulin and RTG13 in the third wild animal species.
In evolution, noise is common as a drive force between occupants-CoVs.
The judgment has not ended with SARS-CoV-2 animal origins.
In addition to the very disease of HCoV 229E, HCoVV-OCID, HCV-NL63 and HCVV-HKUU1 are still studying.
Phillytic evidence shows that both HCoV - NL63 and HCV-229 may have been derived from bats, while HCV-CCID and HCoV-HKU1's parents are found in the atmospheres.
It has been reported that a bat named ARCV2 (APP) found in the three colors of North America has a close relationship with HCV-N63.
On the other hand, HCV-229 E is a geneticly related to CoVE bat called Heppostreos/Gana Kwaamm/19/14, which was discovered in Nigeria, while the completeds are also suspected as the host of this virus.
To be clear, information about the animal origins of the known HCVs is in form 1 and table 2.
Phillytic analysis has provided evidence to transfer between the HCV species in history.
In 1890, when HCoV - OC43 was transferred to different species to infect human beings through my bowels, a ponmy found a breathing infection.
The history of transmission between HCV-229E is not very specific.
Alla-CoVs are found with a close connection to HCV-229E.
Among them is a Alfa-CoV Alka.
There are several evidence of direct transport of the virus by bats to humans.
First of all, not humans can communicate with bats in a common biological environment.
Instead, humans have a close connection to the Alcatas.
In addition, the alfa-Covo bats associated with HCoV 229E are diverse in bats, while Alpha-CoV al-CValakis cause an infection of breathing disease in animals.
Finally, Alfa-CoV is not found in wild animals.
Thus, it is not possible to remove the possibility that Alfa-CoVs related to HCV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of the disease virus in humans, including the Harry virus, the Abola virus, the Nipa virus, and the Indian virus.
So it's not surprising that bats directly transfer HCV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while Alfia-CoVs are acting as HCV-229E's genetic vault, Alfia and camels of a mountain may act as hosts of internets that transfer the virus to humans, just as it was seen in the case of MERS-CVV.
The MERS-CV is an excellent example of the transfer between bats to the camel of a mountain and the camel to humans.
The source of MERS-CV evolution was visible from the bat from the beginning of the virus's recognition, and the next findings strengthened the theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich tank of virus species to exchange between genetic parts and inter-resolation.
Long-life, busy colonys, close social interactions and strong ability to fly, are all the best conditions for bats that make him an ideal virus player.
On the other hand, MERS-CV has been entered into the camel of a mountain for decades.
The virus has been well adapted to these camels, and this camel has been turned from a middle host to a fixed, natural host.
The MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease, and in these animals, they have a relatively low mutation rate.
This virus is a random event to humans, and the human host is the dead end of the MERS-CV because its transport can't be stable.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CV, the role of Ploglin is different if it is involved in this case.
Especially that Pangulin-Covo is very ill in Pargolin.
These animals may be hosted to the dead end of the dead-coVVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar to the SARS-CVV.
There are several possibilities to transfer between the SARS-CoV-2 species of animals to humans that must be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, the bat can host the virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Man may be shared with bats by butchering or extracting coal.
Second of all, Pangolin could be one of the mid-insurgent inter-resisting hosts in which a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2 has recently entered.
Man is infected with this virus through butchery and meat use.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to examine domestic and wild animals.
The third is, as said above, novakbi and SARS-CoV-2 may have happened in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and palogins.
SARS-CoV-2 is still searching for animal origins.
In addition to various types of animal hosts, three other factors from the virus are important for the cVs through existing barriers.
First of all, a relatively high rate of mutation in their RNA resizing.
The amount of mutations estimated in the CV virus, with the average rate of about 10-4 replacements per website, depending on the level of coV compatibility with the new host, which can be considered "continuing" to "many".
The CoVs have an osmorbonocles of error correction that can lead to a high mutation, mire, or even failure to survive.
The interesting thing is that Remsvir Annooti's e-mail is controlled by these oscillosis and RNA's pre-explications prevent the removation of CoV.
Remsvir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 factors that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, the CV's mutation rate is about a million times more than their host.
In addition, the mutation rate is high when the CoVs are not fully adaptable to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with the high rate of mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate seems to be lower, which represents the higher level of its adaptability to human beings.
This virus is probably now adapting to another host close to humanity.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is the case for MERS-CoV, which is well adaptable to the camel of a mountain.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic change can quickly reduce vaccines and anti-viruss against SARS-CoV-2.
Second of all, the large RNA genome in CoVs causes molecular adaptability to correct the genome for genetic mutations and noises, and thus increases the probability of reciprocal change between species, which will help new CoVs emerge at the right time.
This is supported by the large amount of open-source frames and protein functions that are encrypted toward the end of 3's genome.
The third is that the CoVs, randomly and repeatedly, change the formats through the "Cip-elect" mechanism.
In the host that acts as a resounder tank, the string switch is repeatedly due to the time of the CVRNA script.
The subgenies and completely similar to the long length can be re-integrated to produce new CVs.
In both HCoV - HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and animal CoVs such as Bet-CV and BaatCoV - HKU9, the Physic evidence has been found for natural noise.
The virus interaction - the host's connection to transport
In addition to three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that affects the transition between the species.
Here, the SARS-CV noise is considered as a typical example, showing evidence of positive choice during the event of the intercellation.
According to a comparison analysis between human separate samples and SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to have a quick match in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD Protein S.
Generally, RBD interacts with the cell receiver in CV protein, causing severe anti-SBD reaction to the host.
In the SARS-CV virus, it is located in amino acid 318 to 510, and is connected to ACE2 people and shared virus input receivers.
RBD is the virus of SARS-CV, capable of detecting a variety of animals, including bats, sieves, mouse, and Racon's dog, which provides the ability to transfer a different species for the virus.
In fact, it was seen that only six amino acids were different from viral samples taken from humans and Sieves in RBD, and that four of them are connected in Motif - the receiver for the interaction with the ACE2 receiver.
SARS - CoVS has K4N and S48T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the desire to interact with the ACE2 human receiver.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements may be vital for viral compatibility with humans.
It is required that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar cell receiver with SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at S1 Protein S shows that the tendency to connect S to ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a Cryo-MI study shows that the willingness of 10 to 20 equalitys exists between the ACE2 people and the SARS-CoVS protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another common receiver is needed for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
The interesting thing is, HCV - NL63 also connects to ACE2 but with another part of S.
There are a lot of HCV receivers, such as HCV 229E for HCVV-229E, and 9-O-E-E-E-E-Systylated cycid for HCoV-E43.
These receivers may also explain the successful compatibility of these CoVs in humans after moving between species of animal hosts.
In addition to cell receivers, the result of the transfer between the HCV species is also controlled by other factors associated with the host and the limiting.
The host's proteins between humans and natural hosts such as bats, individual camel, and atmospheres may cause a barrier to the inter-formation of species.
For a successful transfer between a successful species, HCoV must be controlled by the host-related factors and destroy the host's restricted factors.
In this case, molecular factors must be identified and identified in this important context by virus-symbal interaction.
SARS-CoV-2 may be a product of SARS-CV-2 with advanced CISPR technology.
New HCV's Genesis: From the beginning
The variety of bats has provided many opportunities for the rise of new HCVs.
In this case, bats are treated as the HCV gene tank.
In addition, quick and genetic mutations also promote HCV evolution and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, finding or losing new genes is the potential for severe changes in virus technology.
Among the SARS-CV side proteins, it is thought that the OTF8 protein has a significant role in adapting to humans, since after the separation of the bat virus associated with SARS-CV, it turns out that this virus is coding different ORF8 proteins.
===SARS-CoV virus===The removal property of the occupants is seen at the beginning of the human epidemation.
This delete divides the OF8 into the EEF8 and the OFF8b, and is thought to be a matching mutation that helps change the host.
In addition to this, SARS-CoV has a possible new history with the ancestors of Alpha and Gamma, where many smaller circuits were identified in RNA's polymorphosis depending on RNA.
Rescalby sites were identified in nsp9, the top part of nsp10 and parts of nsp14 were identified.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CV virus has experienced all of the events between different ancestors that occurred in one of the two mountains in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS - CoV and MERS-CoV, the resective event is also seen in other HCVs, where HCVs are combined with other animals in their non-informed genes.
It also has to be warned that artificial selection can help unresolve changes in the virus genome, which is likely due to the release of the virus from chosen pressure, such as the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is loss of the EORF4 with full length in the original generation HCV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
However, the HCV-229 E bats and camels can be seen in full-handed and complete HCF4 virus, AFFF4 will cause the frame to change with a single extra nucleotide.
The final point, of course, is that new HCV evolution is also directed by choice pressure in their tank hosts.
The lack of symptoms or mild symptoms were diagnosed when bats were infected with the CoVs, which represents the reciprocal harmony between the CoV and the bats.
The bats seem to have been properly adapted to the CoVs.
For example, the disorder inencision of a precipitation reaction in bats will effectively reduce the damage caused by the CoVs.
In addition, natural killer's cell activity in bats is also suppressed due to the re-integration of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of tissue integration of large complex molecules in the I class.
In addition, a high level of erosion oxygen species (ROS), which is due to the activity of the bats, can both suppress and affect the disservation of the CV, thus providing a choice to produce very much virus disease races at the time that enter a new host.
CoV races that are mostly disease may lead to a new protein or protein properties for host compatibility.
So, it's not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not a disease, or they create rare symptoms in tank hosts such as bats and camels.
The virus is highly re-resolved without having a strong response to the host's security response.
Here's a mystery why pregnant people are seen without symptoms and what causes severe conditions in human disease.
The severe symptoms are primarily due to severe immune system activity and the Cytokin storm, where the more powerful immune system is, the greater damage to lung damage.
In contrast, in non-signed patients, the immune response is separate from the CV disintegration.
The separate strategy of the immune system's response may have useful effects in treatment with the anti-SARS-CoV-2.
Interferon responses in bats are particularly strong.
Thus, the I type Interferon management should at least be useful in humans at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the NLRP3 activates the NLRP3 in bats.
With this argument, the control of the NLRP3 system may be useful with MC950.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to follow the general context of the SARS-CoV event and MERS-CoVV.
While the sARS-CV has a bat with a SARS-CoV, it has 95% nucleotide equivalent, but there is also a continuity of a bat that has 96% nucleotide equivalents with SARS-CoV-2.
As it turns out, the Syots and other animals were virus shelters such as SARS-CoV, but the host of SARS-CoV-2's host was not yet identified.
;SARS-CoV-2, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has been found and shows that the Pagulins may act as one of the interface hosts, or that the C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-S-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-V-A-A-CV-2 can help with gene pieces in the final version of SARS-CVV-2.
There is still no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is built by humans on purpose or random, although there are questions on this subject.
The CVs have returned to the attention center due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of the KVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the importance of human origin and animal destruction.
A comprehensive evidence has shown that the source of MERS-CV, SARS-CV and SARS-CoV-2 are bats and are transferred to humans through interface hosts.
As the SARS-CV infections of contact between humans and Siots in the markets, the sea market closes and killing the Syots were able to effectively end Sarus' disease.
With the same argument, the Pagulins must be removed from the sea animal market to prevent animal transfers to humans, which is why it is discovered by several ancestors of Al-Co-CoVininins, which have a close connection to SARS-CVV-2.
However, how SARS-CoV-2 transfers from Paloglin and other mammals still need further research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CV has long existed in the camels of a mountain.
These camels are considered an important tool to carry and also the main source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local people.
These camels are widely spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animals market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent the periodic spread of MERS, a comprehensive method must be taken to produce effective vaccines against the MERS-CV for camels with other standards of control of pollution.
Because we're not able to remove these viruss, so there may be new biology coming up and causing the spread of disease.
There are many common types of human beings and animals traveling in the wild.
In particular, bats are very diverse with the potential to transfer from animal to human beings.
There are many opportunities for these common KVs to grow between humans and animals to be re-integrated and to lead to the rise of new CVs, which can be high and deadly.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China must be put aside to reduce the unnecessary connection between humans and animals.
With the hard test SARS, MERS and Coved-19 for us, we must have a better plan to prepare and respond.
In fact, many viruss have been on this planet for a long time.
They're like in their natural waste until there's an opportunity to collapse.
Although bats have many features that help spread the virus, if people are trained to avoid them, the probability of contact with bats and other animal species can be at least at least.
The constant surveillance of mammals is necessary to understand the best of their estimology and natural hosts, and it will be useful to prevent the animal's nest to humans and its spread.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent the common virus between humans and animals is to keep humans away from the natural biochemistry of the common virus between humans and animals.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 animal puzzle have not been found yet.
First of all, if the bat has transferred an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to Pangolin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the bat and Pagulin were able to share in a common eological situation.
Second of all, if the bat plays a direct role in human transport, how humans make contact with bats.
Third of all, if a third mammal has acted as a host of real interfaces, how does it interact with different species, including human, bat, and Pagulin.
And finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be allergic to SARS-CoV-2, both care and experience housing should be performed.
The animal is expected to be identified by bats, palgolin, or any other mammals, as the SARS-CoV-2 or her parents' virus that are almost the same in their natural hosts in the future.
The ongoing research in this field will turn on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have important effects in preventing Kovaid-19 in humans.
You need to update Coveid-19's recognition standards about suspicious Mead and the approved Mead.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide to identify and treat the Cronoa virus (2019-nCovoV), a guide to our experience, and a good reference to fighting this disease around the world.
However, the chroma virus of the 2019s is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are gradually increasing based on research findings of development and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment are constantly updated.
In this article, we presented a view of our instructions, and we provided the latest standard of suspicion and "confirmed" based on the latest diagnosis and treatment for the Koved-19 (which was issued by the National Republic of China).
In December 2019, the new Cronoa virus (2019–NCoV) caused the spread of the disease, which is now officially named after the chrome virus 2019 (coid-19), also known as the E.R.S.-C.V.R.-2.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization introduced Koved-19 as a Podmi.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 disease, our team developed a quick guide and published it online in military medical research magazine on February 1, 2020.
This guide has taken a lot of attention since the release.
Note that Koved-19 is a new disease, that our knowledge gradually increases based on research findings progressing and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosiss and treatment are constantly updated.
For example, the diagnosis and treatment instructions for Koved-19 were published by the National Health Committee of China (http, wwww.nc.gc.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, where some verses have been changed.
Now Zhou and his colleagues have given a view of our guide, which includes a simple privilege offer based on their clinical experience.
Their article added new evidence to our guidance and also presented a valuable reference to this Pondmi around the world.
We declare their outstanding work and our appreciation.
However, their article must be updated according to the latest diagnosis and treatment instructions for the Koveid-19 (7x7) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), one of the features of all disease history should be combined with two of the obvious signs to present a comprehensive analysis, or if there is no history of all diseases, it should take three cases of clinical symptoms:
The history of all integration: (1) The history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities reported in the case of Kovaid-19 days before the symptoms; (2) The history of contact with patients with SARS-CoVV-2 (3) is positive (3) with fever or breathing disease from the city and areas around it, or other communities reported during 14 days before the symptoms (4 days of C.C.E.L.D.), or other communities reported contact with the C.E.D.
Its signs are:(1) or breathing symptoms; 2(2) images taken from CO2-19 infection; (3) The total number of white blood cells that indicate the increase in ordinary number is reduced at the initial stage of the disease.
The diagnosis must be based on suspicious cases with one of the following: 1 PCR's insurgency (1) to detect SARS-CoV-2; 2) The entire genome of the virus that shows a high hemorphism with the new chromat virus (3) is positive in terms of an IgM and anti-CVG test; or the change of an IGS-CVIG test, or an IGS-CV-CV-D-2, or an IGFFFF-DFFFFFFFF, or an increase in negative state of positive or more than negative levels of positive stages.
We can see that PCR's quick-symmble testing has been added in terms of nucleic acid in the breathing system or blood samples to the second edit (18 January 2020) and third (2 January 2020).
It was added to the 4th edition of January 2020 (8 January 2020), and the fifth (8 February 2020) was added to the seventh edit.
These changes have been made based on the continuous work of researchers who have been looking for an optimization of an optimal acid kit for quick recognition, and also based on a sample of the breathing device, including blood biopsy, which has caused further access to various samples and has supported the positive anti-frequency in approved standards.
In addition, there are more evidence that we're warned to deal with unusual symptoms and patients who lack symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou and the colleagues' graph should be updated, because in this flumart is a person who has no clinical symptoms as "Syske Cam".
The score system must also be confirmed in action and with more clinical studies.
To collect, we hope that more direct evidence will come up and ask readers to present their opinions.
In order to identify the suspicious Mead and the approved Mead, we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest instructions of their countries.
Our team will also regularly update guide for help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to Koved-19, the highest daily statistics.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to Koved-19 on this day.
It has been the highest number of daily casualties due to this virus.
Yesterday, the IEDCR Institute reported that the records include active and 33 recovered cases that rest at home.
There are 17 deaths in total.
Dr. Myrjayy Sabraa, the director of the IEDCR news meeting online, said that in these statistics the number of casualties, four men, and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 50 and 60 and one case between 41 and 50.
He also added that there were two victims from Daka.
On March 11th, the World Health Organization announced Podmi Koveid-19.
One of the hospital's staff told the local news agency that one of the deceased, the Most Gracious, was one of the directors of the Bangal War Committee who was under surveillance at Kwait Matrere Hospital.
Saturday, Obadol Quider, the minister of road transport and Bangladesh's bridges online announced that public transport would be closed until next Saturday, more than it was planned at the beginning.
The public transport was first started on March 26, and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4th.
They carry basic goods -- medical goods, fuels and foods -- continued.
The first case of Koveid-19 was registered in Bangladesh on March 8, two passengers who had returned from Italy and was also one of them.
On March 19, these three recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected over a million people around the world.
The data at Johns Hokins University shows that on Thursday, the total of cases related to CARS-CoV-2 has gone further than a million cases worldwide.
At least 25,000 deaths are attributed to Coved-19, the disease created by Cronos.
The first case of the virus was confirmed by the Corona virus in Malavi and the first death of the Corona virus in Zahana, this day became a point of displacement.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed that the country was one of the few countries that was not infected by the Corona virus.

In the U.S., over 244 thousand virus diseases have been registered to Crona, leading to at least 5.00 deaths.
The CBS NEEWS reported that on Wednesday more than 10,000 deaths were recorded in the United States due to the disease of Corona's virus.
Different countries around the world have made more difficult measures to prevent the spread of this disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the city's holiday to 1 on Thursday.
The President of Veldeir Puttin announced that the Russian people's rights and wages will be paid until April 30, without need of them to go to work.

The Governor of Ohio announced that this state extended house quarantine laws to 1.
Australia's shops reduced the purchase of toilet paper every time.
The Wallworth and Colls in Australia, on Saturday and Sunday evening, reduced the limit to buying toilet paper in every store in the country, in two and a package for every purchase.
The Al-Nian store also announced the limit of buying a package on Monday.
These restrictions are declared as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of these chain stores.
According to reports, the buyer is afraid of the need for personal quarantine due to the Kovaid-19 spread.
On Wednesday also, Weulverts limited buying toilet paper for home delivery to a package for each order.
These changes were applied to the limit of four packages for each purchase, which was announced in the history of 4 and 5 March by Wellworth and Colls.
In his 8 March press statement, Colls announced that despite the limit of buying four packages, "many stores end in an hour" and read this demand rate, "Decisive," the Al-Kals store also described it on their Facebook page, "unjust" on Tuesday.
According to Wellworth, he experienced the sales rate last week as a "great increase".
The Cestco store in Canber also limited the amount of purchases allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce this lack, Colls has ordered the producers with bigger packages and has increased the supply of goods to the stores, and has made it more available.
Rassol Zamerman, the director of the Australia Resmerman Society, announced that the subsidacy of the South Australia community is trying to increase its existence, but local council restrictions have made it difficult for the supply trucks to schedule the supply trucks.
He said he expected the production costs to increase because the providers are trying to respond to the demand and the special sales are reduced.
On Tuesday, the LALD store announced that some stores would not be able to be sold on Wednesday due to their early supply.
Dr. Gary Morttier, an expert at the University of Queensland, reported in a news report in News.com.au, said that stores fill their store every night.
He added that toilet paper is the property of stores in terms of low numbers, and when this product is finished, it makes a lot of space in the lockers and puts the sense of lack.
In the ABC News, Rassel Zamerman said that if there are so many products in the shelf, there are such products as toilet paper and anti-intensives in the top number and they could be bought, your fear would probably be at least.
The WWGS A CAP, the producer of last Wednesday's recycled toilet paper, announced that their existence was over.
According to News.com.au, Kmberley-Clark, which generates Kleenex toilet paper and Solais Power, which makes the toilet paper, is based on the NewS.com.
The Dmain.com, a active website reported that when the buyer was given less auctions due to a long weekend holiday, some real estate sellers offered free toilets to the first auctioners in Allah's field in deeds.
On Thursday's Thursday Newes, one of the Darwin newspapers, had an eight letter special to take off and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report on March 3, these stores did not necessarily want to be limited and announced that they had no plans to do any limit to buy.
It has added that there is a lot of demand for other goods, including masks, anti-intensives, dry goods, liquids and soap and flour.
Out of Australia as well, the English online supermarket Ocado witnessed the limit of buying the toilet paper at two packages of 12 Roley.
The World Health Organization announced Koveid 19th.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the prevalence of Coved-19 – created by CoronaS-CoV-2 virus.
Although the word "pandmi" refers only to the spread of a disease, not the risk rate, the WHO stressed the need to move governments into counterstances:
All countries can still change the length of this pie.
The WHO manager Tados Adhanum Gheberyius said that if the countries were identified, tested, treated, quarantined, and tracked, they would be prepared.
We're deeply concerned, both from the warning level of the disease and the violence of it, and from the level of warning, there's no appropriate action.
According to Dr. Tom Friedden, former head of the United States Control and Control Centers, this is "unknown".
In the statement published in February by CNN, he said: "No other breathing virus has been traced from Genesis to global outbreak, except for flu.
Gheberys also said in the same statement: "We've never seen Pandmi before, created by a virus by a Crona."
He went on, "And we've never seen Pondmi be controlled before."
The new situation was declared to be internationally concerned after the WHO decision in January.
Dr. Anthony Foci, the head of the National Institute of Allergism and the U.S. disease, said about the spread of this disease: "The front line situation is getting worse."
By Thursday, there were at least 137 people around the world who led to more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandmi Crona virus (SARS-2019) is an advanced psmium of Corona virus 2019 (coid-19) caused by an acute breathing syndrome of the virus 2 (SARS-CV-2).
In December 2019, China was identified as a public health emergency, and on January 30, 2020, it became known as Pandmi on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of Koveid-19 were reported in 127 countries and territory, leading to some 97,000 deaths.
It's about 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China has been estimated about 4%, while the global level of 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.4% have been variable in 1.4%.
Most common symptoms include fever, cough and breath.
Its effects may include the nature of acknowledgence and a severe breath syndrome.
The time distance from the virus's entry into the body to start symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be variable between two and 14 days.
There are no known vaccines or treatments for it.
The initial treatment is the treatment of symptoms and support treatments that are recommended include washing hands, mouthing while coughing, distanceing from other people and personal quarantines for people who are suspicious of getting infected.
The authorities of various countries around the world have responded to this virus by applying the limits of travel, quarantine, military government, risk control at work and shutting down different places.
It has led to severe economic and social disorder, delay, or cancel sports events, religious, political, and cultural and broader resources, which can be re-integrated by buying anger.
Schools and universities have been shut down in 193 countries or in a national level, which has affected 99.4 percent of the world’s students and students.
The false information on the virus has been developed online and has developed some of the horrors and discrimination against the people of China and other people who have races and appearances of East and South Asia, and others from the vast region of the virus.
Because of the limitations of the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon release levels have been reduced.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China, reported a group of cases in the province of Hobi for unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and began research in early January 2020.
These cases were mostly connected to the main market of the food market, and therefore it is thought that the virus has an animal source.
The virus that caused this disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has been discovered recently and has a close connection to the bat virus, Cromona, the Pangolin virus, and SARS-CoVV. It turns out that the first known person was sick on December 1, 1919, and this person had no visible connection to the next group of sea food.
It turns out that two-thirds of the early cases reported in December 2019 had a connection to this market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the "Suluth China Maring" newspaper claimed that a case was traced on November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hobi province who could be first infected. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that there had been a sudden increase of cases in China, Italy, and South Korea for the first time outside of China's new number of new cases in China.
The number of cases may be reported in a significant amount of less than reality, especially among those with a milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, and less than 19 years old and less only 2.4 percent of the cases around the world were created.
This means that the number of people who have been tested for Coved-19 and that their testing has been positive based on formal protocols.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have made official policy that they will not be tested by individuals who have only very few symptoms.
The research published on March 16, showed that by 23 January, about 86% of the cases were not identified by Koved-19, and these cases were not registered, the source of 77% of the cases had been registered.
A statistical analysis published on March 30, estimated that the number of cases in Italy has been reported in a significant amount of cases.
The initial estimates of the base number (R0) were for Coved-19 between 1.4 to 2.4.
The research published by the U.S. Control Center concluded that this number could be 5.7.
Most people with CO2-19 recover.
For those of you who don't recover, the beginning of symptoms between 6 and 41 days has been the most common period of 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, almost 97000 deaths have been attributed to Coved-19.
In China, by 5 February, 80% of the deaths have been in people over 60 years, and 70 percent of them have had ground diseases, including heart disease and diabetes.
The real number of deaths and deaths caused by the Coved-19s can be much more, because it may not include people who died without testing, for example, at home, at nursing centers and so forth.
The lack of information from Italy showed that the number of victims without testing during this fall was about 5-4 times more than the official death rate of the Verre Coveid.
The speaker of the U.S. Control Centers (CDC) said, "We know that death is less than real, it matches the reports of less statistics in the United States.
The first case of death occurred outside China's main land on February 1, in the Philippines and the first case of death outside Asia on February 14, France.
By February 28, it was recorded outside China's main land, over tens of deaths in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, over 40 countries and government territory were reported in all continents except the South Pole of Death.
These numbers are changed by region and over time, and from the amount of tests, the quality of the system, the health options, the time passed from the early process and population properties such as age, gender, and general health conditions, death rate can be obtained by sharing the number of deaths on all cases known in a period of time.
According to Johns Hokins University statistics, the global death rate is by 10 April 2020, equal to 6.0% (97,039/1,617, 204).
This number is different in each area.
In China, the estimate of death rate from 17.3% (for those whose symptoms began from 10 January 2020) was reduced to 0.7% (for those whose symptoms began after February 1, 2020) containing the rate of casualties (CFR) that show the percentage of people who die from a disease (R) and the rate of diseases that are not diagnosed with a disease (IR) and the rate of people who die in a disease.
These statistics do not have a time limit, and a specific population follows the case to solve it.
A number of universities have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Medical Center estimates that the rate of casualties of the disease is generally between 0.1.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range corresponds to the results received from the first random CFR test in Germany, as well as the statistical study that analyzes the effect of the CFR estimate.
WHO emphasizes that it is controlled.
In the case of the last one and the last period of the process, it cannot be absolutely considered and may be different based on the location.
Macij Boni from the State University of Pean stated: "The common insurgent disease can usually be stable if there is no action to control them, and when the disease is removed from available hosts, they begin to reduce.
But right now, it's impossible to provide any reasonable predictions about when this will happen.
Zhong Nhanhan, the senior medical adviser of the Chinese government, argued that if all countries were to gather to do the advice of the World Health Organization in the field of counter-intensive measures for the spread of this virus, "This disease can end until June.
Adam Kuchsaki of the London Health and Health School of Health and Health on March 17th, announced that SARS-CoV-2 would probably be traveling for a year or two.
According to research, it is necessary to lead Neel Freguson at Royal College, physical distance and other actions, as long as a vaccine is created (or perhaps 18 months or longer).
Wiliam Schafner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think the possibility of this virus completely disappeared -- because it's easily transferred," and "it may become a seasonal disease that comes back every year."
It depends on mass immunity and mutation.
Coved-19's symptoms can be relatively unique, and people with infected may be without symptoms.
Two of the most common causes are fever (8%) and dry cough (68%).
The symptoms that are less advanced include fatigue, breast production, loss of smell, pain, muscle pain, pain, pain, headache, depression, blood, diabetes and fluids. The World Health Organization has announced that some of six people are going to get seriously ill and have a problem breathing.
The U.S. disease and control center of the United States has published an emergency list: the problem with breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest, sudden stress, the problem with waking up, the face, the lips; if these symptoms occur, it's recommended to be treated immediately.
Some people may have no symptoms, but the test results confirm their illness, so researchers have recommended that people close to people should be careful and tested to prevent their pollution.
The resulting results by China have been made from the rate of people who lack very low values to 44% variable.
The normal period of deformation (the time between a person's illness and a person's appearance) is from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days. For example of lack of confidence, statistics were part of the people with the COW-19 who lost their sense of smell, at the beginning of 30 percent, but later it was down to 15.
Some details about how this disease has spread, are still being identified.
It is thought to be thought that this disease is mostly due to a close connection and by small particles produced by coughing, or talking, and that the relationship is close to a distance between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that coughing without cover can spread small particles between 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 82 meters (27 feet).
Some research has come up with the fact that this virus can also be transmitted by small particles that are produced by talking and stay in the air for longer.
These tiny particles can land in the mouth or nose of the neighbors, or they can be moved into their lungs through breathing.
Some medical activity, such as breathing pipe and lung resuscision (CPR), can result in a spraying of the air and resulting in the spread of the disease.
It is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of transmission from the disease through the filth, it is thought that this risk is low.
China's government rejected the possibility of cereas-Cov-2 transmission, although it is possible to transfer the disease before the symptoms and the next stages of disease, the virus is most likely to be revealed in the first three days.
People whose test results have been positive for this disease until three days before the symptoms appear show that disease transfer is possible before significant symptoms occur.
There are a few reports of cases that have been confirmed by the lab, but the transfer of no signs during communications research has been identified by some countries.
The European Control Center (EDC) announced that even though the quick process of this disease is not fully known, usually a person with two or three other people can be infected.
In particular, it turns out that the virus will live on copper for three days on plastic levels and anti-stelled steel for 304, until one day on the screen and at least four hours on the copper.
However, these values can be changed depending on continuity and temperature.
There's no evidence that animals can transfer the virus to humans, but the British authorities suggest that people after contacting animals, like they have contact with other levels that people may have touched.
==SARS-Cov-2==SARS-CV-2 is a new virus that was first identified with three people who were in contact with a group of severe breathing diseases in Wuhan.
All of the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, in Corona, are associated virus in nature. Outside of human bodies, this virus is killed by home soap that takes care of it.
This virus is thought to have an animal source.
The genetic analysis has shown that the virus is geneticly viral from the species of the virus, substrated by sarbko virus (B) along with two genes of the bat.
The virus has a total level of 96 to the rest of Crona's samples of the bat virus (BatCov RTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one aminos in certain parts of their genome sequence.
The comparison of the entire genome to this day has come to the conclusion that at the maximum of 92% of the genetic material between the Pangolin virus and SARS-CoV-2, it is not enough to prove that the Pagnolins are the host of the interface.
The infection by the virus can temporarily be detected through symptoms, but the final confirmation is done through a re-information chain reaction (RRR-CR) or CT image.
A research that compares PCR to CT in Wuhan suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR and is less exclusive, as many of the features of CT's visualization are also covered with other lung diseases and disease processes.
Since March 2020, U.S. Radical College recommended that "CT should not be used as an oscillation or an initial test to detect CO2-19."
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 that were first published on 17 January.
This experiment uses a re-interpretation chain reaction (RRR-CR) for a moment.
This experiment can be performed on breathing and blood samples.
The results are usually specified between hours and days.
It's usually done with a soft-smalled throat soap, but also, it can be used. Some labs and firms are working on serological experiments that detect anti-fys.
Until April 6, 2020, none of these methods have been accurate enough to be confirmed for extensive use.
In the United States, a topological experiment invented by Celex for emergency use has only been confirmed by some valid labs.
The specific features of images in radioography (CT) and computer programming (CT) include the Grand Glus views around the name-sittent and non-interference.
The Italian Radiology Association is gathering an international database of the findings of confirmed cases.
The image without confirmation by PCR, due to other infections such as Adnous, is not uniquely used to identify Coved-19.
A major research in China compared the results of the chest to the PCR and showed that although less images can be used specifically to detect this disease, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested that it be used as an oscillation tool in all areas.
The neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to identify the properties of this virus both by radiologism and by CT.
Some methods for preventing the transmission are personal health care, washing hands, not touching eyes, noses or mouth sitting down and taking napkins during coughing or coughing and throwing the napkin directly into the trash can.
It is recommended to those who are already infected with this disease to wear surgery in public environments.
It is also recommended to maintain physical distances to prevent the transfer of this disease. Many governments have forbidden non-requisite travel to countries or areas where this disease is common.
However, in many parts of the world, this virus has reached the level of population.
This means that this virus is developing within communities, and some people don't know where they're from or how they're infected. It's recommended that people who offer standard precautions, standard precautions, take care of contact measures and use vision.
The use of mobile phone location information by governments has caused concerns about privacy, and the international pardon organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
There are different programs for mobile phones or suggestions to be used voluntarily, and until April 7, 2020, over tens of experts are trying to solve solutions that are not private, such as using Bluetooth to register the user's approach to other mobile phones.
Then users get a message if they're in contact with a person who's been infected with CO2-19.
Although many organizations are trying to make vaccines, there is still no vaccine for CO2-19.
To prevent disease from spreading, handwashing is recommended.
CDC advises people to wash their hands repeatedly with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or when the hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after the nose, cough or cough.
This is because this virus is killed outside the human body with home soap, which takes away the shield bubble.
CDC also recommends that if water and soap are not easily available, alcohol-based anti-stimulators are used with at least 60% of alcohol volumes.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, noses and mouth with their sitting hands.
This is possible in various ways (one minute exposure to anti-stressing materials for a bell surface), including 0.1% Ethanol, 100–50% expupponol, 0.1% symmm, 0.5% high hydrogen hydrogen and 7.5% bit.
Other methods, such as cylinides, are less effective and less effective.
CDC advises that if there is a suspect or confirmed document in a building such as the office of work or the day care center, all parts such as offices, health services, shared areas, common electronic devices such as tablet, touch pages, keyboard control, remote control, and self-resolved devices that have been used by patients.
Health services have recommended that people wear their own mouth and noses with their elbow or napkins and throw away the napkin immediately.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgery masks are recommended because wearing masks can reduce the volume and the distance of particles that are scattered when they talk or cough.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on time and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Giffin, the virusologist at Leeds University, "The mask can reduce the desire of people to touch their faces that are one of the most important sources if they don't follow the best health of the hand."
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks by healthy people who are in great danger, such as those who care for CO2-19, but they also confirm that wearing masks helps to prevent people from losing their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage society to wear masks.
In the United States, CDC recommends that non-medical masks made of cloth be used.
Hong Kong recommends that the surgical mask be used when using public transport or stop in crowded places.
Thai health authorities urge people to make masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Osloaki have banned people outside of society without wearing masks or mouth and noses.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to mask when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The government of Australia has forced the mask to be made for those who visit food stores.
Israel has asked all its inhabitants to wear masks when they are present.
In the middle of March, one of the ten million masks has been producing every day, traveling passengers have forced the city and buss to wear masks from April 1.
It has forced the mask to go out and has advised those who can't buy masks to make home masks themselves.
The masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes the measures of control of pollution, which can be performed by slowing the spread of the disease by minimuming close communication between individuals.
They include quarantines; travel restrictions; school closes and workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People staying at home, limiting travel, preventing presence in busy areas, greeting and greeting can be performed without physical contact or distance from others.
Now, many governments in areas where this disease is spread have forced social distance or recommended it.
The maximum number of people recommended by government institutions and health organizations in the United States was quickly reduced to 50 people (if there is no prevalence in the region) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people, older people and those with earthly diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, breathing disease, blood pressure, and immune system damage, and CDC advised people to stay at home as far as possible in areas where this disease has spread in society.
Instead of encouraging people to maintain communication using alternative methods, the concept that people should enter full social separation. Some authorities issued instructions about sexual health, for use during this period.
These instructions included advice on having sex with the person you live with, the person who's not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with CO2-19 and who are suspicious of infected, a person's term is recommended at home.
Health agencies have specified minor instructions for the correct personal quarantine. Many governments have forced or recommended personal quarantines for everyone who lives in the hostile areas of this virus.
The most severe instructions of personal quarantine have been issued to those who are in dangerous groups.
It is recommended to those who may have been in contact with the people who have recently traveled to a country or region where this disease has spread widely, since the last connection, to observe personal quarantine for 14 days.
In some cases, it is not possible for the disease to be treated as a result of the disease.
The control is performed in early stages of spread, with the aim to track and separate infected people, as well as the introduction of other measures to control the disease and to stop the spread of disease to the rest of the population.
When the control of the spread of disease is no longer possible, the efforts to reduce the strategy are made to reduce the flow rate and reduce its effect on the health system and society.
It can be performed at the same time.
In order to reverse Pandmi's base number of substrates requires less than 1. Part of the process management of an intensive disease is an attempt to reduce a single pick that is known as the smoothing of the curve.
This reduces the risk of getting too much pressure on health services and provides more time to produce and develop vaccines and treatments.
The non-medical content that can help manage the spread of this disease is personal personal measures, including hand health care, masking, personal quarantine; social activities with the purpose of physically shutting down schools and canceling events in many people; social partnerships to accept and observe these internalities; as it turns out, the greater measures were carried out by the goal of the spread of the disease in China, including the purpose of quarantineing the entire cities and the in the field.
Other countries also run a set of actions with the purpose of limiting the spread of this virus.
South Korea ran a group and local quarantine and issued warnings about the transport of infected people.
Singapore took financial support for people who quarantined themselves and placed heavy fines for those who didn't do it.
It increased the mask's production and punished for medical care. The simulations for the British and the United States show that the strategy to reduce the spread and not stop it (and suppression) are facing major challenges.
An optimization policy can reduce the request to 2/3 and the rate of death to half, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of people's deaths and causing extreme pressure to the health system.
Respiration can be a better strategy, but as long as the virus is in the human population (or until it's given a vaccine), it has to be preserved, because if the action is released, the rate of your home will return quickly.
The long-term intervention to suppress this pasmium causes social and economic costs.
There are no confirmed anti-virus drugs for Koveid-19, of course there are attempts to build it, including the test available.
Using medications without the need for a cold version, drinking fluids and rest can help reduce symptoms.
In addition to a severe amount of oxygen, you may need oxygen therapy, liquid injections, and breathing aid devices.
The use of steroids can make things worse.
Several of the compounds that have already been confirmed to treat other viral diseases are being examined to be used if it is useful to treat CO2-19.
The World Health Organization has also announced "a few traditional and home medicines" that can help ease the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization described the increased capacity and integration of the health system with the needs of Kwaid-19 patients as one of the fundamental measures to deal with the spread of the disease.
ECDC and the European World Health Organization's Office have provided instructions for hospitals and basic health care services to transfer resources to different levels, including lab services focused on the Koved-19 test, cancel unnecessary surgery if possible, separateing patients with COD-19 and increasing special capacity by training personnel and increasing number of available servants and beds.
There are different ideas about where the source of the first case (the patient "0") has been.
The first case of Corona's new virus may be returned to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hobi, China.
During a month, the number of cases with the corona virus slowly increased in Hobi.
Most of these people were associated with the major food market of the Huna sea market that was also selling living animals, and one thought is that the origin of this virus was a kind of animal virus; in other words, this virus had an animal origin.
On December 30th, a group of doctors at the Wahan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a virus similar to Sars.
The police advised eight of these doctors, including Lee Vaning, to avoid spreading false rumors, and another doctor named Aie Fne, was punished by his superiors for offering this warning.
Later, the city's health committee announced a public announcement on December 31, and informed the World Health Organization.
A lot of cases were reported by the unknown reason of the health authorities, and it started to start researching in early January. At the first stages of the spread, there were about seven and a half days, twice.
In early January 2020, the virus was transferred to other provinces of China by the help of New Year's New Year's travel, and given that Wuhan is one of the most important transport compasss and the main trade centers of China.
On January 20, 2020, China reported about 150 new cases, including one person in Beijing and one person in Shengen over a day.
The next official data shows that six, 174 people had signs until January 20, 2020.

Because of the bans of travel, public holidays, including travel attractions and the advice of governments to avoid any travel around the world, are one of the most damaged parts of the world.
As a result, many airlines, including Bretish Aires, China Easter Arlines and Qantas, have canceled their flight flight due to a decline of demand, and the Flybe Airline was shut down in England.
The virus's negative effects on Cruz's ships have been inexplicable.
Several train stations and ports were shut down.
All of this take, with Chenyun, which is one of the major seasons of travel associated with Chinese New Year's holidays.
A number of events, including the New Year's Festivals, were canceled by national or regional governments, and private companies, including Dasyland Hong Kong and Dasyland, were automatically shut down their stores and attractions.
Many of the events and attractions of New Year's New Year's Year's Eve, including the forbidden city in Beijing and the traditional temple fairs, were closed to prevent mass gathering.
In 24 cases, from 31 provinces, the city and the region of China, the New Year's officials extended the holidays to 10 February and ordered most of the workplaces not to open that date.
These areas formed 80% of the domestic production and 90% exporting of the country.
Hong Kong increased the level of anti-regency and announced an emergency situation, closed schools to March and canceled New Year's celebrations.
It was reduced to 40% by the time it was sold in Europe and Latin America.
North America and the Middle East market stores saw 60–50% of your clients drop.
The spread of the disease also led to 43–33% increase in traffic to shopping centers in March due to February.
The employees of large shopping centers around the world have done other things, including the increase of health, installing temperature scanners to check the body temperature and cancel events. According to the U.N. economic committee estimates for Latin America, the fall can cause severe poverty between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America, without this.
In January and February 2020, at the height of this fall in Wuhan, about five million people in China lost their jobs.
A lot of the population of about 300 million rural workers were caught in their home or in Hobi provinces. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the federal bank reservations of St. Louis, the spread of the virus can damage 47 million jobs in the United States and increase unemployment rate to 32% in India. In India, the unemployment of tens of tens of Indian workers (a dayly wages) showed that 44% Canadian families had experienced some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, four million French workers have applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and a million British workers have applied for a comprehensive security plan.
A short-term job plan was also performed by France and Britain.
The art and cultural heritage have also been deeply damaged from this period, both the operation and the human force of the relevant organizations -- whether working or independent -- around the world.
The active organizations in the field of culture and art have tried to continue their mission (which is often provided with government budget) in order to secure society’s access to their cultural heritage, to maintain their employees’ safety and support for artists if possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed for unknown time, and their shows, events, and shows were cancelled or delayed.
Instead, there was a lot of effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. One of the other factors of this disease that is currently in haste, is to cancel religious events, sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion fairs.
The film industry has also experienced problems. The Vatican announced that the sacred week ritual in Rome, which is held during the last week of fasting and repentance of Christianity.
Many bishops have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending the Sunday ritual; some churches have made church services available through radio, live broadcast, or television, and others have provided opportunities to be in the religion of the Air Buddy.
The Catholic bishop of Rome has shut down his churches and temples, and St. Peter's field has been empty from Christian residents, and other religious institutions have also canceled their services and have limited public meetings in churches, churches, churches, churches, and temples.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced a cancel of the Friday Prayers in various parts of the disease, and the temples were closed later, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign refugees and its inhabitants to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
It has caused the most disorder in the sports calendar around the world since World War II.
Most of the major sports events, including the European League 20-2019, the top 2020, Euro 2020, the NBA 20-20 and the NHL 2019 season, have been canceled or canceled.
The outbreak of this disease caused the 2020 Summer Olympics program that was supposed to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24, that this event would be scheduled for a date far away from 2020, at most for the summer of 2021.
This has caused many gambling companies to bring online, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their registrations. The entertainment industry has also been damaged, and many groups have suspended their concert tours.
Many large theatres, including Bredway, have suspended all shows.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce and share art through the Internet as a replacement for traditional live performances, including live concerts, or creating web festivals based on the web so that artists can distribute their works.
In online space, many Internet memes have spread with the context of the virus, so that many of them, amongst the lack of confidence, are making fun of humor.
Since the prevalence of Koved-19, the increase of discrimination, the fear of the people of China and the eastern Asian race and the people of the disease centers in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Abrasis region, there are cases of fear, suspicion, and behavior.
Reports from February (when most cases were still limited to China) show racist feelings in different groups around the world about the fact that people in China deserve this virus or experience a valid punishment.
Some countries in Africa also witnessed the rise of anti-inflicted emotions.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hobi have reported discrimination based on their regional home.
The support of China's population has been done online or in Areline, from those who are in extreme areas of the virus.
After the spread of disease into other countries, Italy's people, the first European country that experienced serious prevalence in Kovaid-19, were also exposed to suspicion and fear.
In Japan, the "CinseDunt House" became more Twitter on Twitter.
China's citizens and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist insults and attacks against themselves.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was critical for calling the virus "Vorus Chinese", was a racist and anti-informationist.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buss that were carrying the citizens of Ukraine and foreign citizens who were being removed from Wuhan and were moving to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from eastern India who shared borders with China and were studying in the main cities of India experienced persecution in connection with the spread of the virus.
The head of the state district of the Baratia Janata party in West Bangal announced that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "So, God has taken revenge on them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese diplomatic mission in Gatte, and was called "Small."
Many newspapers shared in money, they removed the cost of sharing for the entire or part of the virus's cover.
Many scientific publishers have available scientific articles related to the spread of the disease freely.
Some scientists quickly shared their results in previous versions of versions such as BioRxiv.
Respiratory disease – anti-pacterial disease, often in the region of the spread and transfer process.
Globalization and disease - deportation of globalization and transmission of disease
- A list of deaths and deaths because of terminal diseases.
The trafficking of wild animals and common diseases of humans and livestock - health risks related to non-massing wild animals.
A test for Corona's breathing disease (2019) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains ways to detect the presence of the virus and the produced enzymes in response to this infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by the RNA Corona detects the virus.
This experiment is unique, and it only detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This experiment is used to confirm very new or active infections.
It can be used to identify and monitor the population.
It shows how many people have been infected by people who have had very little or have not reported or had any symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, the exact death rate of the disease and the population security level can be identified.
Because of limited trials, until March 2020, no country has ever had reliable data on the rate of the spread of this disease in its population.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are many differences between countries.
This difference will probably affect the significant rate of death reported in some countries that may have been overly estimated in some countries.
This experiment that uses a reverse-replication chain reaction (RRR-CR) can be done on breathing samples taken in various ways, such as the lylustinex or the permination sample.
The results are usually specified between hours and two days.
The RCR test performed by the throat soak, only in the first week of the disease, provides reliable results.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while in the lungs it's being re-resolved.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken from the depth of breathing, or can also be used by coughing.
One of the first prototypes of PCR in January 2020 was invented in Berlin using a removation chain reaction (RRR-CR) and formed the basis of 25000 tests distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England also invented a method of testing until 23 January 2020 of South Korea on January 28, 2020, invented a clinical recognition Kate SARS-CoV-2 (PPP) based on PCR.
In China, the BGI was one of the first companies to receive an emergency use of PCRS-CV-2-based PCS-CV-2 from the National Health Organization of China. In the United States, the RC-C-RRR-RP-RPB gene was distributed in all of the bits of the virus, and the RRPRP gene, which is known as SARS-CoV-2.
One of the three genetic experiments in previous versions of Kate's experiment led to non-resolve results due to the failures and limitations of the CDC in Atlanta; this led to a total of February, averagely less than 100 samples a day.
By February 28, 2020, the experiment was not recognized by two parts, dependable, and after the state and local labs were allowed to test.
This experiment was confirmed by the food and medicine organization under emergency use. The U.S. commercial labs began to run this test early March 2020.
From March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that the Koveid-19 test was available all over the country.
The Queen Dignostics also used the Koveid-19 test from March 9, 2020 across the country.
There was no limit to the number of tests; taking and processing of the sample must be carried out based on the CDC order.
In Russia, the production and development of Kate's test was carried out by the capital of the country's country of viral research and biotech of VC.
On 11 February 2020, this experiment was recorded by the Federal Services Center for Health and Health and Health. On March 12, 2020, the Meeo clinic invented an experiment for COD-19.
On March 19, 2020, the FBI granted an emergency use permit for the M2000 system to the Abattt Laaborts; the FBI had already issued similar permissions for Halogic, Labcorp, and the Eermo Fisher Scitical System.
On March 21, 2020, Cupheid received an EUA license from the FBI for a test that would take 45 minutes.
The FPD has confirmed the test that uses a substrate of nuclesic acid instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't need an alternate temperature cycle, it can present positive results within five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there's about 18000 of these devices available in the United States, and Abonott expects him to deliver 5,000 tests each day by increasing production.
By reviewing research in March 2020, we can conclude that radio photos from the chest are a little bit of a diagnosis in early stages, while CT's findings can be specified even before the signs appear.
The common features in the CT are multi-plugal glass, with a side distribution, non-integration, and disintegration.
As the disease progresses, substrates occur, severe cover.
A research that compares PCR to CT in the Wuhan, which is the source of the current Pandmi, suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR and is less exclusive, as many of the features of CT are also covered with other lung diseases and disease processes.
Since March 2020, U.S. Radical College recommended that "CT should not be used as an anti-servistor or an initial test for diagnosis of Koved-19" from March 2020, CDC offers the PCR method for early S.R.
Part of the immune system's response to this infection is to produce enzymes, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infections in people after seven days or more signs of exposure to the population.
A high capacity auto system in many clinical labs will be able to do these experiments, but it will depend on the amount of production of each system.
For SLT, an example is usually used by environmental blood, although it is possible to use several parallel samples to follow the immune system.
For poCT, it is usually taken a sample of blood by digging skin.
Unlike PCR methods, there's no need to extract the process before the test. On March 26, 2020, FPD published a list of 29 institutions that had been informed of this organization as requested, and therefore they were now able to distribute their clinical experiments.
From April 7, 2020, only one test was approved under emergency use under the permission of the FBI.
There are hundreds of samples in a few hours, and therefore it is much faster than the traditional PCR test to identify the virus.
In the early April, England found that none of the tests he bought were good enough.
Hong Kong performed a plan that suspicious patients can stay at home, "The E.R. will give the patient a biopsy tube, put it in his mouth, and then return it, and then he gets the results.
In Germany, the National Health Insurance Association announced that it had the capacity of 12000 trials a day and that in the last week, it was tested from 10,000 people.
If the test is given by a doctor, the costs are paid by health insurance.
According to President Robert Kuk, Germany has the capacity to complete 10,000 tests a week.
Since March 19, it has been possible to test cars in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of trials in Germany was not known because only positive results were reported.
A lab questioner showed that by the calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of the week of 12/20, and the result was 33,491 (6.9%) positive for SARS-CV-2. In Israel, Tchron and Ramamm's researchers had developed a method for patient tests at the same time, they did it with only the combination of samples, and then they did it with more of the sample only when it was positive.
It took five days to build this lab and monitor it by the BGI Foundation, Wuang Jian, and models showed that if this experiment capacity could not be used, the number of cases would be over 47% more and the costs associated with quarantine.
The same examples of Wu-Yan labs were launched immediately in Shengen, Tiangen, Beijing and Shanghai, in total 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, the sum of the daily capacity reached 50,000 tests a day. Open text design published by Origami testing can test samples of one, 122 patients only using the QOD-19 test. These are balanced designs in small labs and without the need to check liquids.
By March, the lack of material and the lack of enough material had become a barrier to the large test in Europe, England and the United States.
This has made some writers look at the sample preparation protocols that include heating samples up to 98 degrees (208 degrees) to release the RN genome for further testing. On March 31, it was now announced that the Arab Emirates are now testing a lot of its country's population for the virus to be more powerful than any other country, and in this way it's going to be successful to get a major part of its population.
This is possible due to the ability to run a car and buy a large lab on the scale of the population of the country from group 42 and BGI (based on emergency diagnosis labs) in China.
This lab that has been built in 14 days is able to do tens of tens of thousands of tests per day and is the first lab with this scale that works outside China.
The various instructions of the experiment that aims for different parts of the genetic description of Cronos were provided in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German instructions to provide and send Kate to low-life countries where they don't have the resources to produce internal Kates.
German test kits were published on January 17, 2020, since the protocol provided by U.S. Control Centers was not available until 28 January, delaying the beginning of experiments in the United States.
In contrast, experts say that the wideness of the experiment in South Korea has helped to reduce the release of new Cronos.
The capacity to run tests is primarily built in private labs in the private sector over a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization asked for support of testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of preservation in the Coved-19s.
In March 2020, China reported problems in the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by CDC had perfect. Then the government took the baroological barriers from private experiments. Spain bought tests from the Chinese company Shenshen Byyyschenology Co Ltd, but found out that the results were not true.
The company explained that the wrong results may be the result of the problem with gathering samples or using the Kates.
The Spanish Minister announced that she wouldn't use the quality that provides the wrong results and replace them with the different test kit provided by Shenshen Biyais. 80% of the tests that the Czech Republic bought from China got the wrong results.
The Prime Minister Matoovich suggested that these Kates be thrown into the Danub River. At the Turkish Health Department, Aittan Kaara said: "The testing kit that Turkey bought from China has had a high error and they haven't put it "in use." The U.S. government bought 3.5 million tests from China, but in the early April 2020s he announced that these Kates were not able to be used.
The test and follow it has been positive to quarantine people whose results have been positive and the tracking of people associated with the positive result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus results.
The researchers who worked in the city of V2, Italy, where the first death of Koveid-19 in Italy, did two rounds of tests within ten days of the entire population of around 3,400 people.
About half of those who had a positive test had no symptoms, and all positive cases were quarantined.
By limiting the journey to public centers, new infections were completely destroyed.
By tracking serious people, limits, testing and quarantines of arrival passengers, Pondmi was developed in Singapore in 2020, although no strict restrictions such as the forced holiday of restaurants and shops.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore advised people to stay at home on March 28, but after holidays, schools were opened on March 23, and at their due time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed to track serious people, limits, testing, and quarantine the arrival passengers, including fewer holidays.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have done more tests than the number of deaths have much less death rate, probably because these countries are better able to identify who only have mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that have no capacity to test and national labs with limited experience in Coveid-19, five positive and 10 negative samples of the Koveid-19 test send themselves to one of the 16 World Health Organization's 16 labs to confirm.
From these 16 reference labs, seven cases in Asia, five cases in Europe, two cases in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following graph, the column is "recurred against all trials" due to the testing policy of each country.
If all other conditions are the same, " positive percent of all trials in a country where only people who have been accepted are tested at hospitals, compared to a country that tests every citizen as well as they have no symptoms.
A hand wash from which it is also referred to as hand health is the work of cleaning a person's hands to destroy soil, fat, micro-massisms, or other substances.
The washing of hands with soap continues to keep in the "symmmpathies" during the day prevent many diseases, for example, diabetes and the Web that is transmitted through the excretion.
For example, if people don't touch their nose, nose, or mouth before they touch their eyes, they may be infected with breathing diseases such as flu or cold.
Five important opportunities during the day when hands are important with soap are: before and after we go to the bathroom, after we clean up the child or use his diapers before feeding the child before eating, before eating before or after eating or touching meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends the washing of hands in the following cases:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After a change of diapers or cleaning a child after using a toilet.
After you've had it, you're gonna cough or you're gonna exist.
After the animal touch, animal waste, or feed the animals.
Medical health refers to medical health care.
If you wash your hand before giving medicine or medical care, you can avoid illness or take it to a minimum.
The primary purpose of washing hands is medically, to clean up the causes of disease (bectrias, viruss, or other micro-stimulators) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important to those who work with food or work in medical jobs, but it is important for everyone else.
The washing of the hand has many health benefits, including the minimum increase in flu, corrous, and other contagious diseases, preventing diabetes factors, the loss of breathing infections, for example.
And reduce the death rate of babies at home when they give birth.
A study in 2013 showed that healing in handwashing methods may lead to a small improvement in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the death rate of children can be reduced by promote simple changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate of these diseases almost 50 percent.
The actions that promote handwashing can reduce diabetes to about a third of the cases, and this compares to making clean water in low income areas.
48 percent reduction can be associated with soapwashing. The hand wash with soap as a habit that has been used in homes, schools and communities around the world, is only the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diabetes and breathing infections (ARI).
It is one of the most important causes of children's death under five years that causes about 1.8 million children to die each year.
It's about 3.5 million children per year.
According to UNSIF, turning hands into soap before food and using toilet to a strong habit can save more people than any vaccine or medical intervention, causing deaths from diabetes to almost half and reduce a quarter of the deaths caused by hypertensive infections.
The handwashing is usually linked to other health clinics as part of water, health and cleaning programs.
A hand wash also protects from a yellow infection that is transmitted directly through a physical contact.
One of the very bad effects of the hand's thumb is that the wash of the hand can cause the skin to dry, resulting in the damage to the skin.
A study in Denmark in 2012 showed that washing too much of the hands could lead to the skin that they also think of as "syma" or "symmmata", which is particularly common among health care employees.
The hand is also referred to as one of the signs of a obsession disorder (OCD).
Five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the flow of laundry, such as after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby, before feeding the baby, before eating, before eating, or after touching meat, fish or chicken.
Other cases where the right hand wash should be observed to prevent the disease from being transmitted are both before or after the treatment of a wound, after the cough, cough, or use of an animal; and after the contact with waste.
In many countries, the washing of hands with soap is very low.
In 2015, a study of handwashing in 54 countries showed that average in 38.7 percent of the families were used to washing their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest amount of soap to wash with soap; the United States is at 77 percent in the middle, and China is at the lowest level with 23 percent of the level.
The basic health care program performed by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of extensive measures to improve the level of health and education in children.
Two times a year is the main axis of the national program, along with the daily washing of hands with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride.
In Indonesia, the program has been successfully run.
Adding soap to water is effective in taking out micromassives from the skin.
The main function of soaps and cleaning materials is to reduce lawful barriers and increase lawfulity.
The water alone is an unresolved cleaner for the skin because fats and proteins that are part of organic soil are not easily solved in water.
However, the flow of enough water helps clean up.
The solid soap may be kept in itself because of the nature of reuseable use.
A small number of studies that have been transferred to bacteria from solid soap have concluded that the transfer of bacteria seems unlikely because bacteria are washed by the floor.
The CDC still believes that "the liquid supply that can be accessable without direct contact is better.
The anti-bacterial soap has been highly commercialized to people who care about health.
So far, there's no evidence that anti-intensive or disintegrating materials are effective in erasitating anti-intervesives in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soaps contain common anti-carbons such as trichululos, which are large types of organics that are immune to it.
So, even if antibiotics are not meant to be destroyed by antibiotics, these soaps may not be as effective as they are in the market.
Advanced formulations, along with superfluutant and skin protection matter, may contain acid (syds, syssyssyst acids, symbiic acids), as set up PH, active physic acids, and other skin-symmmbisms (Eves, vitamins, vitamins, methyl, methyl, plant) and comprehensive analysis showed that it is as effective as normal as normal as normal as non-resolulent soap containing bacteria to prevent disease and remove bacteria from disease.
The hot water used to wash hands isn't hot enough to destroy bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at temperature (37 degrees c.g.
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water compared to soap in destroying natural oil containing soil and bacteria.
However, despite the general imagination, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect on the loss of microbes.
The anti-intensive material is a non-water health material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based drugs (also known as alcohol-based anti-intensive or anti-intensive.
Most of these are made of alcohol precipitating, or estimating, as well as thick matter, such as carbumler acid, and as a ginger, or to be used to reduce alcohol's drying effect from a glycyline, such as liquid or floor.
Adding high-intensive hydrogen will increase the more anti-massive activity.
The anti-intensives of alcohol containing alcohol can cause bacteria to go away, bacteria with multiple drugs (MRSA and VRE), C and some virus (such as HIV, fever, RSV, RSV, RRV), cow, flu, flu, and fungitite).
The anti-orbitators that contain 70 percent of alcohol, 30 seconds after use, caused 99.97% to be destroyed, and a minute after the use of 3.5% of the hand and 1 minutes after the use, resulting in the loss of 99.99% to 99.99.99%.99% of the hand-to-5-gag (rescuiters of bacteria). The anti-regressors of the hand against the bacteria are less effective than some of the virus.
The anti-symbillists based on alcohol, almost against the type of virus, which is the most common cause of amorphism disease, are completely inexplicable.
The back and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers must be cut for about 30 seconds until the liquid, fuse, or leaven.
The tip of the finger should also be washed well with both hands.
It is due to the growing use of these materials because of their use and their ability to destroy microbisms quickly; however, they should not be used as a substitute for the appropriate washing of hands unless soap and water are not available.
Reused use of alcohol-based alcohol-based anti-resolves can result in the dryness of the skin unless it is added to their formulations or continuings.
Adding glysin or other smoothers to their formula can reduce or reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
In the experiments, the anti-servators of the hand containing alcohol and soft materials created much less skin heat than soaps or microsynthesis, and dry land.
In Alargic contact, a long-term syndrome or alcohol allergic to alcohol, or added substances in the hand-in-laws of alcohol, rarely occur.
The lower probability of creating a call in your system, compared to washing hands with water and soap, made them attractive.
Despite their effect, water-based materials don't clean hands from organic materials, but they're anti-resolved.
That's why anti-resolves are not as effective as soap and water to prevent many diseases from spreading, because disease factors remain on the hands.
The effect of the anti-intensives without alcohol depends heavily on the substance and formulation of them, and historically has had less impact on the anti-septic alcohol containing alcohol.
It has recently been shown that the formulations that use the cylinide of the Bensoleum have a more continuous and more continuous anti-symmmass activity, unlike alcohol, which, after repeated use, are likely to reduce its effect due to negative skin responses.
Many people in low income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or soil.
The ashes or soil may be more powerful than the water alone, but may have less effect than soap.
One of the concerns is that if the soil or ashes are infected with microbisms, it may increase the spread rather than reduce the disease.
The ashes, such as soap, are an anti-intensive material, because in contact with water, they form a liquid solution.
If there is no soap, the World Health Organization recommends ashes or sand as a substitute for soap.
The right way to wash the hand that is recommended by the U.S. Control Centers to prevent the transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold water.
The current water is recommended because the code waters may be infected, while the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Put your hands on enough soap and rub them together, including the back of your hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
The soap takes away the microbes on the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than when they only use water.
Put your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
And it's going to create a few hands, and it's going to help remove microbes from the skin, and it's going to take more microbes for longer.
Draw your hands with good water.
Cleaning up in the water can resuscitate the hand.
Clean up with a towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and wet hands can easily be infected. The most part of the hand sitting is like thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and under the nails.
Analytic nails and nail nails may be hidden from microsmisms.
The wet worm is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying. The skin's drying leads to skin damage and can increase risk of transmission infection.
There's a lot of money for the developing countries if there's no water in the water or soap available. For example, the drop of water from a gallon or a pot or a hole or if it's necessary to use ashes.
It is a simple technology that is made of a vessel hanging by rope and a controlled leverage by foot to pour some water on the hands and a soap format.
It is an important part of the health process of hands, but there are debates about the most effective form of drying hands in public bathrooms.
A massive amount of research shows that paper towels are much more healthier than electric dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study with paper paper industry support was held by the University of West Minster in London to compare the health rate of paper towels, dryer air, and more modern jets.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria in the tip of the finger grew to the average rate of 1.4% and the palm bacteria of the hands at the rate of 254%.
The drying of hands with the air drying machine led to an increase in average number of bacteria in the tip of the finger to 42% and in the palm of the hand to 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria in the tip of their fingers was reduced at 77% and in the palm of their hands. The scientists also did experiments to determine if there was a chance of resusciproving other users' pollution from the bathroom and washing environment because they were using different ways to dry the hand.
The air dryer device, which, according to claims, is able to remove air at 180 meters per second (650 km or 400 miles per hour), is capable of microbisis from the hands and device, and can potentially infect the rest of those using the bathroom and also the bathroom environment from 2 meters away.
The use of hot air dryer can spread micro-masses from the dryer to a distance of 0.25 meters.
Paper towels didn't cause significant micro-massation. In 2005, they were examined in a study done by T3V Produkut Ormwith, various ways of drying the hand.
The following changes were seen in a number of bacteria after the drying of hands:
There's a lot of dryer machine producers, and the dryer machines are compared to drying hands with paper towels.
If there is no soap or water available during the journey, hand wash can be used as a substitute if the hand's hand is washed.
In the case of alcohol, alcohol has at least 60% of alcohol.
A long time after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Smmelviis recognized the effect of washing the hand (in 186) in preventing disease in the hospital environment, the medical wash of the hand was forced.
There are electronic devices that can be reminded if the hospital staff has forgotten to wash their hands.
A study showed that the infection rate was reduced using them.
It is at least 15 seconds for medicalwashing, which is done using enough soap and water or jazz and all the parts of the hand.
The hands must be torn apart and the fingers fall apart.
If there's dirt under the nails, you can use a lamb to remove it.
Since the microbes may remain in the water on the hands, it's very important that the hands are drawn well and dry with a clean towel.
After the drying of the hand, paper towels must be used to close water milk (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents them from re-recognising their hands due to contacting those levels.
The purpose of washing hands at health clinics is to eliminate micro-massing and prevent their transmission.
New England's medical journal reports that the lack of hands in most hospital environments is unacceptable, so many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before they contact patients and thus cause microbiologists to be transferred.
A study showed that the proper washing of the hand and other simple routines could reduce 66 percent of the blood flows that the Cutter is involved in.
It is also available to the public on the website.
A study of the subject was done by Waitby and colleagues.
If necessary, business devices can measure and confirm the amount of hand health.
The World Health Organization has specified five times to wash hands:
After being exposed to blood/intensives.
Before you do anti-intensive things, and...
After the patient's care. Adding anti-intensive chemicals to soap (datas or anti-insurgents) will strengthen the nature of the washing factor.
Such actions may be considered before the surgery or in an environment where the immune organism is very high on antibiotics. To wash the hands before the surgery is done, the water milk that can be opened and closed without direct contact is required: you've picked up some reservation, or, if you've had, the symbal towels for drying up your hands after them and cleaning up other things for the below.
All jewelry must be brought out.
In this way, it is required that the arm and arm be washed to the elbow for usually 2-6 minutes.
You don't have to wash long (10 minutes).
When drawing water, prevent the water from returning to the hands.
After the washing of the hand, the hands will be dried up with the steel cloth and the surgery will be dressed.
In order to reduce the spread of microbis, it is best to cut off the hands or use the patient’s anti-resolver before or after taking care of the patient.
To control the infections in hospitals, it turns out that most of the benefits of cleaning hands from the first 20 percent of the wash are found in the first 20 percent, and when the cleaning of the hand reaches more than 35%, it has very few benefits.
To wash hands with normal soap compared to anti-bacterial soap to three times more would be the transfer of bacteria to food.
But the use of soap and water is more effective than washing hands with alcohol-based materials in reducing the H1N1 virus of H1N1 and the cystrium diphysyl.
More research is needed to determine which of these actions is more effective in different health care environments.
In developing countries, it is referred to as washing hands with soap as a fundamental tool to reach good health and even proper food.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing equipment at home, schools and workplaces challenge the way you need to wash your hands worldwide.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water lions are rare for washing hands near private or public bathrooms, although there are cheaper options to build hands.
However, the low-hand washing rate, mostly not because there's no soap or water, but it could be the result of our bad habits.
The hand washing promotion with soap can affect choice policy, raise knowledge of the benefits of washing up the hand and cause long-term behavior of society.
This is necessary to ensure that this will take place.
The study of the 70 study shows that social-based methods of society are effective in increasing the amount of washing hands in low income and average countries, while social campaigns are less effective. One of the examples is "three stars" by ionism that motivates schools to take simple, cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
By maintaining at least standards, schools can eventually be promoted from one star to three stars.
The construction of the washing stations of the hand can be part of the commercial action to wash the hand, which is done to reduce the disease and death in children.
The global clean-up day is another example of intelligence programs that aims to change people's behavior. As a result, Pondmi Cronos, 20-2019, the ionisph, promoted the use of the handwashing ions.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the cost of washing hands in developing countries about the number of years lost due to disability.
However, a check shows that the hand-to-be-to-be wash-up promotion with soap compared to other actions is more economicly costable.
For the first time, the importance of washing hands for human health -- especially for people who are in vulnerable situations, such as mothers who just gave birth and wounded soldiers at the hospital -- were found by two health pioneers in the middle of the 19th century: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Seglens, who worked in Vienna, and the English "Flellinging House", who was a modern nurse of health.
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by a bad smell called masma.
In the 1980s, the spread of food and health infections associated with health care led to the spread of control and preventing disease in the United States to promote the hand health as an important way to prevent infection.
In 2009, pig flu spread in the U.S. and Podmi Coveid-19 in 2020 led to increased consciousness in many countries about the importance of washing soap with soap to protect itself from the disease.
For example, the poster was installed as "The Right Hand's Clean Ways" along with the toilets in the public toilets and the toilets in the office buildings and the German airports.
The term "washing hands of something" means to declare the lack of desire to take responsibility for a matter or to share it.
This term is taken from the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate has refused to give up his decision to crucify Christ, but this term is now used in some English communities with a much larger application.
In Macbret Shakespeare, Mrs. Macbeth has been forced to wash his hands in an attempt to clean an illusion, which shows his guilty conscience for the crimes he committed and urged his wife to commit.
It also turns out that people tend to wash their hands more than others after they remember or meditate on immoral actions.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation may be less likely to participate in the rest of the "fortification" measures such as voluntary work.
Religions recommend washing hands for physical and symbolic purposes. It's symbolic, water, and soap for washing hands that are part of the hand's washing religion in many religions, such as the oil, the Hinduism, and the art of teaching in Jewish, the pool, and Christendom.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam command the washing of hands after using toilets.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, sicism, Jewishism and Islam recommend the washing of hands before and after each meal.
Control of the risk of Koved-19 at work.
In the workplace, the risk control of the Kwaid-19 is the use of safe health methods to control the risk to prevent the disease of the Coronios 2019 (coid-19).
The right control of the risks in the workplace depends on the workplace and the type of job, and should be done based on the assessment of risk resources, severe illness in society, and risk factors for employees who may be exposed to the Kwaid-19.
According to the United States Health and Health Department (OSHA), less dangerous jobs have less business contact with ordinary people and other colleagues, and are recommended to prevent infections, including washing hands, to encourage workers to stay home if they are ill, to observe and maintain the routines and maintain the daily cleaning and non-infligation of the work environment.
The activities that are at risk average include jobs where employees need to call or contact people who have not been infected or suspected or suspected, but they may be infected due to constant spread of the virus in society or due to international travel.
This includes people who are in contact with public, for example, at schools, working environments with large population density and in some stores with high volumes.
The risk control for this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, includes air ventilation through high air filters with high re-resolves and personal protection equipment if faced with the person who was infected with the CO2-19.
The U.S. occupational and occupational health services (OSHA) also know that people who are exposed to people who are infected or suspected of CO2-19 know that they're in great danger. If employees do things that lead to the production of floating particles in the air, or collect examples of people who are suspected of CO2-19, they're in very high danger.
The proper way to control the danger for these people includes engineering control, such as creating negative pressure rooms and using personal protection equipment to fit the job.
The Coveid-19 outbreak can have many different effects on the work environment.
An employee may not be present at work due to illness, need to care for others or fear of a possible encounter.
Business patterns may change, both in terms of what is needed and in terms of the means to access these goods (such as buying or buying through delivery services at home or car).
In the end, carrying at least at least one of the far-out areas that are highly affected by Koved-19 can be stopped.
These programs examine the risk of working and working tasks, including resources exposed to disease, home and community factors and risk factors for employees, such as old age or chronic diseases.
It also describes control measures necessary to solve those dangers and possible programs to deal with situations that may result in the spread.
Prepares and programs that are provided to respond to pardonable diseases may be based on national or local advice.
The purpose of response to the spread of disease includes reducing the transmission between employees, protecting people who are more exposed to the side effects of health, maintaining commercial activities and reducing negative influences on other institutions in their supply chain.
The disease in areas where commercial activities affects decision-making.
The risk control chain consists of a frame that is widely used in health and occupational health so that it can be classified according to its effect.
In cases where there is no way to remove the risk of CO2-19, control is the most effective methods of control, engineering control, and following the authority of the authorities and at the end of personal protection equipment.
The method of engineering controls requires to keep employees away from the risk of work without relying on the behavior of employees and can be the most efficient solution that can be performed.
An office control method includes changes in politics or employment methods performed by an employee or employer.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and office control methods, but it can be somewhat preventive from being exposed to the virus.
All types of PPEs must be chosen based on the danger for employees (for example, the breathing device) are constantly installed, kept and kept, taken properly, clean, and thrown away to prevent pollution properly or properly.
According to the United States Health and Health and Health Office (OSHA), jobs less dangerous have less job contact with ordinary people and other colleagues.
Basic measures that are recommended to prevent infections in all working environments include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining breathing manners, including mouthing and noseing during coughing, making paper and waste buckets, preparing for distance work, or if necessary, to not use tools and equipment and cleaning equipment and regular work.
A quick identification and separation of persons who are potentially infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and other people at work.
The U.S. disease centers (CDC) suggest that employees who have severe symptoms should stay at home until they are aware of the policy without the use of fever or other changes in symptoms, fever symptoms, fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours, and that the insurance policy should be flexible for family care, and the employees are aware of the policy.
According to the TE Office (OSHA), jobs that are in danger at the average level include jobs where employees need to call over or near six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not infected or suspected, but may be infected due to the spread of the virus on the surface of society or due to international travel in the region that has been published in Coved-19-2.
This includes employees who are in contact with public, such as schools, public environments with high population density and some crowded markets. The engineering method for these and higher risk groups can include installing air filters with high power, increasing air pressure, installing physical barriers like plastic protection for micros and installing car services to customers.
In this group, employees who are in danger rarely need to use a breathing device.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate ways to protect employees and other passengers can include separateing a patient from another person from six feet away, devotion to only one of the crew to serve the patient and offer a mask to the patient, or asking the patient to wear his mouth and nose during cough or cough.
The crew must use medical gloves once in case the patient has a fever, cough or breathing problem.
The gloves and other equipment must be thrown into a bio-automatic bag, and the infected levels must be cleaned up after that. For commercial transports and other passenger ships, it is to control the risk of delaying the journey, quarantine, and if a fever or other symptoms occur during the journey, informing the medical center in the ship immediately.
In the ideal case, medical followouts should be done in the quarantined cabinet. For schools and child care centres, if an infected person entered the school building regardless of the spread of the disease in society, the control centers suggest that the place is closed for a short period of time to clean up or prevent the anti-intention.
If there is a disease transfer in society at least or average, the following actions can be performed in the social distance: canceling scientific rounds, meetings and other large communities such as sports classes or eating food in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, putting distances between people's times and firing, limiting necessary visitors and the use of health care for children who have flu symptoms.
In addition to social distances, long-term school holidays must be considered. For law staffs who do their everyday activities, the control centers and preventing disease (CDC) are low-level health risk.
The law enforcement officers who need to communicate with people who are infected or suspicious of the CO2-19 are recommended to follow instructions that medical emergency techs follow, including the proper personal protection equipment.
If you have a close call, an employee must use your seat belt and equipment before you re-use your home cleaners or clean paper, while also use standard methods to use and remove personal protection equipment (PE) and wash clothes.
The U.S. occupational health and health services office (OSHA) knows health care employees, for example, who are in grave danger.
The high-level jobs include health services employees, support, labs and medical transport that have been exposed to people who are suspected of COD-19.
The employees whose work leads to the production of floating particles in the air, or the samples of infected people or suspects, are in very high danger.
The work that leads to the production of floating particles in the air includes pipeing, coughing, indulgence, and some of the surgery and dental examinations or an aggressive sample of the patient.
The jobs that are in very high danger include employees who are preparing the bodies of people who were either infected or suspected of the death of Koved-19. If the autopsy did, the risk level would go very high.
In some health clinics, negative pressure air pressure may be appropriate.
In case of the patient, the patient must be treated with cautionary measures on level three.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if new patients are in the care room of Coved-19, they'll be kept in a separate waiting room. In addition to other personal protection equipment, the TEA recommends the use of air care systems for people who work within six feet of patients or suspicious of CO2-19, and for those who do things that cause them to be suspended in the air.
In the United States, use the N95 breathing device approved by NIOSH and according to the terms of a comprehensive breathing program containing proper tests, training and medical examinations.
Other kinds of breathing machines can protect and make it easier for employees. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of full body coverage because the Kovaid-19 is a breathing disease and it's not transmitted through the fluids of the body.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of surgery mask for people in input points.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses, faces and gloves for people who collect the breathing systems of the patient's breathing system, or take care of CO2-19 patients, and do nothing that leads to the production of floating particles in the air.
If you do what's going on, the floating particles in the air are replaced by N95 or FFP2.
As the global supply of personal protection isn't enough, the World Health Organization recommends the following cases to limit the need for personal protection: doing medical examinations in non-intensibility, building physical obstacles such as installing clear windows, letting people directly in the room, using personal protection tools to do specific things, using a mask when they're taking care of several patients who are ill and not using personal masks for people who don't have symptoms.

This month we see ourselves in a significant situation.
It's all around Coveid-19 is something that clearly explains the universal human nature and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response to empathy, cooperation, and communityization depends on the heart of this organization.
The company and the level of care we've seen among our colleagues through e-mail, call, and chat, shows incredible people that we have the chance to work alongside them.
I'm very grateful to have you all with me as a partner.
Last week, someone appreciated what we're doing.
They reminded me how meaningful it is that the universe can now turn to Viki, and what a powerful sign this important source can be online and available to everyone.
Your work provides this possibility, whether you keep sites updated or our colleagues get paid or our communities are safe.
The world now needs more information than ever before.
This is a moment where not only do we do but also our way of working will affect the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to be doing very much in the way we do our common work since next week.
Our work and plans.
As Robin mentioned earlier, Tim-C met last night to discuss our approach and plan for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was a good answer to what we were facing and the best way to stand up to the organization.
We wanted to destroy stress and support our long-term mission.
It's okay if you need to reduce.
To all employees, contractors and employees:
Until further notice, we expect four hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We're not calling off -- if you can work more normal hours, you're good at this mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable and it doesn't matter if you're taking care of your loved ones, buying food, or looking at a doctor, your health is first for us.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are ill, do not work.
This has to go without saying it, but we say it.
You do not need to take private leave - just tell your manager and help your group to review calendars and programs and make sure that someone has covered key tasks.
(If the result is positive, please report to Bryan from the TGAC so that TGAC can help you and make sure that your situation is handled correctly.
An employee’s fee is paid full-time.
As we've said before, we pledge our commitment to contractors and colleagues who work an hourly.
The salary is paid according to the normal working hours.
This includes you even if you are ill and you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way out of stress to the world around us.
What we do, especially in such situations, can be very valuable.
Again, I insist, it's about your self-care.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what we should expect and that we can plan it properly.
Some things are considered necessary.
There are things we need to do.
SRE teams, HROs, trust and safety and interest (and others) do important and important things that may require more support.
We're going to start a process with other departments to evaluate the current goals and focus on the support of essential issues for our mission.
There's a lot of work for all of us, we're all going to focus on the most fundamental projects.
If we slow down now, we won't get hurt later.
We don't have plans to work twice as long as it's done and to handle things now.
You are not expected to work for additional hours to fulfill the opportunities that are impossible right now.
We admit that conditions have changed, and we will try to determine new goals and schedules if necessary.
How's the PP?
In order to match the new context and expectations of daily working hours, we're going to go over our annual delivery table 2021-20.
Our goal is to suggest an extension of the 2020-2019 program that gives us more time to budget and allows employees to put vital work, care for themselves and care for their loved ones first, and also allow people who need to work less hours over the next few weeks.
This extension reduces the amount of current working programs to a lot of time throughout the organization.
We'll present our offer to the board next week, and as soon as it's confirmed, we'll inform the delegates and teams in the next step.
Thanks to the annual planning team for the leadership.
Office status, exposure to illness and cleaning
Last week, we've been informed that one of the base partners in SF may have been exposed to the COF-19 virus.
However, for further caution, we hired an anti-virus cleaner team to counter all levels in San Francisco's office.
They used the first-class anti-virus solution to counter all levels and also to the lobby and elevator that leads to our floor.
The building uses its care protocol and uses products that are useful to its residents.
We're sure the office will be ready when we decide to go back.
Our Washington office is located in a VWWK, and they share the Coved-19 protocol with us and all the base employees in the DC.
According to San Francisco State Order, our Washington D.C. office has become a completely remote set since last week.
As some of our base colleagues in New York know, we've also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These arguments will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work for the first time away.
The old colleagues who work with us from afar, they know it could be a match and they want to give you advice:
You must limit the duration of the meetings to at least one or two hours.
If you need longer meetings, check how you can organise them in a few days.
Make the meeting clear, order work and send the necessary information to the study beforehand.
Set the video with tools such as Google Docs and Zims by default so that you can develop live cooperation and communication.
Set someone in charge of the meeting’s leadership to monitor chat questions and list Talkers and anyone to write a joint note (or note).
If you need an easy target, send e-mail to a technical support group.
Use your health allowance for the middle of the appointment.
Join the channel #remoties at Siell to talk to your colleagues about the shared work.
The operating team of human resources to support the increase of work that has been divided across the foundation is looking for a guidance based on observation.
Last week we asked all the crediters at the foundation level, such as Aditon, to cancel public events held by Viki Madia budget, until the World Health Organization has declared the end of the Modenmi Health Organization.
We inform them that we know that our request to cancel programs and other restrictions can make it impossible to do agreement activities regarding financial privileges and no one will be punished due to delaying or correcting their goals.
Next week we'll give more instructions about Wikimania and other social relations in the field and district.
It seems that public sense throughout the world is also sad because of these problems and at the same time it feels relief due to their transparency and their ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Vicki Madia and so on.
As we go forward, C8 is trying to create a page in Meta-Wiki to give the community space to monitor the effects of the influence and keep our communication with them.
In connection with Coved-19 issues,
We'll send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday at 14 pm at UTC with 07 p.T.
We'll use this time and give you more and more information, we'll answer your questions, and we'll spend some time talking to each other.
We're all together about this, and we're here to help you in any way possible.
In addition, you can find information related to this e-mail and other information related to Koved-19 at Ofice Wiki.
C.C. updates these pages and keeps all information in one place.
We're also trying to make regular contact with those of our employees who live in countries that are now highly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, work flow or challenging news coverage or anything you may need help with, please do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with CI.
We're here to help and support you if necessary.
If you want to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please e-mail Bryan Judan - the international CEO of Human Resources.
None of these changes should be considered to leave our work and commitments.
But it shows that at this moment, our work and commitments are probably going to need to be based on the way that we didn't have in the past.
These are the steps that we believe is necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work and support our movement and offer the services that the world trusts.
The things we've planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now it's time to support each other and create space for important things that are going to be done in weeks and probably months ago.
We need all of you to do this, so we want you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need increases.
Now, please close your hands and don't touch your face!
Kareine (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan D, Greeny, Gregry V, J, Jome V, Joll L, Rayte L, Ray, and Tony S) and the rest of the team's leadership (Gan I, Hatter I, James V, Jane, Jane, Ross, Rossa, Ronnie A, Roni, and Toby).
B'n'ingenin 2 (AE2) is an angitinin (AE2) that binds to the outer level (cell) cells, lungs, heart, kidneys, kidneys, kidney, and guts.
AE2 disrupts angitin-II and increases the amount of angitin (AE) and increases that ability has turned it into a potential drug for treatment of heart disease. AE2 also acts as a point of entry to the cell for some corrosives.
The human version is often referred to as HACE2.
Angitinsin 2 is a type of metal on the surface of the endal cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-T-Termal precipitide of M2 and an amino amino acid range of C-T-Terminal colacre.
AE2 is a single-orbital protein of the I type, which is located around the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
AE2 is separated from the triangular domain, and the protein of resulting after entering the flow of blood flow is finally removed with urine.
AE2 is available in most organs: AE2 to bubble cells of the type II, mostly erosion, small continuances of the intestines, as well as black cells, and flat muscle cells.
The signs of AE2 mRNA are seen in the brain cortox, the matter of the cross-lined, hypothalamus, and the stem of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is the activity as an ACE disarmer.
ACE converts angitosin I to a tight angitosin II.
ACE2 itself separates amino amino acid from angillinyl acid (ASP-AG-Val-L-Ill-E-Preis-Phehehee), and into angitin (H-As-Ag-T-T-Ill-H-H-H-H-H-O).
AE2 can break a number of other peppertides such as (des-AG9)-Bred Kane, Aplin, Nuttensin, Dylan A and Grelin.
AE2 also sets the amino amino acid-carrying fluid and plays part in the creation of Hart Nadu's disease.
ACE2 plays the role of the primary point of entry to the cell, such as HCV-NL63; SARS-CVV (SARS-CVV-2) and SARS-CV-2 (SARS-CV-2) (SARS-CV-2).
More importantly, the SARS-CV virus (SARS-CoV2) and SARS-CV2 are the domain of the ACE2 enzyme at the surface of cells, causing the indentation and transport of virus in cells.
This input process requires preparing S protein by TMPRS2 of the host's prosecuting protocol, which is considered to be possible treatment in the hands of an ACE2.
However, many professional communities and surveillance institutions have suggested that the treatment with standard ACE and the FIB continue.
On July 11th, 2012, the checkout of the Mand and Presidation of the releases found that "the use of ACE suppressors is associated with a significant 34 percent of the probability of organic nature compared to the controls."
In addition, "the probability of al-sacrific nature was treated in patients with an ACE immunization, which was more likely to be caused by alcoholism, especially those who had had a stroke and heart failures.
The use of ACE suppressors had been associated with the loss caused by alcoholic nature, although the results were weaker than the general outcomes of the possibility of acnetic nature.
The theory is that ACE is considered a new treatment for a critical lung injury, and apparently healed the resymbisis and oxygen density in the pig’s disservation of the diastrosis syndrome caused by Lee Scudide.
The half-life of RHACE2 is about 10 hours in humans and the beginning of the operation of 30 minutes plus the effect period (the period) is 24 hours.
Some findings indicate that RHACE2 may be a promising drug for people with system- and classic regenerative regenerative regeneration of RSA (RSA), or an OI disease is the effect of RHCE2 injections in clinical trials for treatment of hypertension syndrome.
B'd 19 is a mobile phone software program that is used to conduct calls during the Pondmi–2019 period, the process of identification of people who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many programs have been developed or have been suggested that some countries and areas support government authorities.
Several frames have been developed to prepare calls traffic programs.
The problem with privacy has been found especially in the system based on the destination of the program's users.
A smaller intervention can be used to refer to other mobile phones in order to register a user close to the user.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would be able to support Bluetooth-Madhur programs directly in their operating systems and IOS.
In China, the Chinese government has developed a program that citizens can use to find out if they have contact with the people with the Kovaid-19s.
This program is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it is used as a program called "Rece Teugter".
The program has been developed by local IT community, released as a source, and will be released to the government.
The program has developed the Ministry of communications and technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, this program has been waiting for the confirmation of the Google Google and Apple.
On April 12th, the government announced that the call program was in the advanced level of development and will be set up in a few weeks; the same program is performed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and Zellandino are considering programs based on the "ReceTier" protocol. Russia is planning on setting up a range for patients with the Koved-19s and residents of Moscow to prevent these people from getting out of the house.
Ross Anderson, the professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, points to some of the problems that apply to program systems, including false and possible positive results if they use the program in small population samples.
Apple has made restrictions on the types of organizations that are allowed to be added to the Apple and allows only the "inheritable" or valid organizations.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
The private defenders have expressed concern with public surveillance issues using the Coronaus programs and have specifically announced whether the infrastructure of the surveillance structure for Panandmi Cronos will be removed after the threat has been solved.
International pardon and more than 100 other organizations have requested the limit of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have counted eight conditions for government designs:
The surveillance must be "a law, a law, and a balance."
The surveillance attachments must contain links with the ability to automatically cancel;
Data applications must be limited to the Kwaid-19 cases;
Data and unknown security must be guaranteed and protected based on evidence;
digital surveillance should not be a non-discrimination and disunity field;
The transfer of data to third persons must be in the law frame;
Guarants must be taken into account for preventing the abuse and rights of citizens from complaining about abuse;
It is necessary to participate in all of the "Sys related benefits," including public health experts and groups in the border.
Google/Eple's proposal was offered by the purpose of maintaining constant surveillance problem by removing the mechanisms from their device operating systems, after the necessary fixation.
In some countries, rather than the program, the network-mort location process has been used and therefore the necessary download of the program and the ability to escape.
In Israel, a network-resolation has been passed.
Network-streaming methods that have access to raw space data may violate privacy.
However, it is not possible that all central server systems need access to personal location data; a number of private privacy systems use central servers only for internal communication (see below).
In South Korea, there was a non-sympathetic system used to direct the call.
Instead of using a technical program, the system collected information from various sources, including machine traffic data and card transactions, and used to notify people that they were probably infected.
In addition to using this information to send messages to possible audiences, the government has available local information. It is allowed to reveal information from the broad changes of data laws, due to the spread of the MERS in this country.
This information is available through a number of programs and websites. Some countries like Germany have considered the use of private and private privacy systems.
Until April 6, 2020, these details haven't been revealed yet.
It is accepted that the record of documentary research related to at least 2013 will return to at least. Until April 7, 2020, there were tens of professionals working on private privacy, such as the use of low bluetooth (BLE), to record the user's closeness to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT effort is a match that handles focused and non-integration methods and is not independent protocol. From non-intensive protocols, it can be referred to as "integration with privacy protection" (PPPT/3T), temporary contact numbers, "CN", "CN", "CN" and "CN" communication mechanisms".
In these protocols, personal data never leaves the machine, and all match cases occur inside the device.
The "Stream" group was developing SFPs, platforms to use private privacy methods in the process of gathering and using location data and pathing process, to find out how to process the Kovaid-19-19 process.

With secure hardware technologies, SufreTrace allows users to give sensitive health and health data to other users without breaking the privacy of data.
On April 5th, 2020, the world association was formed by a number of groups. These groups gathered together on the axis of what was basically similar and mostly covered with the purpose of reducing and providing global cooperation in the field of traffic and warning programs, from the key aspects of access to wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BleeTrace protocol was being used in its official government program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, control firms with both the Nordenide and IOS, demonstrated a call-to-do initiative that they claim is to maintain privacy. It's based on the combination of low bluetooth technology and the encryption of privacy.
They've also published the original technologies of technology used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is going to be launched in three steps:
Introduction of the government's ability to create the Coronaus-projective programs with the ability to maintain privacy.
The direct merge of this ability in iOS and Andrid. Google and Apple are going to solve constant acceptance problems by distribution this system through the operating system update and then remove it in the same way after the threat is resolved.

In March 2020, the government, the industry department and three U.S. universities combined their resources to access the IP superconductors and their super-communization sources, the Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have non-generative effects or non-integration effects.
It means that they may have benefits beyond preventing the disease.
Another random work in Australia is due to register from 4.170 active health care services.
The vaccines at the production stage may not be safe or effective.
The initial research to evaluate the vaccine's effect by using animal patterns ACE2, other lab animals and non-humans, shows the need to prevent environmental infections from working with live virus and international harmony for standard security routines.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal patterns.
By 2020, there is no vaccine for treatment or preventing sarus which has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research articles published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications for treatment of Saris has been the priority of public health institutions worldwide.
During the spread of the Meres, it was thought that current research on Merus would probably provide a useful format to develop vaccines and drugs against the MERS-CV infection.
Until March 2020, there was a sinus vaccine (MVS) that had taken the clinical testing of the human phase II, and there were three other vaccines that were all viral.
The views published in social media have promoted conspiracy theory about the known virus of Coveid-19 and the existence of the vaccine.
The inventions mentioned in different social media refer to earlier genetic sequences and vaccines related to other types of corross, such as Coronios Saruss.
B'n'n'orus 2019 (coved-19) is a term that is known by the cause of hyper-symnia syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The general symptoms of the fever are cough and breathing.
Other symptoms can be referred to as fatigue, pain, diabetes, throat pain, loss of hearing and stomach pain.
The distance to the disease factor is usually about five days, but it may be two to 14 days.
Although most cases lead to small symptoms, some are due to multiple-interference and multi-information disorder.
By April 17, 2020, over 2.24 million cases were reported around the world from 124 countries and countries, which have led to death.
More than 568 people have improved. This virus is mostly transmitted from close contact, often through small drops of cough, cough, or talk.
Even though my arm releases these drops, the drops usually fall instead of moving long distances on Earth or on surfaces.
People may be infected by touching infected levels and then touching eyes, noses, and mouth.
The virus can live on surfaces for 72 hours.
The possibility is that the virus is higher in three days after the symptoms have appeared, of course, before the symptoms have appeared and in the next stages of disease.
The use of masks is recommended for suspicious people with virus and those around them.
The advice to use the mask is different for the public; some authorities disagree against the use of the mask and some of it, and some feel compelled to wear the mask.
Right now, there is no particular vaccine or antiviral treatment for CO2-19.
===VHO===The local transfer of disease in most countries has been recorded under WHO cover.
People with this virus may have no symptoms or flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and fatigue.
Emergency symptoms can be referred to as breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, sympathies, face or lips. If these symptoms do not go away, you must go to a doctor immediately.
The symptoms of the upper breathing channel, such as the furressing, nose fluid, or throat pain, have also been seen with less outbreaks.
Its stomach symptoms are seen as nausea, depression, and diabetes in the percentages of the variable.
Some cases in China in early stages had just suffered severe heart rate and extreme heart rate.
In some other cases, disease may continue until the phase of the disease is occupies, multi-partial defect, and even death.
The period is called a period of deformation.
It is usually five to six days, but it may be two to 14 days.
At 97.5% of people, symptoms appear in 11.5 days from the moment of infection. Reports show that not all infected persons are necessarily marked.
The role of these non-existing carriers is not yet clear in the transition process.
The ratio of non-signed people is not yet known and is in check. "KCDC" has announced that 20% of the confirmed cases remain in the hospital without mark.
"The Chinese National Health Committee" began to include non-existence cases in its statistics since April 1 April.
Both continuity and occupants may be carrying the virus.
Talking with loud sounds spreads more particles than slow talk.
The Singaporen researchers proved that without covering the mouth and nose during cough, it may cause small drops to release from four to five feet (15 feet).
Although this virus is not usually weather, the National Academy of Sciences has announced that there is a possibility of transmission through the air and that there are positive traces of the virus that are installed in the hallway outside the room.
Some medical routines, such as tubes and heart-respiration (CPR), may cause air-respiration and spread virus through air.
Although there are concerns about virus transfers through filth, it's a rare possibility that the virus is more likely to be transmitted through people. The probability of virus transfer is low before the symptoms appear.
The "EDC" Center has announced that despite the presence of the disease transfer mechanism, each person usually has two or three people.
In particular, the virus survives at 99% over four hours for one day on plastic (Piproplan) and anti-alter steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on copper 99% survives for maximum of four hours.
Of course, it depends on the temperature and the temperature.
The right use of soap and laundry is also effective. The soap products take away the layer of virus fat, disable it, and beat it from skin and from other levels.
Other solutions, such as the cycloquisium and the cyclicin glucans, are less effective. In the study in Hong Kong, the molecular samples were taken on average two days after the hospital began.
In five patients from six patients, he first showed the highest sample of the virus, and on the sixth day of the virus, the highest virus was seen in the second day's testing.
The CARS-CoV-2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new form of severe breathing syndrome, which was first taken from three people with the larvasis and associated with the group of severe breathing diseases in the Wuhan.
All new symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are seen in the related chromosis.
The virus will be destroyed outside the human body with home soap. The bubble soap will destroy it. SARS-CoV-2 has a direct connection to SARS-CoVV.
Coved-19 affects the maximum effect on the lungs because the virus is entering into the host cell through angitin (AE2), which is in the bubble cells of the type of lungs.
The virus uses a certain surface gluquitin, "Speke" to connect to AE2 and enter the host's cell.
A severe heart damage was seen in 12% infected people at the Wuhan Hospital.
The rate of heart-intensive symptoms due to the reaction of fluids and immune systems is high in the process of development, but severe damage may also be related to ACE2 receivers in the heart.
The ACE2 receivers are in the heart and are involved in the heart activity.
The high rate of terbomosis (31%) and the erobolism (25%) has been seen in the IU patients with COU infection, and may be related to a weakness of diagnosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to cover cells with AE2 in a breathing channel, severe systemic infections have been seen in patients with COD-19.
In particular, TSM-SIF cells have been proven to be associated with amphithphic monosymistitis IL-6 and severe lung pathology in Coveid-19 patients.
It is also reported as an autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard recognition method is a chain reaction to the removation of the moment (RRR-CR).
This experiment usually works on breathing samples that are found with the symbillinex, of course, as well as the gytomology.
The results usually prepare for two days in a few hours.
Blood tests can also be used, but this requires taking two blood samples at a time distance of two weeks. In this case, the test does not have much value directly.
Chinese scientists were able to separate and publish a species of corrosus and release its genetic sequence.
By April 4, 2020, the clinical experiments (which is capable of detecting active infections and personal history) were in the hands of the study, but were not used very often.
This experience is only 60 to 70% in China's field of testing.
In the United States, FPD confirmed the first surveillance test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month.
A multi-lebole glass is used with a side distribution, non-intensive and inconsistent to detect the early stages of infection.
==Prequents==Integration of substance, molecular cover (rescuing a blade with a bubble variable) and hardnessing may indicate the progress of the disease.
There's not much information about microbiology damages and coved-19.
The most important Pathological findings in autopsy are:
MX: Alterial nature, pericardy, heart failure and breathing.
There are four levels of super-symmmphism of a virus that can be observed:
E.L.I.E.L.L.E. is a breathing person, he's a proplyphosis, a massive chromatitis, a massive epochitis, angititis, and a large multi-cell structure.
The severe oscillation: scattered bubble damage (DAD) with scattered bubble pollution.
DAD is the cause of a severe breathing disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxium.
E.R.I.E.L.I.E.L.E.L.E.P.E.P.P.E.P.P.
Blood: the clotting in a scattered artery.
In order to reduce the possibility of infection, an infection can be mentioned to stay at home, avoid being present in busy places, washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, maintaining breathing and avoid touching an eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC offers mouth and noses with paper tissue during coughing and coughing and using the inner part of the elbow, if not provided.
Child health care is strongly recommended after coughing.
CDC's use of fabric masks in public places has suggested somewhat, to prevent disease from spreading by non-signed people are following down social approach to large groups by shutting down schools and workplaces, limiting travel and large reunions.
The distance instructions include at least six feet (1.8 meters) between individuals.
There's no effective drug for preventing the disease from COD-19.
CDC also suggests that people wash their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water.
CDC also recommends the use of the alcohol anti-symbillist with alcohol content at least 60% if there's no water or soap available. For areas where normal washings are not available, WHO has offered two formulas to local production.
In these formulas, an anti-merobic factor is obtained from Ethanol or ISOpropanol.
In order to remove the microglytes of alcohol, the hydrogen peroxide is used; this is not an active material to counter the hand.
The glyserol is added as a continuity shield.
People with supported care are managed to include liquid-intensive fluid, oxygen support and other vital organs.
CDC suggests that people who are suspicious of infection use simple mask.
It is used to deal with the condition of breathing failure, but its benefits are still in check.
Personal health is offered to maintain safety and change in life style and family diet.
Supportal treatments may be useful to people in early stages of infection.
Special care experts and lung experts in the United States have gathered various institutions as a free source of IBCC.
Until April 2020, there's no particular treatment for Koved-19.
In order to fix the symptoms, some medical experts have recognized the use of pstaminel (staminen) to use the first line better than Iboproffin.
It is necessary to minimumize the possibility of virus transmission, especially in treatment places where floating particles are performed, such as pipe or manual air.
For health experts who care for people with COD-19, CDC offers protection in the "AIR" quarantine room and standard precautions, preventing contact and air care measures. CDC has published instructions for personal protection equipment (PE) during this period.
The proposals are: Gun PE, the mask or face mask, the eye shield and the surgical gloves. If it is, the use of the mask is priority.
The N95 breathing mask has been confirmed for industrial environments, but the FBI has allowed use of the mask with "EUA" (EUA).
This mask is designed to protect air particles such as dust, but it is not guaranteed against specific biological factors to use outside the main application.
If the mask is not available, CDC recommends the use of facial shield, or as the last solution, the hand-hand mask.
Most cases of Coved-19 are not so severe that it requires the use of mechanical air or alternative methods, but a percentage of them needs these actions.
The type of breathing support for people with breathing failures is in the hands of the coved-19 people.
Whether each of these two methods leads to similar benefits in sad patients, it's not yet known.
Some doctors would prefer to use an insurgent mechanical air, because this way limits the amount of micro-mass persimmonization compared to the persimmonal continuity of current currents. There's a much more extreme spread (people over 60 years old, and especially over 80 years).
In many developed countries the head of the hospital bed is not enough. As a result, the health system's capacity is limited to manage the sudden increase in severe cases to the Kwaid-19 hospital.
In a study in China, it turns out that 5% of the patients are hospitalized in special care, 2.3% require mechanical air and 1.4% die.
In China, about 30% of the people who are hospitalized due to the disease of CO2-19 are eventually taken care of in the IU.
Mechanical airway is more complex because the syndrome of hypertension (ARDS) in Coved-19 is increasing and oxygen is much more difficult.
In order to measure the oxygen, and entangle the probability of lung damage associated with the air and chest, it is essential to use the airer with high pressure control and PEP control modes.
Old weather machines may not have high PEP.
The study of possible treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are at a clinical level.
It appears that remsvier is the most promising among the drugs.
Although the development of new medicines will take up to 2021, several of the trials that have already been confirmed for other subjects or are advanced in the process of testing.
Antivirus medication may be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO has suggested that volunteers take part in the possible medical and medical trials of the United States. The FPD has granted a temporary permit treatment for plasma use; however, in cases where the person's life is severely or completely in danger.
The drug did not have to conduct clinical studies to prove the effect and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China revealed a mobile phone program to manage the process of disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and identity number.
This program can identify the nearest contact with surveillance data and identify the possibility of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risk is identified, the program will report the matter to local health authorities in addition to offering a domestic quarantine offer. It has been used to analyze a lot of data on the mobile phone, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people in South Korea and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed mobile phone data to guide people suspicious of Koved-19 to security institutions.
This attempt was made for quarantine and protection of people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Dettsche Tillkom provided phone location data to Robert Kok, from the German federal institutions to provide research on the process of virus spread and prevent it.
Russia used facial recognition technology to identify quarantined persons.
Gulio Gollra, a local health officer of Italy, has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people continue to travel freely".
The German government held 48 hours a weekend with more than 42.000 people.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, president of the Republic of Allah, called to attract creative methods of preventing the spread of Cronos.
The quarantine, travel limit, side effects or fear of infection may cause people to get involved.
The BBC quotes that the increase in social separation, loneliness, concern for health, mental pressure and economic problems can change people's mental and physical health.
The disease may be rare or lack of symptoms in some stages, and the effects such as other common disease affects the hyper-symmmorphism, such as coldness.
A mild case usually improves within two weeks, but people with severe or severe illness may take three to six weeks.
According to other virus data, such as Sarus and Mors, pregnant women may be one of the most dangerous groups in Coved-19; of course, there's not much information about Koved-19.
In sad people, CO2-19 may quickly be transformed into an acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and resulting in a lack of breath failure, infection, or multi-information disorder.
It is possible to refer to infections, blood disease and heart failure, kidney and liver failure.
Blood failures, especially the increase in protembin's time, have been seen in six percent of people who had been hospitalized due to the disease of CO2-19.
At approximately 20–30% of people with CO2-19 have seen signs of the increase in liver infection (the aminos of aminos).
According to the same report, the average time between the appearance of symptoms and death has been ten days when five days are related to the hospital.
Of course, the patient was transferred to the IU average of time between the hospital and the death of seven days.
A recent review shows that the average time between the initial symptoms has been between 14 days and 14 deaths, which has been reported to be a full range of six to 41 days.
The National Health Committee (NHC) showed that men's death rate was 2.8% and women were 1.7%.
The tissue-information of the dead lung samples indicate that the damage to the separated bubble and cell chromatosis in both the lungs.
There has been a virus's genetic changes in the penotops.
The lung image was similar to the lung image with a severe breathing syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of the death cases mentioned in the Chinese National Health Committee, the increase in terponin or heart attack caused a heart damage.
According to March, 89% of those in the hospital had already been ill; medical resources and local social status also affects the rate of casualties.
The estimate of the casualties caused by the disease is variable due to local differences, as well as the problems of the pathology.
A small number of cases may result in over-extensive loss rate.
However, the fact that death cases have been the result of earlier diseases may mean that the current death rate has been underestimated.
The smoking people, compared to non-sigar people, are likely to be hit by 1.4 times as severe as the Koved-19 symptoms and are likely to need 2.4 times special care or diet.
In the "Fong Hospitals Department" report, a decrease of 20 percent to 30 percent of the lung capacity in some people who have been healed from disease and the signs of organ damage in the lung scan.
The situation may lead to a P-P-P-P-C-C-C-C-F-P-P-E-P.
By March 2020, it was not clear if history caused effective immunity in people who were cured of this disease.
In some cases, the result of the test on Cronorus has been positive in people who have been healed from Coveid-19.
It is believed that these cases are caused by an infection and not again with infection.
It is thought to be a natural virus with animal origins through the infection.
The real origin is unknown, but until December 2019, the infection was almost entirely based on human transfer to human beings.
In January 2020, the first case of the sign came back to December 1, 2019, which was published in January 2020.
The official WHO journals in the history of the first instances have announced signs coming on December 8, 2019.
In order to measure the death rate, different standards are usually used.
These numbers are changed in the region and in time, and are affected by the amount of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the early process and population properties such as age, gender and general health.
In the late 2019s, WHO dedicated the ICD-10 emergency codes to the death of the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the lab and U7.22 for the death of Coveid-192 or all of the founding infections of SARS-CoV-2 in the lab.
According to John Williams University statistics, by April 17, 2020, the world rate of 6.9% casualties (153, 82222, 240, 191).
This number is different in each region. The other scales can be referred to as the death rate (CFR) that defines the percentage of people who die of disease.
It's not limited to time, and it follows a certain population from the stage of infection to the case closed.
However, all infected people don't necessarily produce enzymes, there may be information on the number of infected people.
In the small village of 4600 people, Cestiglione d'Ada, the virus spread center in Italy, 80 tons (1.7%).
In Ginglet, this disease spread from Carnival festivals. The infection of young people led to a relatively low death rate.
In addition, the German health system has maintained its performance.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, according to blood donors' assessment, may have produced occupants.
(0.004% of the population) has been confirmed by Coveid-19.
Its effect is different between men and men and women.
In Chinese and Italy studies, the death rate has been announced in higher men.
It's the highest possibility of men in older than 50.
In China, the rate of death was 2.8% for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reason for this difference is not known, but genetic factors and behavior may affect it.
In the early years, sexual security differences, less deformation of smoking among women, and more men's disease, such as hypertensive blood pressure, may play a role in increasing the rate of loss in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were dead and 72% of those who died of Koved-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did no action to track data related to gender infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Abula, HIV, flu and Sars have a different effect on men and women.
A higher percentage of the treatment box, especially nurses, are female, and their probability of being exposed to the virus is higher.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that Koveid-19 was elected as the official name of the disease.
Tdredos Adhanum Gheberys, Chief WHO, announced that COC, C.I., V., was related to virus, D, and 19 times its initial identity: December 31, 2019.
The name is chosen to prevent reference to specific polar locations (such as China), animal species or group groups, based on international suggestions, and to prevent women's label from doing so.
WHO also uses the title "Vorus Coved-19" and "WHO" in formal communication.
The disease and the virus are common in the name of "Curnovirus".
In the early stages of the spread of disease in Wuhan, China, the name "Curnorus" and "Curnorus Wuhan" were shared in the virus and disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization of 2019-NCov and extreme breathing disease considered the temporary names of this disease.
The official names of Koved-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of the capacity ratios in standard supply chains, some digital producers are planning to produce health care, such as the symbiology and the airworks.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital needed a back-of-the-the-the-air vent, and the producer couldn't get it on time. So a local elevator took a reverse engineering and a 100 o'clock production.
After the early stages of Coveid-19 spread, conspiracy theories, misinformation information and lack of information about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease were formed immediately online.
This virus seems to be transferred from humans to some animals.
The study has not been affected by the evidence of a virus in pig, duck, and chicken.
No drug or vaccine has been confirmed to treat this disease.
International research is going on about vaccines and drugs between government organizations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization carried out the "invest Health Organization" in order to evaluate the treatment of four anti-vius compounds that hope most.
There's still no vaccine, but different active institutions are investigating the proposal vaccines.
The previous results of SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receivers to enter human cells.
There are three ways to do research.
First, researchers are looking for a full virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, disabled or dead, is intended to prevent the immune reaction in the human body from using the new CO2-19 infection.
A second strategy is followed by the purpose of a vaccine that can make the immune system sensitive to some part of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is based on S-S-S protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2.
The third approach is related to nuclelic acid vaccines (or DNA vaccines, new way of providing vaccines).
The test vaccines of each of these methods should be examined safely and effective. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of vaccines began with four volunteers in Seattle.
This vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that has been copied from the virus of the disease.
By April 2020, there were over 300 active clinical experiments.
Seven clinical experiments evaluated the treatments that had been approved for the treatment of occupants that could be referred to four research plans about hydroxyclorkin or clarokin.
Anti-Vorus drugs require the application of most Chinese research, which is to be announced as a result of nine phase tests of remsvire in several countries until the end of April.
By April 2020, the dynamic analysis of the Covide–19 vaccine vaccine development was going on.
By March 2020, there were non-recent evidence of remsvire effect.
It was seen in patients who were treated with non-remsvier without permission.
It's going on in the United States, China and Italy.
Of course, the community of researchers has been invited to cash these results.
Korea and China health institutions have suggested use of the Clerovkin.
However, the Wuhan virus Institute, while offering daily use of a heat, has announced that the dose is twice as dangerous as possible and may be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FPD granted the emergency use of hydrochlorukin and Clerockin, as well as the treatment of doctors with CO2-19.
Basic data shows that high dose removin's use is essential for preventing SARS-CoV-2 in the lab environment.
After the low concentration effect was proved in preventing SARS-CoV-2 removing, it was suggested for research in the human body. The research shows that preparing the first SISP protein with the protégnosis 2 (TPPSSSS-CoV-2) is required to interact with the AE2 receiver.
The study of Clerukin and hydrochlorickin with/no Ostemin has major limitations that prevent medical society from accepting without checking these treatments. Osliumir doesn't prevent the disservation in the lab environment of SARS-CVV-2 and is not proven in the care of Coveid-192.
The Cytokin storm may be a result of the following critical stages of the Cytokin.
The evidence shows that the hydroxy cytokin has the opposite properties of the Cytkin storm.
After the use of this drug placed positive results in severe diseases in Italy, he was subjected to a national level-level test in Italy.
It is used to identify the cytokin storm, which is the cause of the death of some infected people.
The FBI confirmed the Interlockine-6 receiver based on previous studies for treatment of the Cytokin's immune syndrome, which was created for some other reason, the CART treatment cell was created in 2017.
Until today, random evidence and controlled have not been provided by the effect of autism to treat CRS.
The transfer of pure, dense, and densely-resolved enzymes produced in the immune system of better people from Kovaid-19 to the needy as a non-integration method.
The strategy was tested for Sarus, and the results were not certain.
===SARS-CoV-2===A possible virus-symmpathization is the operation based on which the SARS-CoV-2 resilience provides defenses against SARS-CV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as cytotoxy City, may be effective or/or phygosytosis.
Other kinds of disabled treatments, such as using artificial monoloonal enzymes, are in the hands of the investigation.
The production of occupants, which include the blood blood flows from the improved people and has specific enzymes of this virus, may increase faster for development.
The disease caused by Cronos, a group of closely related syndromes.
Lee Vaniang, a doctor at the Wahan Central Hospital, who later died of a debilitation of Koved-19 and after public information about the spread of the virus.
