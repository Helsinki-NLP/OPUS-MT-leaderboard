In modern ice skis, the blade has double edges where there's an anal hat.
Because the lower part of the blade has bent a little bit, as the blade turns around one side or another, the edge that's connected with the ice has bent.

In order to return to their previous energy level, they must destroy the extra energy received from it.
They do this by spreading light and small particles called "footon."
The scientists call this process "residentization of radiation," because the automems are motivated by intense light, spreading photons and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows the release of photons. The images are actually much smaller than the picture.
The photons are even smaller than the ones they build.
After hundreds of hours of work, the string in the light finally blows and the light doesn't work anymore.
The light must be changed. When the lights are installed, you must be careful.
First you have to turn off the light switch or split the Kable.
This is because the power can be touched by the location of the light metal, if the inner touch is silent or the light metal base while it is still silent.

Zoom's lens failure is that the central complexity and the number of its lens elements are required to access a limited range of central spaces much larger than the perm lens.
Because the lens producers reach higher standards in the production of the lens, this position becomes smaller.
