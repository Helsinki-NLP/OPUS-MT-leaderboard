Why did these signs exist for so long?
And all the pain in the warden's cage must be fulfilled, especially at your age.
And with the fever.
and your blood pressure and analyssis must continue to be checked
And do you have the back cage pain now?
And do you now have this cage pain?
and besides, are you having trouble breathing?
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides that?
and how long has your fever been
And I'll cough.
And I have a little cough and cough.
And today I'm really in a lot of pain in my top cage.
And is it now the right time for your reincilitation?
And it causes the pain of the cage.
And I think I have some fever.
And I want you to describe the situation of the superior pain.
And they have some fever.
And with your history of diabetes,
And, you know, it's like my superiors are gonna blow.
And you know people always cough on me.
And your top cage hurts.
and you said it was the pressure on your superiors.
A family member of the family has a heart turn, heart disease, heart attack, long blood pressure.
What other symptoms or problems have you noticed with pain?
Are other people like you at home sick with your same symptoms?
Which other symptoms do you have?
Do You Have A Timeful Breathe?
Do you still have stomach pain?
Because it's the flu season.
Shouldn't we be unaware of the pain of the cage with the heart source?
but the more important problem is now the pain in the back shelf.
But I have trouble breathing.
But I know that many people notice me.
But we have to take every pain in the cage with the truth.
But now she's breathing well, right?
I completely forgot because of this cage pain.
You feel like someone's pushing your superiors.
You're still in pain.
Are they suffering from the disease with the same symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic problems like blood pressure or similar problems?
Do you have any other chronic illness like diabetes?
Do you have any heavy breaths with this cage pain?
Do you have blood pressure?
Do you breathe with it?
Do you know what signs he had?
See the image?
Drink a lot of liquids today.
And yet, I'll do diabetes tests.
yet he has all kinds of symptoms like me
how long is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
if your fever was still long,
If your fever is one hundred and two, or higher.
if you think your symptoms or problems require a better check
I got fevered yesterday.
I have a short fever.
I got fevered yesterday.
I've got a lot of pain here in the top cage.
I'm the subject of the breathing problem.
i'll send you an image
I feel pain at the top today.
i have a little headache and fever today
I think it's flu.
I think it's a mild flu.
is it like a heavy and heavy person sitting on your top?
It all started with headaches and fever almost at the same time.
It's right in the middle of my top.
The pressure is like the back cage pain.
The pain is at my top.
It's in the middle of my top.
It's in the middle of my top.
My cage hurts.
I'm very worried about this cage pain.
i want you to tell me when you describe this pain in the top cage
Like blood pressure or diabetes.
It's right in the middle of my top.
Now she's been on the Takipireina sweet fever. You can.
Okay, Mary, you had these symptoms for days.
Now you said you've got top cage pain.
Sometimes I'm in the back cage pain.
ok, do you have other symptoms besides pain
Or is someone sitting on your top?
fever and cough, headaches and pain, almost that's all.
It's right in the middle of my top.
In this image, show me where you feel pain.
since you have a fever
So you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of the same symptoms?
tell me about the pain of your superior cage
The fever goes up at night.
The fever I've had two days ago.
Last night was a fever.
It's Dr. Porter at the center of the Imerj room.
Well, can you say a little bit more in the bond with the pain of your superior cage?
Well, I feel pain in front of my body in the top cage.
Well, I've had a severe pain in my top cage for a while.
All right, when I have this pain in the top cage,
What kind of pain do you have in your superior cage?
When did this cage pain start?
In which part do you feel pain?
Where do you feel this superior pain?
You're feeling hard on the top cage.
You know, I'm allergic to diabetes and other problems.
you said you had this pain in the top cage.
The growing population of the Coronios disease (COVID-19) quickly in the European Union/OP and the United Kingdom, from 1 Genori to March 15, 2020.
In the United States of Europe and the U.K., it shows that although the disease is different in different countries, it is still growing at a speed of 19 in all countries.
According to the experience given from the disease in Italy, countries, kitchens, and special care entrances, they must increase their preparation for the large wave of the Kwaid–19 patients who will need specific health services and special care services.
On 31st Dember 2020, one of Penomoni's patients was reported for an unknown reason in Wuhan, China's Hubi province.
On 9 Genuri 2020, the Central Center of China's disease reported that the disease, which is a new virus, is then referred to as the severe chroma-CV-2, or "SARS-CV-2" (SARS-CV2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called the Cronos disease (COVID-19).
By this moment, the evidence suggests that about 80 percent of the spinal cord has been used as COVID-19 disease is rarely expressed in a breathing channel with or without a pronounity, and most of the spinal cord are healed.
About 14% of the spinal cord, Coved-19 became a more powerful disease that patients found to be hospitalized, while 6% of the spinal cord were being taken into special care care.
The death rate of patients who have been put in bed due to Koved-19%.
In this study, we have evaluated the flows of Coveid-19 in each European/Emnival country of Europe and the United Kingdom and compare this process into the Hubi region of China.
We continue to compare the current number of Koveid-19 in European/Ninciple European and England with Manton's spine in Italy during the 31st period of January 1520.
Koveid-19 patients in the European Union/Nation of Europe and England
After China, Koved-19 spread to more remote areas, and the dynamics of Podmide-19 in other parts of the world are now following the same process in this country.
On March 11th, the Secretary of the World Organization announced that Podmi Koveid-19 was the leader of the entire world.
On March 5, 2020, Spitri and his colleagues reported that the first European patient was the right world organization, according to the definition of the global organization.
In the European Union, the first confirmed patients were reported to be born on 24 Genuri 2020 by France among returning passengers from Wuhan, China's Hubi province.
All of March 15, 2020 in all 30 European/UK/UK countries (UK) was diagnosed as a result of the history of 31 amber 2019 to the end of the date, 39.8 of Mantan and 1.7 deaths were reported by Italy alone.
receive a population number of people who are sick of Koved-19
At the center of the Central Center of Europe's disease (EDC), the number of patients in Coveid-19 has been confirmed in every country, all day from official sources, such as the Ministry of Right, national authorities and logic of the United States, and the World Organization of Rights (ECC), and at 8.00 a.00 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate the flows of Koveid-19 in the European Union/Nation of Europe and England and compare them to Italy.
==History==The basic basis to determine the active cortex of Koved-19, we calculated a period of 14 days cut off for the patients of Koved-19, so the natural period of Koved-19, in every European/Ninformation country of Europe and England, was taken into account at the age of 1 January 1520.
The number of patients in each country was also compared to the number of patients in each country by 8.00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, during the 31st period of March 15, 2020.
The process of moving to Koveid-19 in the European Union/Nation of Europe and England.
The process was seen in a short gathering of 14 days of Kovaid-19 in the European Union/Emnival countries of Europe and the United Kingdom in a general way that was said in Hubi province (Z).
In general, in the European Union/Emnival countries of Europe and the United Kingdom, Koveid-19 began a gathering of about 21 Foberys, and then around 28 Fryrey 2020 carried out a quick increase.
This was primarily due to the increased number of reports reported from Italy, but all other European/E.R./E.I.S. countries showed similar trends about the Coveid-19 continuity.
The second shape of the Coveid–19 number in the European Union/Nation of the European Union and England with Manton's spine in Italy during the 31st period of January 15th March 2020.
It explained that until 8:00 a.m., March 15, 15 other countries reported the total of the given spinal cord by Italian statistics in 3 weeks or less.
Our results show that the exact number of patients of Koveid-19 in the European Union/Emnival countries of Europe and the United Kingdom has increased quickly.
The process observed during the Coved-19 gathering suggests that the Padmmi spread at a similar speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries experience different stages of disease, there are differences in the relationship with the responses of public officials of countries, and in different countries, different standards for people who are considered to be a confirmation test or a coved–19 test.
In early March 2020, Dakteran reported a situation where about 10 percent of the patients in the Koveid–19 patients needed special care, and the media sources reported that the maximum capacity of kitchens and special care in these areas has already been completed.
Right now, from the European Union/ Economic Area, it is available only in the order of 6% and 1% of the spine, data related to the acceptance of the Kwaid–19 patients in the kitchen and/or into special care (the data has not been shown).
However, they must be gathered in the fashion of the system so that they can be used to support current surveillance data and focus on a number of reported spines and death spines.
A check done in 11–2010 showed a lot of difference in access to special care beds and average care in Europe, so that from 29.2 beds on the sandy to 4.2 beds in Pergall for every 10,000 souls are variable.
This means that these countries have more resources or less than Italy (12.5 beds of special care and Ussar for every 10,000 lives in 11–2010).
The molecular scenarios associated with the balance of the right and right capacity were provided with estimates for every EU/invest European/American member country and the United Kingdom in a link with the vast amount of CO2-19 patients at risk:% beyond the capacity of special care beds in the study of the 6th ECDC risk assessment of the relationship with Coveid-19.
Since the spinal cord has ever been seen in certain areas in the European Union/Enomist countries and in special care care care, it is often provided with knowledge of a logic person, the knowledge of the spinal cord and special care beds must be given by the manner that the domains of the area for a statistical level 2 (NTS-2).
The experience of disease in Italy and current processes in other countries shows that Pondmi Koveid-19 has spread quickly in the European Union/EU/Sincillation of Europe and England.
So countries, kitchens, and special care entrances must prepare themselves to deal with the continuous transfer of SARS-CoV-2 virus and provide the necessary provisions for patients of Koved-19, especially in special care, just as it happened in the region of Italy.
The oath that has been described in recent ECD risk assessments, to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus into a quick, wide approach, and all sides along with the change of view of the limitations to the speed of the electrode, because if necessary, the immediate increase of treatments may not allow the decision-making permissions and the healings to recognize and apply proper responses.
A quick risk assessment also lists the general integrity to cover the impacts of the dissatisfaction.
The countries have a short time opportunity to protect their action and reduce the spread speed of SARS-CoV-2 and thus reduce the pressure on the correct service system.
If you are unable to do so, you may face a wide wave of patients who require special care in other European countries or economic care over the past days or weeks.
The outbreak of Cronodus 2019 (SARS 2-CoV-2) has led to the death of more than 3,000 people in China and other parts of the world, and has led to severe human disasters.
The SARS-CV-2 virus may also be similar to the HARS-CV virus, which was responsible for the creation of Sars in 2003, caused by bats' seed and led to the same symptoms by the same mechanism.
However, Koveid-19 is less severe than Sars, but has more housing and increases older men and women than young people and women.
In response to the increasing number of releases in the link with this recent disease, the conflict is being used to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the link to this subject highly significant research.
We'll present basic knowledge in the link to epidemiology, e.g., virusology, diagnosis, prosecution, prescienties and symptoms of disease.
However, many questions remain unresolved, hope that this study of knowing this dangerous disease will be effective.
The Spring Festival became an unprecedented memory for all China that was asked to stay at home because of an outbreak of a new virus, all holidays and weeks later.
The virus has a high-rescuation with the Correnous (CV) cause of severe hypertension in 2003; therefore, the global organization (WHO) chose the name SARS-CV-2 for it, and the disease associated with it (COSV-19-19-19) was chosen.
It began in Wuhan China, and quickly spread across the country and about five other countries around the world.
Since March 2, 2020, the virus has led to more than 8000 items, the number of patients that have gone beyond 400,000 and more than 3000 have died.
"The World Right World Organization of Coved-19 warned that Koved-19 is an enemy of the number 1 public," and its power is probably more than terrorism.
According to Rob Med's database (httttps jwwww.cnbi.nnh.gnioff/pmd/) in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published in the link to Coved-19, which have been taken from the genetics, epidemiology, e.g., e., e., e.g.
The study considers the progress of research in new and considered fields.
In the possible spinal cord, we will try to compare Coved-19 to Sarus and other disease due to Cronosus, the Middle East Reserum (which was published in 2012).
We're going to talk about what we've learned in connection with disease and pre-requisite, and we're going to continue to discuss a number of vital questions.
The virus was considered a traditional way of killing people, and it's about 15% of common colds.
However, in the past century, we met two times with very human sinuss, SARS-CV and MERS-CoV, which, in a way, caused the early outbreak of disease in China and 2012, and in a short time developed to other countries, caused the disease and death and death.
Thus, Koved-19 is the third period of the Coronaus period in human history.
The oath shown in the form of 1 was reported to the National Right of China on 31 Dhamber 2019 from Wuhan on 31 Dhammber 2019.
The sequence was released seven days later.
On 15 Genuri 2020, the first case was reported in Vanhan.
In the meantime, epidemi spread quickly into neighboring cities, other provinces and countries.
On 20 Genuri, the staff's company was reported in the right and wrong sector, which showed that human transmission to human beings is also possible.
On 23 Genuri, the city of Wuhan of the century was supported, and the public travel to it was stopped and supported.
On 24 Genuri, the first clinical study in transplanting with disease reported that, among 40 certain patients, only 21 cases of direct contact with the Wuhan food market, is the location of the beginning of a disease from an unknown animal source.
In 30 Genuri, the global organization announced that this spread was an emergency globality.
The disease has been published throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world until the report has been made.
Since the situation is moving quickly, the end of the process must be determined.
On 11 F.F. 2020, a study with multiple research centers on 8.86, which included 401 patients of Coved-19 more reliable release than Etttpsium.vimpm.wxin.kk.com/lBXXxxxx2bddA.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has developed people all over the ages, but it has been mostly 65-30 years old.
Almost half (4.7.7%) of the spinal cord was over 50 years old, very few under 20 and only 14 men under 10 years of age.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus makes men (0.3.1 out of 10000) more than women (0.1 out of 10,000).
It was developed as clusters in Hobi and around it.
It took five days (9–2 days) from its beginning.
It is the first day of the year, and is the first day of the year.
The period of time from the beginning to the death was 9.5 days.
The base rate (R<sub>0/sub> was 3.77 (in terms of confidence: 4.05.5.1) and Rxub <0/sub> was a disorder of 4.8.2–2.2.
The number of the spinal cord increased before 23 Genuri 2020, and it matches the increase of travel during the spring festival in China.
The death of patients confirmed by 1.44% (with confidence: 1.6.6.10) and the death rate of all patients was 3.1.1% (with confidence:4.5%).
Three major risk factors for Koved-19 were Gender, age (60 years) or taller (60 years) and extreme penomen.
The Coronaus are a family substrate of large and cover-up virus, containing a single RNA string with meaning.
They are classified in four species, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, among which the Alpha and Beta have created human beings.
The gluquistin spics (SS) cover the SARS-Cov virus, and MERS-CovoV, as well as its embolism receivers, Angitsin 2 (AAE2) and DPPP4 (DP4) are connected to the room's corresis.
A virus is released in the cytosinium; after a virus resusculsation, RNA is created with a cover of glycolustins and protins of nucleotoxides, and then it is then combined with the plasma musculitis, and leads to the release of the new virus.
The first gene sequence was reported at SARS-CoV-2 on 10 Genuri 2020.
The findings have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a new type of Coronios Beta, which has been found from the main location of the spread market in the Hanan food market in Wuhan, with 99.98% similar.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is more similar to the SARS-CoV virus compared to the MARS-CV.
==SARS-CoV-2==The seed of the study was found in the super-symbillium of the human air.
AE2 is a human being known as the SARS-CoV-2 virus receiver, and is still known as SARS-CoV.
In addition, the SARS-Cov-2 virus has a weaker connection to the ACE2 receiver than the SARS-CV-2 virus, which matches the fact that the SARS-CV-2 virus creates a weaker disease compared to the SARS-CVVV virus.
SARS-CoV-2 also generates a new short protein that has been planted by eitherf3b and an orf8.
Protein orf3b is the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the character of the Roman virus and prevents IFNT (inferon Beta), although it does not contain either the second or the known motif.
In 18Freuri 2020, Zu and Creo-Microo's co-operator ACE2 were reported to be a human receiver with resolvation 2.9 in Campbelli, along with an amino acid carrier named B0AT1.
They realized that the superflux, which has open and closed connects to an open and closed connectr, and that AE2-BAT1 can be connected to two proteins S, which can be used by a standard for detecting and pollution.
B0AT1 may become a target for a cure for a cure for a cure for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Source and interface host
It turns out that the SARS-CV virus and MERS-CoV were both sourced from bats, and, in order, Sun Zabad and camels were transferred to humans.
==Presolation==The Philosic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to other Crovenus, bats were introduced to the main host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus was 96% similar to the two Cronosics Sars -- such as bats-SL-CVX 45 and Bat-S-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-ZZZZX-ZX-ZX-ZX-ZX-ZX-WX-WX-WX-W-W-21-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-21-W-W-21-21-W-W-21-W-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-21-W-21-21-21-W-W-21-W-21-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-W-W-D-W-W-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-21-D-D-D--2.
However, which host of interfaces has helped create a type of virus in the light of light, is unknown, and the transport path must be clearly determined.
Jay and his colleagues suggested that the snakes were human beings by noise in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Goongji, China suggested that the Pagulins -- the large ants with the long shell -- often used in traditional Chinese medicine, based on the acidic amorphism with a chromatism discovered in the Palogins and the SARS-CV-2 virus, are the possible host of SARS-CV-2 virus.
However, the difference between two genres is a huge difference; therefore, it is expected that certain results will be presented for evidence (e.g.
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are very unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive 48 hours in a dry environment, and this period is less than 20 degrees of centigrade and is 50% of a day.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may have similar qualities.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the spinal cord that disabled the virus effectively: the radiation can be placed at 56-foot temperature; Etret, Ethanol.
In general, all human souls are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore sensitive to the new virus.
In which study is not reported to the exact style study, the ionological response to SARS-CoV-2 is now reported.
So we can only refer previous studies to other corross, especially SARS-CV and MERS-CoV (the form of 4).
The general treatment of the virus after the attack on the host's body is first identified by the natural system of pattern recognition (PRRS) including the Night-C-C-stressing receiver (TLR), the Night-UD receiver (NLR), and the IRR-RI receiver (RRRR).
The virus of various ways, such as the expression of physive factors, the growing growth of dendretives and Stretins of the IFNs, which limit the spread of the virus and faster the anti-viral antigens.
In addition, the N-CV protein can help save the virus from the responses of the system.
The adaptive exemption will soon take place in order to deal with the virus.
The T-spells include "T" stones from CD4 </sup> and CD8 <_sup>> < </sup>> </sup> </sup>> for the defense.
T-C4 <sup> </sup>(sup>_sup> induces rockes B to provoke specific virus anti-spells, and T-C8-sup < </sup>/sup> rocks directly take away the human rocks directly to the virus.
T-rescuiting web sites are producing sterility for aiding the rocks in defense.
However, the Coronaus can be prevented by the inspiration of the Apoptosis of the T room functions.
Blood-resolation consists of celluls from C3A and C5a, and anti-viruss have a viral virus in the face of Antan Roll.
For example, the anti-frequency of a patient recovered from a patient, disarmed the MERS-CV.
On the other hand, the extreme reaction of the methodal system is to produce a large amount of freedom of the position that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, the lack of multiple organs and even deaths.
The probability is that SARS-CoV-2, which is a branch of its properties, is more likely to be caused by disease and more pregnant women.
It is natural that people who are placed in a large number of viruss or people whose exemption functions are faulty, Chans Mats have a higher problem than others.
It was the early study of the first 425 patients in Wuhan that showed that this period was mostly 3–7 days.
However, the study was done on 199 patients, showing that the period of communism was three days and in total from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, mentioned above, has been based on the study of 8.86 patients, the period of a coma, 4.8 (7.2.3.0).
It is important for the authorities to apply the effective period of the century based on the correctest period of the Camon to prevent the virus transfer to others by the spine, but without a mark.
A public procedure, people located in a virus or mantan, must be expedient for 14 days.
Should the period of the century increase to 24 days?
It is often the primary sign fever of Coved-19 that may appear alone, or may be associated with other symptoms such as dry cough, fatigue, pain, headache, headache, throat pain, chest pain, Allah's heart pain, i.e.
Some patients were tissueized once a week after the disease began.
In severe spines, signs of hypertension, suicide shock, amphithic acid, and blood disorder were seen in patients.
Patients of fever or/or breathing symptoms and acute fever, even if they are indisposed in lung images, must be determined by the immediate diagnosis of the virus.
A molecular study in late September 2019 showed the percent of the symptoms seen in patients were in the following article: 98% of fever, 98% of dry coughs, 3,000 breaths and 3% of diabetes; 8% of patients needed help in the air.
The same findings have been reported in the last two studies on a family branch and a branch by the transfer of the seedless people.
As a comparison, a demology study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients were also fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and fatigue breathing (5%) were the main symptoms of disease.
However, 80 percent of them needed help breathing, which was much higher than the Kyid-19 patients, and was more likely to match the speed rate of "Mres" compared to the Coved-19s.
It was also seen in the patients of the Morsis disease (26%) and the throat.
In Sares' patient patients, it turns out that the major symptoms of the fever (99%) containing 99% of the fever, dry cough (2%) (1.1%), short breath (40 to 4%) (20%), diabetes (20%) and throat (20%) were necessary to breathe about 1.1% to 20% of the patients.
;Eli 14 February, when the spinal cord confirmed across the world reached 667 people, the death rate of Vermi Koveid-19 was equivalent to 2% worldwide.
For comparison, the death rate of the Sarmas, Ali Nomber, 2002, was confirmed by 10% of the patient.
In the case of Cyrus, based on a molecular study in June 2012, the death rate of the death rate was about 239% of the patient's death rate.
A previous study reported that <i>R/i> <i> <go> <go> <go> <go> <go>>_sub> The SARS-CoV-2 virus was long and equal to 6.7 with confidence distance (CI) 7.1.1.1.1.1 while the virus was equal to 7.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3, while the virus was only 2–4.
The comparison of SARS-CV-2 is presented with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in connection with symptoms, death, and <i> r/i> <i> <i> <go> <go>> < <go>>> < <0/i>>>>/sub> in table 1.
High numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to publish more than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoVV, but the death numbers are less than these two items.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is much more challenging than MERS-CVV and SARS-CoVV.
The spikes are often started within a family or community or unit vehicle such as a yacht.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other areas of Manhattan or were in contact with mentan or patients within two weeks of the beginning.
However, it has been reported that people can have more than two weeks of the virus without having any symptoms in the body, and they may have improved patients from the treatment of the cure, which have led to a warning to increase the period of cornea.
In the early stages, the number of white environments (for example, lyphitis) is in normal patients or insulation.
For example, Lemphapini, along with the number of white blood cells less than 10 = 10 = 9/sup> 4x4, included the number of lisp <10> = 0.sup>1 and the increase in aminostrates of amortosis in the Vämmy-Mormia.
The levels of liver and amorphinism and mioglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and Protein C responded and the sedimentation of the rytology in the blood of most patients.
In the patient's spinal cord, D-dimer's surface, which is the product of deformation in the blood, went up and reduced the number of liffitis.
In the chest, it is found in most of the COVID-19 patients, including the shadow of the piece of glass or glass dust in the lungs.
Patients are often treated with non-servable pneumony, severe lung damage, and extreme breathing syndrome (ARDS).
When a hypertensive resertosis occurs, unservation of the dissatisfaction, fluids and preservation, it is difficult to exchange breathing gass extremely difficult.
It reduces the type of one and two levels of surprise, and therefore the surface tension goes up, which reduces the ability of the lungs to the Athesse itself and takes the risk of the lungs.
Thus, the worst found found in the chest of the chest was consistent with the severest degree of disease.
In 18F, 2020, the first ptology analysis of the Coveid–19 symptoms introduced the following: the re-movation of the Riotums, the form of clear occupants, the physis, and the observation of multi-symbisal sinics in the lungs of the dead patients, the symptoms that match the antigentology (ARDS) and the symptoms were similar to the disease.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus diagnosis has been performed by the original standard standard for diagnosis of COS-CV-2.
However, due to the high false negative rate that may cause hyperbolism, since 13Frey 2020 in China, they began to use clinical protests to detect disease (a diagnosis that is no longer just depending on 1-CR).
There was a similar situation regarding the diagnosis of Sarus.
Thus, a combination of history of disease, clinical demonstrations, lab tests and radioological findings are necessary to detect effective, necessary, and necessary.
On 14 FBrey 2020, the HHERLOK group introduced the CISPR use protocol to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, during which the artificial parts of the SARS-CV2 virus are identified in the volume of <sup> 18-sup-sup> 20-sup, 10-sup/sp> to <sup/sp> 10/sp> 0–10 mmmm/mmmmmm/mmm/mmmmmmmmmmmm/mmmm/mmmmmm/mm/pmmm/pmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmcmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmcccmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccctmmcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccct.cct.ct.ccccccccttt.ct.ct.ct.ct.ccccccccccccccccccccc.c.c.ct.c.c.ct.
It may be possible that if you are confirmed in clinical samples, you can improve your emotional and comfort.
Because of the lack of experience in connection to the new virus, the Dattreans are primarily taking care of CO2-19 patients, while trying to use various pollutants, which were used to process the pre-respiration of the virus from SARS-CRES-CV and other viral diseases (JD2).
These TEDOs include psychological and potential anti-vaviusts with anti-servosis, devi well-intensive system suppressor, steroids, improved patient plasma, drug medicine, and mental support.
It is also recommended for new patients to be treated as a plasma use of better patients.
The drug companies are competing to produce anti Buddy and Voxin against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus in which it is mostly related to the lungs and may be less likely to attack the other expression organs of ACE2 such as the digestion system.
However, the disorder of breathing is the main threat to patients and the cause of death.
Therefore, aid breathing methods are vital to the relief of symptoms and survival of patients' lives, including normal oxygen, long-term oxygen, non-intensive air condition and an aggressive air condition.
Patients who suffer from severe breathing symptoms must be placed under an exponsis of exponsion (EMO) which has been modified by a lung heart reservation, which has already been used as an attempt for heart failure or deadly breathing.
In addition, the survival of electromagnetisms, the resusciption and the secondary shock and the protection of vital organs is also important to the patient of the SARS-CV-2 virus.
It has been proven that the flood of the website in the sick of Sars and Cyrus is due to the extreme reaction of the methodal system.
The storm of the website is the kind of systemic reaction that is specified to release a series of TNFs from TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFN, IFN, IFN, and MC-1.
These websites induce the pervading system's rockes to release many free radicals, which are the main reason for ARDS and dissatisfaction of different organs.
It is necessary to suppress the medhesive system in the storm of the website, especially in severe patients.
The corticosteroids and Tusysomides, which were used by an anti-mata-IL6 anti-I6.
The rest of the method-rescuing approach for the multi-resistant storm is from the "T" command T; IFN-1, IL-1 and TNF; JAK Control; Beltommon, the control of the signal signal on the website 4; and HDAC controls.
The Stredoids were used by the resusctator of the system's high-resistant system in Tedvi Sars with the destination of the injury of an impossibility.
However, the steroids were not useful with long doses to improve severe lung damage in COD-19 and Saros.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially the clots of blood loss that affects the pre-requisite of disease.
However, it has been recommended to use a critical situation by carefully taking care of short-term preservoids with corticosteroids, with low doses of average doses of precipitation for Kyid-19 patients.
When writing this issue, which anti-Vivus is not effective.
However, the injections in the redecreviri, which is a non-equital analog, have been effective in an American patient to COVID-19.
Remsyvir is a new anti-viory that was built by Giled and was originally intended by the Abola and Marburg virus.
Later, it turns out that Remdiscier may also have a effect on the RNA virus, each other's single string, of the Mordes and Sars.
Based on this, Giled gave China this combination to test two clinical trinals on the spine to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the results were completely expected.
In addition, a barurilial, the Alpha Interferon, Luinaor/Retonauir, and Reroviin were also used as a potential appetite for the potential potential of patients of the patient's breathing symptoms.
It can occur after a combination of a combination with Luinaver/Rertonir.
The interactions between this sauce and the rest of the patient must be carefully examined.
The plasma has been recovered from patients and produced antibiotics.
The collection of the blood of patients who recovered from a disease means that other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from disease disease.
In fact, the healed patients often have a relatively high level of anti wind to deal with the Patgen in their blood.
The antibiotics, Imoglobulin (Ig) produced by the Lgs are to fight against the Patgens and other foreign particles that identify unique molecules in the Patgens and disarm them directly.
On this basis, the plasma was gathered from a group of healed patients from Koved-19 and was injected to 10 highly critical patients.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, and they were seen in their blood as a debilitation, viral charge loss, and the recovery of oxygen density.
However, the proposal for this method to use on a large scale before certain treatment methods have not yet been presented requires further confirmation and transparency in the link.
In addition, along with the effects of TEDA, the case with the plasma seed has to be taken into consideration.
For example, anti winds are over-existing the response to immunity, causing the release of the website of the site that may lead to a deadly toxicity.
It is usually low in blood, and means that people with severe disease are very high-intensive.
It is difficult to develop and develop particular antibiotics in time to deal with global electromas.
Thus, the separation of the B occupants has been improved from patients and is more vital and more effective for effective antibiotics against effective virus proteins.
In this way, it is easy to lift up anti wind production.
It has been used in China for thousands of years.
However, its effect depends primarily on a combination of several other than one forum, which depends on the diagnosis of the disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theory.
Most of the effective elements remain unknown or vague because it is difficult to extract and confirm these factors or optimization compounds.
Now, due to the lack of effective and unique treatment for Koved-19, theTCM (old China) has been considered to be one of the main substitutes for patients with mild, medium symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was observed that Shu Fung Jydo and Lani Hoa Qing's TEDWan capsules were effective.
The highest rates of COD-19 patients in several Chinese provinces where traditional Chinese medicine was used for 8% of patients were seen: "Ganol Stu" (193.7), Najingia (50%), and Hanhan (50%), whereas the traditional medicine of China was used only for some% of the people who were ill.
However, this is a very difficult comparison, because many other effective factors, such as the number of patients and the strongness of patients, should be considered.
On 18 Fabreuri 2020, Boeley G. and his colleagues published a study in which they compared T.T.A. with Western medicine (WM) alone with the combination of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They realized that the amount of time needed to restore body temperatures to optimization, remove symptoms and hospitalization in Western medicine group China was less significant than the group was just Western medicine.
It is noted that the disease rate with symptoms (of severe symptoms) for the WM+TCM group (the traditional Chinese+TM) was less than Western medicine (4% vs. 4%.6.2%) and the death rate in the traditional Western medicine group was less than 8% of the Western medicine group (8.8%).
In addition, the traditional mechanical treatment and treatments of the comacan medicine must be evaluated by the seed of the trilolles under the larger scale and at the larger centers.
An effort to determine the function mechanism and determine effective components of traditional Chinese medicine methods, or if possible, a combination of them is interesting and tempting.
The suspicious or confirmed patients of Coveid-19 often experience many of this very contagious and even deadly disease and are still bored, alone and angry.
In addition, the symptoms of antan countol of fever, fever loss and cough and can also be caused by sleep from corticosteroids, anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of Sares' spread, a spectrum of the mental condition of Parish was reported to include constant depression, anxiety, panic attacks, movement debilitating, mental symptoms, disorder, even suicide.
The tracking of the call and the compulsory century can cause stress and guilt in the spine in linking the influence of the family, the sin problem for family and friends.
Thus, mental integrity needs to be taken into the hands of Qyd-19 patients, suspicious people and people who were in contact with them and still, the general people who need these services.
Psychological support should include the formation of several psychological rights teams with multiple expertise, clear information, along with regular news about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the use of electronic devices and application applications for contacting each other.
The most effective vaccines are the essential importance of cutting off a chain of animal and human spinal cord to sensitive hosts, and are often considered anti-resolvation support in the Consulated virus.
An attempt to develop (SARS-CoV) proteins has been designed to generate long-term anti-synthesis with long-term function and powerful insurgence and/or protection against SARS-CoV.
The living vaccines have been tested in animal mombles for Saros.
However, before a clinical study begins, these VVVS candidates must be determined against the dying and their protection against the Zaonuz virus.
This is probably because Sarus was destroyed 17 years ago, and since then which new item has not been reported.
On the other hand, a single spinal cord is seen in the Middle East, and due to the stability of the Zaonuz resources in the native areas to other areas.
Voxination strategy was developed using an disabled virus, DNA submiters, virus, nanosynthetates, chromat particles, and substrates for the mere protins, and were tested in some spines on animal molecular lymals.
The construction of a secure and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-integration individuals is an emergency and vital task for the process's indentible process.
However, due to a long period of time required for design and production (for example, 18 months) and dynamic transformations of the Coronaus, it is challenging to deal with this problem.
The disease has recently begun to present its period of amplification in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are gradually healed without any side effects.
However, like Sarus and Merus, Koved-19 is also associated with severe disease and death in the spinal cord.
Thus, Dizin is a pre-requisite for the disease for the health services of the Ph.D.S. services that are important to put their services first in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies so far, the following factors may affect Koved-19 patients or are associated with this diagnosis (Jedol 3):
Age: The age is the most important factor in the advance of Sars, which is also in connection with Koved-19.
Coved-19 is primarily at 65–30 years old, which was included in one study, including 1866 patients described above, 47.7%.
Patients who needed special care were more likely to suffer from severe diseases and background effects and had more age compared to non-privileged patients (with age 66 against 51) and this suggests that age could be considered an advance factor for the result of the disease of the COD-19 patients.
Gender: As noted above, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased men (0.3000 in 10,000) compared to 0.2000 people.
In the case of the disease, it is possible that patients of the Koveid–19 patients who need special care will be more likely to be injured or heart damage.
Heart problems were the main cause of death in the sick of Sares.
It has been reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been connected to the ACE2-mormies that could lead to liver disorder in Kyid-19 patients.
The age and disease of the background are strong, and they may have a problem with each other.
In the blood, the protein level of reaction C is a reflection of a severe infection or tissue damage, and by the example, a potential diagnosis factor for disease, reaction to end-resolvement and recovery.
It has been suggested that there is a connection between the CRP level and the prerequisite of the Coveid-19.
In addition, increased levels (LDH), aminotranstrates (AAT), aminothrestin aminost (ALT) and CK's micros may also be effective in predicting the outcome.
They are expressed in several tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So, they're traditional branders to detect heart disorder or liver failures.
Original clinical symptoms: For predicting the consequences and effects of Coved-19 you must consider chest removation and the development of clinical symptoms together with other related problems.
The use of stremoids: the oath at the top, the steroids are the causes of deformation of the system, which are usually used as a reliability to support the intensibility of impossibility in the face of suicide disease.
Since the high dose of corticostoids was widely used in severe patients of Sars, many survivors suffered the blood loss of blood loss along with long-term and low quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the steroids must be used with lower doses and short period of time for the patients of Coid-19.
Mental stress: The oath described above, by the prevalence of the Koved-19 patients was overly stressed because they were often forced to observe the long period of the century, doubts and nights in connection with events and witnessed the death of family members or close friends.
The mental advice and long-term support for these patients is essential for stress loss and return to normal life.
According to the study of democracy, Koved-19 has different properties compared to Saris.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to be effective, in addition to substrates, such as other common fluorous chromuss in the hyper-symmmorphics, and in the early stages of infections with mild symptoms or lack of symptoms.
So Menton's patients developed a lot of virus during daily activities, which causes a lot of problems for the electromagnetism.
However, findings show that the transfer of SARS-CoV was done when patients were in severe phase of disease, so most of the transfer spines were not in the early phase.
Thus, the current Coveid-19 is more dangerous and more dangerous than the Saros spread.
There are very good efforts in China, which include the in and out-of-the-the-town and neighboring cities and so forth, almost all of the souls are about to be cut off by the SARS-CoV-2 transfer chain.
However, these actions have damaged the economy and other parts of the country, but the number of new patients is indisposed to be slowed down.
The most popular estimate is that the infection ends by March and the process of analysis takes 3 to 4 months.
And yet, some experts aren't very optimistic.
The estimate of Paul Hunter and his colleagues shows that the obdimentary Coved-19, which is more significant than Sars, does not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and model colleagues designed to predict the result of epidemiism and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could cause two-thirds of the world's lives.
A Canadian group reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in both of the substrates of substrates, and the throat was healed in patients two weeks before the treatment.
However, according to the number of new molecular spines, which means the success of the current strategy is likely to be seen in China, the promising eye of China.
At first it was predicted that Abola had killed half a million people to one million people and killed half a million people.
However, the seed of the first century was eventually infected by the disease of Candol.
It may be similar to SARS-Cov-2, the SARS-CV-2 virus is slowly weaker and eventually disappear or become a less-resolved virus that lives alongside humans.
The comparison of predium Coved-19 was presented at the bottom with Sarus and Cyrus (the form of 5).
SARS-CoV-2 has a high-resolve transmission of cough-or-siling seed, and is likely to be released direct contact to the virus.
The virus was also found in the material that would lift up the possibility of a new transfer from the anti-fumi.
A recent study on 138 patients reported that probably 41% of people were infected by the treatments of the treatment room, including 17 patients of other diseases and 40 of the box.
Thus, to protect humans and especially the right and right-of-the-art employees, social family members, colleagues and even visitors who are sick of Manhattan or those who do not have to take full care of it.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk is to wear face masks; using both kinds of surgical masks and breathing masks N95 will help the spread of viruss.
The surgical masks prevent air transmissions from breathing fluids from a potential resonating spinal cord, or depending on the levels of drugs, and then prevent them from being transferred to others.
However, the cost of the N5-CV2 masks (SARS-CoVVVVS) against the breathing of the 1860s has protected you from 10 to 80 nanometers, an oath that 5% of the Weyrons can be able to support it; the virus is similar to the SARS-CV2 virus, and the size of both is about 800 nanometers.
Since particles have even been shot through five surgical masks, they can provide a direct contact with patients, and they must use N95 masks and avoid wearing surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, the employees of the right and wrong sector must wear fully-resolvedGons to reduce the possibility of contact with the virus.
The virus can still see the person through the eye.
On 22 Genuri 2020, a duck was taken to SARS-CoV-2 while wearing the N95 mask; it may have entered his body.
In this case, regular services providers must also be used when dealing with patients, clear-to-face objects or glasses.
With the destination of public purity in the region of Manhattan or potential pollution, a serious way is to suggest that people wash their hands with anti-servable soaps more often than usual, go on and stay at home and limit their contact with possible people.
The right distance for patients is three feet.
These actions are thought to be effective ways to reduce and continue to prevent the spread of the virus.
However, the SARS-CV-2 virus is known as a new virus for the human world, but its long harmony with SARS-CoVV, reported in 7G20, was a serious warning for China and brought the memory of Sarus' spread in 2003.
However, until 19 J.J. 2020, there was no attempt to create common peace, the day when the head of the center announced that the virus was limited to the ability to reduce and transfer effective human origin to humans, and it is possible to control the disease.
This message made the public warning not very serious, especially when the entire country was preparing for the New Year's Spring Festival, and thus a vital opportunity to prevent the spread of disease on its minimum scale was lost.
In China, ill-adulterator organizations may have been involved in this difficult lesson and are making key changes for future actions.
For example, these organizations have to be more careful when public announcements are given, because whatever they're called, they're going to take care of people, and they can change their views, and they can be more sensitive to non-medicals from clinics, instead of waiting for official reports of surgeons or authorities; (3) to control a potential epidemic in the early stages not to invite people to peace, but to continue to make public public peace, and to continue to improve the public relations with the public.
The prevalence of Koved-19 was created by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, starting at the end of the 2019s.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China, and until the moment it's written around 50 other countries in the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms of Koved-19 and Saros are similar, the prevalence of Koved-19 gave him the idea that Sars had returned.
However, there are several specific differences between Coved-19 and Sars, which are intended to control the epidemi and the patient's treatments of basic importance.
It affects older people and older men more than young people and women, and is still higher than young people than young people.
The death rate of Vermir Sars is greater than Koved-19 (10.9% v. 1.44).
The Kwaved-19 patients also transfer the disease when they have no symptoms, while the Sars disease is usually performed when the disease is very severe, so it is more difficult to prevent the spread of Koved-19 compared with Sars.
This explains why the SARS-CoV-2 virus is much faster and released on a broader scale than SARS-CoV.
In some patients, Coveid-19, the usual RNA test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be associated with negative results.
On the other hand, healed patients can again return to the infected virus.
These findings increase the risk of the spread of the virus in a remarkable way.
In view of this rate of fast progress in research on Coved-19, there are still several vital problems that have not been solved that count as well:
Where's the source of SARS-CoV-2 virus?
However, 96% of the acidic hemulitis was found between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and two bats-serus-sars, we still can't conclude that the source of SARS-CV-2 virus was of bats.
What kind of animal has been an interface to transfer the virus from its original host, the bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions of 1 and 2 we cannot effectively cut off the transfer chain, and the spread may be re-resolved at any time.
However, the milicolation and biochemian evaluations showed that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to the AE2 receiver, but how exactly does the virus enter the air-way rocks and provide the background of the metaological transformations?
Is the virus connected to the observators of AE2 in other organs?
Until these questions are clearly answered, we're not going to be able to achieve the quick, precise diagnosis of disease.
How long will it take?
How does the virus develop during the transfer between people in your body?
Will it become a global walking, like Sars, disappear, or will it spread like the flu of the website?
It is important to find the answer to the question above and many other questions, but it may take some time.
However, regardless of the need, the only option we're going to make is to stop at the moment and bring life back to normal.
The animal origins of human corross.
For thousands of years, Motism and compromise have helped evolution at the same time as the Crovenuss and their hosts, the human count.
Before 2003, two human coronos were known as a rare disease factor, such as normal collapse.
===SARS ===SARS and mid-air breathing syndrome of the Middle East (MRS) have revealed another coin, and has shown the potential risk of a human Antan corrosus.
The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 at Central China in recent 2019, re-recognizing the Cronouss and surprised us with the ability to carry its long transfer, but its blanket ability is less than that of his sister SARS-CVV.
Antan Cronosus humans have an animal origin, and knowledge of the origin of the human sinus can help us well.
Most of the human Cronosis start from bats, which are non-sited blankets.
It is also known as the source of the interface.
The host's animal recognition directly helps with human diseases.
The study of the host's interactions in animals can give us important information about the ability to blankets in humans.
In this review study, we present a general view of the information in the link with the seven available human Cronos, and we focus on the history of their discovery and still the origin of animals and the transfer between species.
Most importantly, we compare and oppose different human sinos from the evolution of the virus and the noise of the Janeums.
The following 2019 (coved-19) disease is discussed in the cycic.
In addition, the conditions needed to move successful between hosts and turn away the evolution of the virus are also becoming the focus of attention.
The Coronavieridae is a species of RNA virus covered by so-called mono-mormation.
"These virus, which has the largest Janeum 26, 32Ks in the RNA virus, were called "CVs" or "CVs" or "Kerovous virus".
The structureal idol, the Cronouss, has a single piece of gas that has a similar organization.
About two thirds of Jinium, two chocats are still covered (ORFA and OF1b), which are translated into PP1 and pp1b.
Proteins are made to produce 16 non-information proteins called nsp1-16 rather than 16.
Protein is the remaining Gineium of the EFs for structure proteins, the number of septics (S), the virus cover (E) and the nucleotin (NN).
A number of specific link-spencins (linege-spencic) proteins are swept by different forms of corona virus.
According to the difference in the protein, the Cronosians are divided into four species (the Alpha Cronosus, Cronocuss Bitas, and the Coronios Delta), and among them the sex of Cronos Baya, consists of the majority of human ions (A, B and D), and is divided into four sub-interves (A, C, C, and D).
Philostinic evidence has shown that bats and birds act as source of the soul, as most of the Alpha Cronosus and the Bitos, while the birds are the main tank of the Kronauros, and the Kronaurus Delta.
For thousands of years, the Cronouss have constantly crossed the barriers between the species and some have appeared as important human blankets.
To this day, seven types of human Cronos have been identified.
Among them is HCoV 229E and HCV-NL63 is the Alpha Coronus.
The five types of occupants include HCoV-COCC, HCV-HKU1, Coronus is the factor of severe breathing syndrome SARS-CoV (MRS-CV) and SARS-CV-2.
HCoV 229E, HCoV-COCCID, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually causes mild symptoms such as normal collapse and/or diabetes.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been identified as a very recently-sympathized blanket, and in more patients it is likely to cause severe breathing conditions, and the probability of creating hypertension syndrome (ARDS) and the outside protests are very high.
The first HCV-229E, B814, was separated from patients' occupants in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was obtained by taking over the high studies of HCoV 229E and HCV-OCID, both of which created my own self-extensive symptoms.
In fact, until Sarus has spread, this concept was widely accepted that the results of human coronos are generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most destructive examples of the modern age in which more than 8000 people were created and the death rate reached about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiration (MRS) led to an insurgent outbreak in the Republic of Saudi Arabia, and it was really rare.
The new human coronus 2019 (2019-NCoV) which later became SARS-CoV-2 is the continuous epidemosis factor of Cronos 2019 (COVID-19) and has taken 3 March 2020 lives and killed more than 100,000 people.
The alarm bell is ringing, and the world must be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 disease.
All seven types of human Cronos have an animal source of bats, rats, and domestic animals.
Multiple evidence confirms that evolution was the origin of all human corross, bats, in which the virus is well matching, but non-interferenced, and high-stincision variation.
In addition to the fact that it is not a matter of time, it is a matter of time.
The origin of the animal is the origin of the human chromatus of the Chukkatian human species to understand natural history, insulation, and masculinators of the species.
It may also result in a system of research on tank animals, interfaces, and the SARS-CoV-2 disserving, and may be used for similar events in the future.
In this review study, we present a general view of the animal origin, the transfer between the species and the function of the blankets of human corross.
In particular, it's common that human parents' virus is common in their tank hosts, but after the transfer between the species to a new host, it's a blanket.
We continue to examine the evolution of human Cronos, where the increase in transfer ability is often accompanied by the reduction of blankets.
The ongoing process of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed in the same text.
Animal Cronos have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the early HCV-229E, the B814 river of patients who had been exposed to the collapse of Mentans, different types of Mantan animals, countol of turkeys, rats, pigs, psoch, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven human Cronos were identified.
A brief summary of the discovery of human sinus can be helpful and useful in time (Jedol 1).
The first HCV-229E step was taken from a patient breathing way that had been used to match the higher part of the system's breathing system, after which it was adapted to growth in WI-38 breathing Lanes.
The HCV-229E patients showed signs such as normal collapse symptoms of headaches, seizure, feeling disease, and coughing, along with fever and cough at 10 to 20 F.C.
After this, the HCoV-COC3 was separated from the plant and the next gun station in the brain of the rats.
An oath is found to be similar to that created by HCV-229E, which is similar to the symptoms of the disease of antan soyressis of the flu virus "A" and "Rinovos" are similar to the symptoms of disease.
The HCoV 229E and HCoV-OCID have both developed globally and are generally transferred during the winter season and in the gentle environments.
In general, the time for these two virus failures is less than a week, and the disease for a period of about two weeks turns out.
According to a human study above the volunteers, the honest people who were taken to HCV-229E were given a little fall.
A few patients were spent with weak fashion systems, severe entangled in the breathing system.
The "SARS" also known as "Ponmony A.R.A.R.A.R.D., was the first documentary found in human life in the history of human life, and its i.e., the i.e.
The first case of Sars can be traced to the province of Gongdong in late 2002.
It has led to 8096 incidents reported by 747 deaths and has spread throughout many countries and continents.
Despite the events of mass spread, it was estimated that any event could lead to almost two secondary Anathans, with the period of 4 to 7 days, and the virus load of the virus that appears on the tenth day.
Patients who were exposed to SARS-Covo first had symptoms such as pain, headaches, fever, weakness, and earthquakes, and then the breath of distress, cough, and breathing disorder at the last stages.
The number is out of range of liver function tests and high-level caininins from the common non-interference results of SARS.
In SARS sick patients, there has been a really widespread damage to the Alolar, the precipital sequencing, and the increase of microphages.
About 20 to 30 FF, patients need severe care and air air care.
In addition to the substance system, multiple organs of the system can be common in these cases, which is usually associated with a occupants storm, and may especially be killed in the patient's weaknesses.
The virus was first separated from an open lung biopsy, one of the patients who traveled from Gongju to Hong Kong.
Since then, there has been a lot of effort to study above human Cronos.
In late 2004, HCV-NL6 was separated from a seven-month-old kid from Hadland.
It was first observed that among little children, the weak and sick who have a weak or breathing system is common.
It is common for the disease created by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study describes the separation of a similar virus from the sample of an eight-month-old children in Hadland with breast and hugs.
Although this case has been identified in Hadland, it's actually published throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the factor of about 4.7% of breathing disease and that its spread is peaked at the dawn of summer, spring and winter.
The HCV-NL63 is also associated with the continuity, also known as HCV-NL63, which is also known as HCV-NL3.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 separated from a 71-year-old man who was placed in Hong Kong with breast and hugs and Brunishulit.
In addition to chest and hugs, with mass spread, HCV-HKU1 has been reported as well as a critical stymia.
HCV-HKU1 was identified as the cause of hyperbolism, such as HCV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCVVV-OCCCCID around the world.
All four of these cases of human coronus have been well-resolved with the spread of populations and are generally less likely to cause disease with long blanket blankets, although unknown reasons have really been shown to be a rare form of HCV-NL3 disease, which has recently been reported in China due to severe substrates of the system.
In general, when these human connectors get the ability to communicate and maintain their constant energy in humans, it reduces the immunity or the ability of their blankets.
The MERS-CV was first separated in 2012 and in Saudi Arabia, from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had been swept away by severe breast and breast arrests and lack of disintegration.
Although most confirmed most of the development began from the Middle East, in European countries and Tons, several recent imports have also been observed at times due to close contact.
A second-class spread occurred in South Coria in 2015 where 186 events were confirmed.
It is similar to the saris disease, which is known by the chest and the severe side of the process.
In contrast to SARS, many MERS patients find severe dissatisfied dissatisfied diseases, which are unique amongst infected diseases due to human sinus.
More than 30 percent of patients have symptoms such as diabetes and vomit.
A 14FB, more than 200 confirmed incidents have been replaced by a high rate of 34.4% death rate, which has caused the MERS-CV to become one of the most well-known virus known to human beings.
In the middle of the late mid-Ember month 2019, Clersters were seen in Vahan, Hubi province, China, which has now been known to have been associated with SARS-CV-2.
The World Residental Resident of Antan's spread has been called a concerned state for public integrity in the international world, and called it COVID-19.
Ally's history of 3,2020 has been confirmed by 9053 cases worldwide, and the ratio of death was about 3.4%.
The rate of death in Hobi, China is 4.2%, whereas outside the country is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, causes severe breathing because of fever, cough, and fatigue breathing.
It's also seen in some patients.
The chest and side are one of the most severe symptoms, and fortsa could be an acute breathing syndrome.
However, the SARS-CV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of 82 high-of-the-regence physlology of the nucleotide, they are placed in two different colts of the elephant tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less likely to be transferred to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Unsigned cases have been reported to SARS-CoV-2, and may quickly help spread it around the world.
Compare and find differences between SARS-CoV-2 and six items of other human Cronosis, shows the existence of a number of similar differences and differences that are very interesting.
First of all, the period of insurgency and age is very similar to the human sinus disease.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 shows the total process of six items of the other human Coronaus.
Second, the COVID–19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and four human coronos with mass spread (HCoV-229E), HCoVV-CCCID, HCV-HKV1 and HCVV-NL63.
On the other hand, Antan SARS-CoV-2 shows properties that are often seen mostly during the time of Antan with the spread of human chromatosis, countol, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small substrate of COVID-19 may also be considered as the sample of SARS-CoVV, although its ratio is slightly lower.
The transfer of SARS-CoV-2 continues to show interesting patterns, which are both known as human chromos with mass spread and SARS-CoVV.
On the other hand, the ability to transfer SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as other human chromoss with long spread.
On the other hand, it must be determined whether the possible transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced to different humans after your home, which occurred to SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
In the end, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified as human occupos, as well as SARS-CV-2, as well as the SARS-CV-2.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 transfers, at least under some circumstances, play an important role similar to the SARS-CoV item until it is not correctly known.
It's still interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2, like really, has a seasonal state.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 will be affected by the ability to transfer it, the ability of blankets, and the permanent development of human history in the final of COVID-19.
Every four of the human connects well with the spread of a population that causes mild symptoms of disease.
On the other hand, it may still be true that humans have been well compared to these four human corross.
In other words, both of them can be the survivors of the paldium disease of the old man.
The human corrosors who cause severe disease in humans and humans who have been diagnosed with severe human disease have been removed from the study.
For this purpose, human coronos have to be multiplied enough in humans to allow a match-resolved deaths that disables the host's restricted reflector.
In this case, as the SARS-CoV-2 spread, and the more souls are exposed to this disease, this virus has more Chans virus to adapt to humans.
If this virus matches well, it can be hard to prevent it from being transmitted by corneas or sasser methods.
Throughout the long years, the four Cronos were going through the spread of populations, and in such individuals who had a mere system of narmal functions, they caused normal sequencings.
They don't need an animal tank.
In contrast, long blanket-CV-spons and MERS-CV virus have not been properly adapted to humans and their transfers in humans have been stable.
They must keep themselves in animal disorder, and usually the seed of one or more interface hosts, looking for an opportunity to transfer to human purposes.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features with Sars-SARS-CoV/MRRS-CoV, and four human coronus with mass spread.
Just like the human coronos with mass spread, at least now it has a high transfer.
However, it is more common than Cronos with a population of blankets, unless its blankets are less than SARS-CV or MERS-CV.
The question is whether it matches humans completely and is moved into the future without need of a tank or an animal host of interfaces.
Before the above argument of the animal origins of human corross, let's talk about the properties of evolution, natural, tank, inter-intervesing, and re-resisting human chromus.
An animal, if the host of evolution, is the host of a human coronus, is a shelter of one of the closest ancestors and has a high biological level at the level of self-registery.
The original virus is usually well matched with the host and non-operic.
In the same way, the host of the tank keeps a constant and long term of human Coronaus.
In both cases, hosts are naturally used and act as a natural host of human connectos or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the human Cronous is recently transferred to an interface host at the same time, it does not match the new host well, and it is often a blanket.
The host of the interface can act as an animal source for man and play the role of a removable host that allows the virus to be transmitted and then transferred to humans to increase human scale.
If a human Crovenus cannot keep its transfer in the interface host, its origin will end with the concrete end of the dead.
On the contrary, human coronos can adapt to the host of the interface and even create long-term native disease.
In this case, the host of the interface will become a natural tank host.
In the re-information of epidemiology, the case of SARS had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The next analysis of Sirmi's spread showed that the spread of security and spread of GS-CV against SARS-CV in animal merchants was more common than the public.
The masked palm-smalled Zamuma Laarvata and a Raconon dog in live animal markets were first identified as the first carrier of SARS-CoV viruss that are almost equal to SARS-CV.
The case was unintegrated and based on the fact that after the death of all the winds in the market, which other SARS events were not reported.
However, reportedly, the masked palm-smacks were reported in wild nature or farams, which had no contact with living animals markets, usually negatively, in other words, that the masked palm winds may be able to use the host of the virus, not the natural tank of SARS-CV.
It's remarkable, since 80 percent of the animals in the Goongju markets have anti-SARS-CoV, the probability that several species of small mammals can be ignored by SARS-CV hosts.
It turns out that all of these are the final SARS-CV.
The search for the natural host of SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a very close bat-to-the-back Cronos, which is called the Rhulovus bats associated with HK3 (SARS-RAR-BatCovV) and is found in Chinese horses' boots.
The result of the anti-CV anti-S-S-CV test and the SARS-RR-BatCoVH3 test was positive in these bats.
This and SARS-Covoyros have 82–92% of the species of sARS-CV.
These studies have developed a new concept, which means bats are hosting human blankets.
Several sub-CVs (SL-CVS) have been identified as bats, but none other than a virus called WV1 can be separated as a live virus.
Enzium 2 is a human angitosin (AEE2) known as the SARS-Cov.
It turns out that WVV1 is the sample of bats, AE2 bats, Zalabad, and Man into the room.
In an interesting way, the patient's garlic was able to disarm the WVV1.
Up to this point, WV1 shows the nearest ancestors of SARS-CoV in bats, which has 95% of the autobiology of the self-resolves.
Despite the high-of-the-regnosis between these two viruss, general belief is that WV1 is not an interface parent virus for SARS-CoV, and the bats are not the first hosts of the SARS-CV tank.
In the same group, Philos-Cov is the CV-HKO4 bat and the CV-HKU5 bat.
The CV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV both use the same host resertator to enter the virus, called the DP4P4 (DP4).
RNA's resiliences are much closer to the species of bats that have been identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, which MERS-CoV is not found alive in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest bat relative CoV-HKU25 are only 75% of the same microsymology.
In fact, bats may not be the first host to the MERS-CV tank.
On the other hand, studies done in the Middle East show that camels of a mountain are positive, in the case of the MERS-Covs, such as camels with Middle Eastern origins that exist in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV was taken from the camel sample of the camel, which shows that camels play the real host of the MERS-CV tank.
It is necessary to note that there were generally rare symptoms in camels that had been tested to MERS-CoV, but also extreme viral re-resolation.
It is necessary to recall that mentan camels are moving the virus, not the cost of breathing methods, but also through anti-fumy ways, which is also the main way to transport the virus in bats.
And yet, there are still questions left, because many of the people who really didn't really have contact with the camel before the symptoms came, so it can be concluded that the disease was transferred to human beings, or passed through the unknown animal methods of MERS-CV.
SARS-CoV-2 shows as much as 96.2% of the RTG13 bats separated from the RHinolphous bats, the nucleotoids.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sympathism between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is more than enough to be considered parent relations between them.
In other words, bats may not be the first host(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 tank unless the bat's corross are nearly found in the future.
The animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among the wild species that were sold and killed in the main market of the Havenan food market, an oath that many of the early Koveid-19 were connected to and marked the possible event of transfer from animal to human beings.
Several new studies based on the sequence of molecular sequence showed that a group of small mammals were the risk of extinction, called Pangolina, could also be the origin of the Cornosios Beati related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new gynomiums of Cronos Pagulin, 85-92 F.F.F.I.I.E.L.L.D., have a self-regnosis with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they have a measure of about 90 Fs in the surface of the noralotide level with the RTG13.
They form two substrates such as SARS-CoV virus in the Philosopher tree, which are more similar to SARS-CV-2, and the amplified amphithyl of its 1960.4 FF.
In a very opposite way, the SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 have a much more inference, although there are more genetics in them.
A previous study above the sick Palogins also reported a viral count of lung samples, which turns out to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, different collection methods and manual selection were used to create a minor Jinium resilience, which has placed about 86.3% of the virus's support period.
We can't ignore the possibility that Pangolin is one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 interface.
However, there are currently no evidence of the direct source of Paloglin for SARS-CoV-2 and Coroniosbita associated with SARS-CoVV-2 in Parloglin, which is based on the direct source of Paloglin for SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the Brentus associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Pünglin.
SARS-CoV-2's evolution path in bats, Pagulins and mammals must be specified.
While the highest molecular matching is found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, the bitos related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CV2 and RTG13 have the highest shared in the Jinium level.
==Presidents==The high proportions between the RBDs of the Corrovius bits are formed by SARS-CoV-2 in Pargulin and SARS-CoV-2 by evolution with the selection.
It is a mutual offer to the advantage of the noise of the noise between a gyte-ponglinus (SARS-CoV-2) and the RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
Nokkkeby is a preemptive power winner of evolution amongst the Bita Merges.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2 non-information, the investigation is still being done and can't be expressed with certainty.
In addition to human chromosis, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoVV-OCID, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKKU1 have been studied.
Phillytic evidence showed that HCoV-NL6 and HCV-229E both may have been made of bats, while HCVV-CCID and HCV-HKU1's parents were found in the atmospheres.
It has been reported that a bat's ARCV 2 (APACCV), known in three colors of North America, has a close relationship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is a substrate of another bat chromos, HCVV-229E, which was discovered in Nigeria, while the camels are thought to be hosting it.
To be clear, the current knowledge is in link to the origin of the known human corrosans in form 1 and table 2.
Phillytic analysis has provided evidence for transmission events between the species of human corross throughout history.
When HCoV-OCID was transferred between the species in 1890 to transfer from domestic animals to human beings, an entanglement system was registered.
The history of the transfer between the HCV-229E species is not very specific.
The Alpha Cronosis were found with closeness to SARS-CoV-2.
Between them is an Alpha Alaka.
Multiple evidence supports the importance of direct virus transfer from bat to human beings.
At first, humans may contact bats because they are present in the common Nich Ikologicals, not Alkakas.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with Alkakas.
Second, the alpha larvas of bats related to HCV-229E and in bats are non-integrated, while the chromocus Alpha Alka caused an infection of breathing disease in Mantan animals.
Finally, in wild animals, which case has not been seen by the Alpha Alka.
Therefore, it is not possible to ignore that Alkakas take the Alpha Coronauros of HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human blankets, countol of the Harry virus, the Abola virus, the Nipa virus and Indiara virus.
So it's not surprising that the bats may have transferred HCV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, although the Alpha Crovenus is acting as the HCV-229E XP, the Alkakas and camels of a mountain can play a role in the form of host interfaces that transfer the virus to humans, an oath that happened about the MERS-CVV.
The MERS-CV disease is an excellent example of transport between a species of bats to camels of a mountain and more than the camels of a mountain to humans.
In the initial identification of MERS-CV, bats were revealed to be the source of disease evolution and to other findings confirmed it.
It is clear that bats are a rich source of viral species to exchange between the geneal species and the transfer between species.
"A long life long life, credited colonys, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, all conditions for bats are ideal for "the virus spreader."
On the other hand, MERS-CV has been placed in camels for decades.
The virus has been well matched with these camels, which has been made from an interface host to a stable and natural tank host.
The MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and the rate of death in these animals is relatively low.
It's a random event to human beings, and humans are hosting the dead end of the MERS-CV package because its transfers can't continue between humans.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CV, the role of the Palogins is different if they have any role -- in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, the Biti Pagulins in the Pargolins are very pragnic.
They may be hosted to be the dead end of the Alpha Cronosus-Cov-2 Alphas, similar to the Zhards in link to SARS-CoVV.
Several possibilities to transfer between the SARS-CoV-2 species of animals to humans must be confirmed or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can host the tank of a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings may have shared by working in butchery or mine with bats.
In the second place, the Pagulins can be one of the interface's resizing hosts that recently entered the virus associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The human species of butchery and the use of prey meat can be used by this virus.
Many mammals may be exposed to domestic and domestic animals to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals needs to be used to investigate the anti wind.
The oath at the top may have happened in a third species, both bats and Pagulins, and the SARS-CoV-2 match.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still running.
In addition to all kinds of animal hosts, there are three major tumors of the virus that are placing the barriers between the species for the corrosus.
First of all, their relatively high rate of Jenny's masculinity is in the flow of RNA.
In contrast to the other TNA virus, depending on the phase of the Coronaus, with new hosts, the estimated motivation rate for the Coronios is based on the rate of replacing the Ostorus 10–4 years in the location of the 2-year-olds, the "constitution" can be considered "by" to "high".
The Coronaus has an unreadable oscillation of oscillation, and the removal of it leads to death and a very long weakness, or even to the loss of it.
It is noted that the algorithm is known as Remdiscier in the resusciprovation process of resusciprovation, which is controlled by the oscillation of the oscillos and the RNA that is related to the RNA.
Remsive is one of the best spices to deal with SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested as a clinic.
However, the prices of the mutism of the Cronorus are almost one million times more than their hosts.
In addition to this, the motivation rate is usually long when the Coronaus have not been properly matched by the host.
In contrast to the high rate of motivation in SARS-CoV, the rate of sARS-CoV-2 is less significant than that of the higher level of the human level.
It may already match another host that's responsible for humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is true for MERS-CVV, which has been well matched by camels of a mountain.
In the opinion of Tioric, the person whose thighs can be swept away as fast as the WARS and anti-CoV-2 anti-prov-2.
Secondly, the Great Janeum RNA in the Coronaus, in order to correct the Janemi for the mativism or the noise, increases the probability of evolution between a species, which will help with the presence of the new Cronosus when it is prepared.
This is supported by open, unique, and protein functions which have been swept to the end of the 33th Janeum.
"Tressically, the Coronaus, the seed of a mechanism, the selection of the "captively" by Capi, turn patterns into randomly and often.
In the host that acts as a micro-massion, the turning string into the RNA corony of the chromos is often done.
The RNAs can be combined with long, well-resolved, and sub-servation to produce new corross.
The evidence of natural noise in HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OCCID were still seen in animal corross such as SL-CVV bats and CoV-HKU9.
The action between the host and the virus in connection with the transfer.
In addition to the three virus labs mentioned above, the virus interaction with host resparator is one of the key labs that affect the transfer between the species.
Here, SARS-CoV is considered as an example and has shown evidence of positive choice during the events of the transition between the species.
According to the comparison between SARS-Cov and Zauld's SARS and ZW, an oath is found to match the various hosts, especially the Mussden seed in RBD and Protein S.
Generally, RBD in Protein S interacts with the Hussroy RBD and is strongly chosen by the host's anti-frequency reaction.
RBD is located in SARS-CV in amino acids 318–510 on the S1 piece, resulting in common virus transplants, and is still common remutators to enter the virus.
The SARS-CV connection has been able to detect different animals from bats, zabad, mouse and rockons; it makes it possible to transfer between the virus species.
In fact, the six remaining amino acids were seen that RBD was different from different viruss separated from humans and Zabads, and that four of them are in Mutifre's connection to action and activity with the ACE2.
SARS-CoV Zabad, has two mots of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the dependence of protecic interaction with the ACE2 human reservators.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements can play a vital role in a virus match with humans.
It is the same as SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoVV.
A 30-fidre difference between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CoV at S-1 shows that the tendency to link SC2 to human ACE2 is likely to be human.
In fact, a Cryo-AM study shows 10–20 times higher than the link between AE2 and S Protein S belongs to SARS-CoVV.
It is still interesting to determine whether or not any more help is to transfer compared to the high rate of death in SARS-CoV-2.
It's interesting that HCV-NL63 is linked to an Angitin (AE2), but with a different part of S.
There are many other humans, more humans than HCV-229E, and 9-O-O-Sylic fluids for HCoVV-CCCCID.
This could also be the reason why these corross are successful in humans after the transfer between the species of host animal.
In addition to the hareptores, the result of the transfer between the human species is affected by the sysser of attachments to the host and limited labs.
These host proteins can form a barrier between humans and human natural tanks, such as bats, camels, and birds.
For a kind of successful transfer between a successful species, human coronoss must take the host's dependators and suppress the host's restricted generators.
In this case, the multi-massing factors in this important field must be identified and identified.
A non-resolved SARS-CoV-2 is used by advanced CISPR technology, which can be used by SARS-CV-2.
The rise of the new human corross: · Global Voices
The variation of the bat's corross provides a lot of opportunities for the rise of new human corross.
Based on this, bat chromoss act as a source of soulic corross.
In addition, the fast-stressing and resective resilience also causes human evolution and acts as two important steps in this process.
For example, either the loss of the new Janes of Protein, it is potentially possible to correct the virus's Physitopes in a remarkable way.
Among the SARS-CV side proteins, it seems to be important to adapt to humans, because bat viruss associated with SARS-Cov were separated, but it turns out they were placing the ORF8 proteins.
==SARS-CoVs==A symbol was found in separate races at the beginning of human epidemia.
It divides the OF8 into the EEF8a and the OFF8b, and is a type of matching mossis that causes a move code between hosts.
In addition, the SARS-CoV may have had a history of reoccupation between Alpha Linges and the Cronosian Steps, based on this basis, a number of smaller parts of the RNA in RNA, depending on RNA.
Recursive positions were also identified in NSP9, the largest part of nsp10 and nsp14 parts.
Similarly, it turns out that in the U.S.S.-C.E.E., there was a really great deal of noise between different Lincolns that took place in the camels of a mountain in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CV and MERS-CoV, there are also events in other human sinos, in which human chromosis are found with animal sinus in their non-informations.
There is still a warning that artificial selection can play a role in the creation of unresolved changes in the virus's Janeums, which are most likely to be released from chosen pressures, for example, from the host's host's system.
One example of these effects is that the complete length of the EF4 is lost in the HCV-229E protocol, which occurs due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although I am healthy in bat and camel-related virus HCovV-229E, the Naklutides have an Al-Kallutide extension, which leads to the mitism of the mutism.
In recent times, the evolution of new human sinos also goes by pressing the selection of their tank hosts.
When bats have been identified to Cronos Manton, non-signed cases or with mild symptoms, which indicate the match between the Cronos and the bats.
It turns out that bats, whether they're antomist or analytic, have been well compared with Cronosus.
For example, the disorder inencision of the initial reciprocal response in bats will effectively reduce the pathology that has been activated by the Cronouss.
In addition, natural kill room activity in bats, due to the rise of the natural kill room production of NKG2/CD94, and the low level of speech of the lilalls in the first class is reciprocal.
In addition, high levels of compounds include active oxygen (ROS) resulting from long bat activity, can also be used to suppress the resusciprocal resustration and affect the preoccupation of the preservative sample, so that the pressure to produce virus soys that when they enter a new host has long effects.
The Coronaus rivers are also evolved with higher blanket properties, which leads to new proteins or protein properties for the host's compatibility.
So, it's not a coincidence that three new human Cronos have appeared in the last two decades.
The Cronouss are not blankets, or in their tank hosts, such as bats and camels, they make a very soft turn.
They're highly re-resolved without creating a strong fashion response from the host.
There are puzzles here why non-explored continuitys are seen, and what really causes severe human antan.
The severe symptoms are usually due to over-intensive responses and storms of cytokin, where the more powerful reaction will be to the lungs.
In contrast, in the non-signed illustrator, the answer is separated from the resusculated Cronos.
The same strategy may have a positive effect on anti-SARS-CV-2 in anti-sympathetic response.
The answer to the bats is particularly strong.
Thus, the use of Interferon type I must be useful at least at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
In addition, the NLRP3 activates the NLRP3 in bats.
With this logic, NLRP3 is useful in COC950-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same way they created SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
However, with SARS-CoV, it has a 95% nucleotical equivalence, but there is a bat's chromatosis with SARS-CoV-2.
While Zalabad and other animals in the markets have been known as hosts such as SARS-CoV, the first host of SARS-CoV-2 interface is not known.
The Biti Paloglins have been discovered as a surprise with SARS-CoV-2, showing that the Pagolins may have been acting as an interface host, or that Cronosios Legollin may have played part in Jenny's final version of SARS-CoV-2-2.
However, the question remains, which evidence does not exist that SARS-CoV-2 has been built on purpose or random by humans.
The Coronaus have returned to the focus of attention due to the recent spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of trumpets in bats and animals has turned us into a remarkable understanding of the importance of animal origin and human repositorys in its transfer to human beings.
The evidence has shown that the source of SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 are the bats, and the seed of the interface was transferred to the human being.
In view of Ethan SARS-Covo's contact between humans and ZWs in the market, closing market markets and killing the ZHS could effectively end the SARS electrode.
In this same logic, due to the discovery that several linges of Cronos have a close-to-SARS-CoV-2 near the SARS-CV-2 have to be collected from traffic markets to prevent animal transfer.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans or not in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CV has long been present in the camels of a mountain.
These camels are as an important tool for Transport and are still a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local souls.
They've been published wide in the Middle East and Africa.
So the sacrifice of all camels for the MERS Consulate, similar to what happened to the SARS-CV and SARS-CoV-2 in the link to the wild animals of the Chinese market, is practically impossible.
In order to stop the spread, the MERS must have a comprehensive approach in camels to make effective VS-CVs to deal with the camels, and with it all have the continuity approach for the Controll of Antan.
Because we can't take out these viruss, they may create and spread new Janeotips.
There are several types of animal coronos moving around in the wild.
In particular, bat chromos are very diverse with the ability to transfer from animal to human beings.
There are a lot of opportunities for these animals to develop or produce noises, something that will lead to the rise of new corross that will be able to transfer or/or kill more people in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be forgotten to reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In view of the disasters caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan should be provided.
In fact, many viruss have been on this planet for a long time.
They're like in their natural waste to get the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many features that help spread the virus, if people learn enough to stay away from these animals, the probability of human contact with bats and wild species can be reduced.
The constant observation in mammals is essential for understanding better than the icarology of the Coronaus and their natural hosts, what will be useful in their origins from animals to humans and their development.
The most effective way to get a virus from animals to humans is to keep humans away from natural cities of transmissions from animals to humans.
Several pieces are still missing in the SARS-CoV-2 source puzzle.
First of all, if bats are moving an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to the Palogins, it would be interesting to see what conditions the bats and Pagulins can share the same Nich Iological.
Secondly, if bats play a direct role in transport to humans, the way human contact with bats should be identified.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real interface host, the way it interacts with different types of people, bats, and pagulins must be identified.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, it must also be met and created as an embolism.
Whether this happens in a bat, one palgolin or another mammal, it is expected to be found in its natural host SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that is almost similar.
The ongoing research in this field will turn on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with an important deformation in connection with the Coveid–19 Convalence of humans.
It's necessary to see Koveid-19's "discisive" and "confirmed" standards.
In 6.20, our team published a quick instruction to identify and identify the new virus, 2019–NCV, and this guide gave us our experience and provides a good reference to fighting it all over the world.
And yet, the Corona virus was the 2019 virus, our knowledge is increasing based on constant research and medical experience.
In this letter, we responded to an opinion in the link with our guide, and presented the latest suspicious and confirmed recognition standards according to the latest recognition instructions of the Koveid-19 (7) provided by the National Republic of China.
In the 20th century, the new virus Corona (2019–NCoV) has led to the spread of an infection which is now named after the disease of the Corna virus 2019 (WD-19) and the Botha virus is a severe breathing virus.
On March 11, 2020, the World Right World Organization introduced Koved-19 as a Padmi disease.
With the goal of combating the SARS-CoV-2, our team has provided a quick T-ray instructions that has been online published in military medical research (MARS-CV20).
This has taken a lot of attention since the release.
Note that Koved-19 is a new disease, based on constant research and medical experience, our knowledge and knowledge gradually increases.
For example, the responses of Koveid-19 were published by the National Republic of China (http, wwww.nc. g. g.c.cn/) between 16Gv20 and 3 March 2020, all of which have become some of the fundamentals of the people's Republic of China.
Now our instructions have received an opinion from Zhou and his colleagues, based on their clinic experience, they offered a simple offer to grade.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance, and it still has a valuable reference to this pandmi disease all over the world.
We confirm their remarkable efforts and express our gratitude.
However, due to the latest diagnosis and responses of Koveid-19 (7th version) and recent studies, their work also needs to be updated.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), any suspicious feature should be combined with two of the signs of the clinic so that it can be a comprehensive analysis, or should have three cases of clinic signs if the history is missing:
E.D.: (1) A history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and other communities around it, or other communities reported in the past 14 days, in the previous 14 days, (2) contact with the people of the SARS-CV-2 (3) with the test of fever or breathing symptoms of the city of Vahan or other areas that have been reported earlier on the day of the early 19th day, (3) call to the entire area (4 or other regions of the city of the city, or other areas that have been reported in the last 14 days of the city of the city of the city, and to confirm the symptoms of the generals.
The clinic signs:(1) fever,/// or breathing symptoms. (2) containing the description of white cells; (3) the total number of white cells has been reduced at the beginning stage of the natural number set, or the loss of countings.
The confirmed diagnosis should be based on suspicion with one of the bases of a blanket or circus test (1) positive for SARS-CV-2; (2) A positive result of a virus that shows high amplification with an IgM and an IGGS-V2 in the process of testing, or an IGS-DG-DG-DF-FG-FG-F.
We can see that the PCR test has been added to the nucleic acid in the breathing system or blood sample to the second (18G) and 3 (2G20).
The diagnosis of the blood sample was added to the 4th (8G) and 5 (8F20), and then the evidence was added to the seventh version.
These reforms based on the constant efforts of researchers to search for an optimizing acid, which is still a sample of the blood-mass breathing system, which led to the development of certain standards that increased the presence of different samples available and further support of the positive anti-body result.
In addition, there are more and more evidence that tells us to treat patients with unusual symptoms or without symptoms.
Therefore, the ZO and colleagues' flow graph should be viewed, because the person without symptoms classified the clinic in less danger.
A score system must also be confirmed in more clinic activities and studies.
In the end, we hope there are more direct evidence in hand and we ask readers to present their opinions.
In order to identify the suspect and confirm, we suggest that they pursue and follow the latest guidance in their countries.
Our team will continue to provide help in time.
Bangaldish reported five new death items due to Koved-19, the highest number in one day.
Yesterday, Bangaldish announced five death items in one day by Koved-19.
This is the highest number of casualties due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the epidemiology Institute reported the pathology and the Bangalish research (IEDCR) of 114 events in Manhattan and 33 of the recovery incident at home.
There are 17 death items in total.
In an online news report, the IEDCR manager, Dr. Mittrett, Saberina Flora, said that the dead were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Mayi, two cases over 60 were between 51 and 60 and one case 41.50 years old.
He also said there were two victims of Daka.
WHO (WHO) announced on March 11, 19th as a World Podmi.
An official health centre told a local news agency named Anadulu that one of the foots of the Most Gracious, was the head of the Fight Committee of Bangadish corruption, who was taken care of in the Metrey Coate.
==History==Edad Aldder, Minister of Transport Road and Bangalish Bridges on Saturday, said on a online video page that the transfer would be more than the first time since the early bridge, so on Saturday, it would be allowed.
The transfer program began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transfer of necessary goods -- Toby, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first item was seen on March 8, 19 and it was due to two people coming back from Italy and one of them was Manhattan's wife.
On March 19, these three were improved.

On Thursday, according to Daya Pohton John Hokins, the number of patients in the world passed from a million people.
At least 25,000 deaths associated with Coved-19, the disease was caused by Cronos.
It was the day that Malavi announced his first platform to Cronos, and Zia reported the first death of the virus.
On Thursday, North Coria claimed that she was one of the few countries that remained free of the Corona virus.
A.I.E.I.E.I.E.I.E.L.D.I.E.L.D.E.S.S.I.E.L.L.L.D. reports from 793 incidents in 24 hours before 10:00 a.m., at 10 am to central Europe (0600 UTC) at 4 April.
In the United States, over 244 thousand virus events were recorded, which led to less than 1,600 tons deaths.
The CBC news reported it to Daya Poonton Johnskins, who died on Wednesday of 1,000 people in the U.S.A.
All over the world, countries take certain steps to spread the virus.
On Thursday, Sergi Soianin, Moscow, extended the city's permission to open up to 1.
On the surface of the country, President Valdidir Puttin announced that the Russians were paid for less than 30 days without working.
The Pergall Parliament voted 15 days' period, which was the result of 215 votes in accordance with, 10 votes, and one against the vote.
Saudi Arabia announced bans in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for all day long; pre-extensive regulations were applied only between 3 and 6 in the morning.
It was written that Thailand would complete the ban between 10 am and 4 am in the morning.
Wally Ohio, Mike De Wayne, announced that the government had extended the order to stay at home at the beginning of May.
The shops in Australia have lowered the limit of selling chocolate napkins in each transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Wallworth and Colles were reduced to two and a package for every shopping store in every country.
AALD announced the limit of buying only one package on Monday.
These restrictions were placed at the register, and the store's Facebook pages were placed.
The buyer is reported to be stocking sodas because of fear of Koved-19 and their tired.
On Wednesday, Weulworth continued to buy a chocolate napkin to deliver home door to a package in each order.
It was followed by four previous packages for each transaction limit, which was introduced in the fourth and fifth March by Wellworth and Coales.
In his media interview on March 8, he reported that despite the limit of four packages, "many stores will be sold in an hour after delivery of goods," and he read the request "unknown," while the chains stores of the Al-Kys in his post on Tuesday called the "Small."
According to Wellworth speaker, the sale with Shab Tandy got up.
The Casto store in Canber also limited the legal value to two packages last week.
In order to reduce this lack, Coles ordered larger packages to the supplyers and increased the supply of goods, and Welworth ordered additional to the warehouse, and Aldie already stored for a special offer on Wednesday.
Rachel Zimmerman, the director of the South African Union, claimed that he was trying to increase the product, but local authorities' limitations have made it difficult to link the time of Tread Lareys.
He expects the high production base to go, because the providers are trying to remove the demand and have fewer special cases.
On Tuesday, the AALD announced that after the early release of the stocks, some stores could not be sold on Wednesday.
In a news.com.au, the expert at the S.T.R.O., Dr.G.G.M.M., Dr. Mortmer of Penton, Queensland, said that stores have completed their existence every night.
He pointed out that the napkin was an artistry that took a small amount of space in a lot of space. If it was sold, it would empty the large space of the cages and cause lack of sense.
Rachel Zimmerman said to the ABC News, "Colls and Wellworth believe that "if there were enough goods in the lockers, if there were enough products that could be produced like paper and anti-consistencies, you might be able to make this buy a minimum of fear."
The recycler of the reservation paper, "WH Gores a Crap", stated that their existence was finished on Wednesday.
According to News.com.au, Kimberley-Kick, the maker of the Clerix tissue and Solais Piper, the producer of the Surbont product, who worked 24 hours a week to provide the market needs.
The Dmain.com website reported that when the buyer is on vacation due to long-term permission from working days and less benefits are held, some real estate sellers offer free napkins for the first bid at the auctions of the school.
On Thursday's Thursday, the newspaper published in Darwin included an eight-page extension that was printed with the destination and use of a napkin.
According to ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were not at first interested in the activities of the nationals and said that they had no plans to do the limit of shopping.
The production of products, such as mask, anti-consorplicator, dryer, powder, and fluids of the hand are highly required.
In a similar way, outside Australia, it was observed that on Sunday afternoon, the Bretanio, online, O.R.O.O., had limited the purchase of the Twabe napkins to two-packs of 12.
The global organization announces the integrity of Pandmi Koveid-19.
On Wednesday, the WHO organization announced the continuous spread of Koveid–19 due to CARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandmi" refers only to what has been developed and doesn't point to the danger of certain cases, the global organization mentioned the need to move governments to the following cases:
"All countries can still change the process of this fall."
"Tedrus Edham, the head of the World Organization, believes that if countries act against diagnosis, testing, Tedvi, Tjred, tracking and gathering people who are willing to respond."
"We're deeply concerned about the surfaces of the spread and severe disease and the level of unconsistent alarm."
" According to Dr. Tom Friedman's statement, former director of the Controll and the United States disease centers was this "unknown."
"She said, in the published statement "CN" in Frebery, "no more than flu, which other breathing virus has not been identified from the stage of symptoms to global spread."
Ghaberlyus expressed a similar opinion: We've never seen a foot disease caused by the virus before.
"He went on, "We've never seen a foot that can be conned at the same time."
The new condition of a Pandmi disease is the decision of the global organization to declare the spread of this disease with international scale.
Dr. Anthony Fosssey, the National Institute of Institutes of Institutes of Elyticism, and the U.S. population disease in linking this disease to the spread of this disease, "It's going to go on and it's going to get worse."
Since Thursday, Asociated Preses reported that there were at least 12,000 people around the world, leading to more than 4600 deaths.
Pandmi Cronoyros 2020–2019 is a continuous pdenmosis of the Coronios 2019 (Kyd-19), which is responsible for a chronic chronic erosion syndrome of coronus 2 (Sars-Kovid-2).
The spread of the virus was detected in the Wuhan 2019s, in the history of 30 Geniuri 2020, a national concern of the common state of general nature, and on March 11, 2020 it was known as a pdenmy disease.
Ali was reported on 10 April 2020, about 1.6 million people in Koved-19 in 210 countries and area, which caused almost 3,000 people to die.
It's about 364 people who've recovered.
The death rate of people in China was estimated 4.4%, with it, on the global level of 13.4% in 1.1% in New Zealand.
Normal symptoms of fever, cough and breathing.
The disease is caused by chest and hugs (pniumonia) and severe breathing syndrome.
Since the virus's exposure to the virus, the symptoms usually last about five days, but may be two or four days different.
There is no specific anti-virus antivirus for disease.
The early TEDO is actually a kind of sign-up and a supportist. It's recommended to wash hands, cover mouth during cough, keep the distance from other people and check and look at people who think they're mentin.
The authorities around the world have responded to travel restrictions, corneas, travel limits, occupational risks, and permission to establish.
It has led to a severe global social disorder, which has been delayed or cancelled by sports, religious, political, and cultural and broad lack of resources that are caused by fear.
It has been shut down in 193 countries or in a country or in a local area, and it has affected nearly 99.4 FF of the world's world's most-class population.
Bad knowledge has been published in the online space of the virus and has been seen in cases of fear and discrimination against China, other people with races and faces of East and South Asia, and other areas that have seen a lot of cases of continuance to the virus.
Because of the lack of travel and permission of heavy industry, air shit and carbon release.
The authorities of Wuhan, China, on 31 Dsmber 2019, reported a really unrecognizable penmony with an unknown agent, and began to study early in the early 2020s.
Patients were mostly connected to the major market of the Hinan products, so it is believed that the virus has the origin of Zaonuz (the common human and animal).
The virus known as this epidemist, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered virus with very similar features similar to the bat, Cronosicus Pogolin, and SARS-CVV. It turns out that the first person who showed symptoms in him was in 1,2019 and that he had no clear contact with the entire sea market.
It turns out that two-thirds of Manhattan are really connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from South China, which was discovered in the 17th century in a 55-year-old person in Hubi province, may be the first event in Manton.
The important reports may not be reported properly, especially when they have milder symptoms.
Ally 26 F.F.A., relatively few cases have been reported amongst young people, and the cost of 2.4 percent of all patients around the world were 19 and smaller.
It is really related to people who have been tested by the Coved-19s and have been approved and announced in accordance with official protocol.
Since March 23, which country has not tested more than 3% of its population, and the official policy of many countries in Italy, Haland, Spain, and Switzerland has been intended to avoid testing for such people with such mild symptoms.
A published study on March 16, showed that in China, until 23Grey, about 86% of the Koved-19 Antans were not discovered, and these unresolved Antans were the source for 7% of the documented cases.
On March 30, it estimated that the number of Antans in Italy has been reported in a more significant way than really reported in Italy.
The initial estimates of the base (R0) rate (R0) were equal to 1.4 to 2.4.
A published study by the Controll Center and the United States disease center announced it 5.7.
Most people with CO2-19 recover.
For those who don't, the time for symptoms has been between 6 and 41 days of variable, most common of which is 14 days.
From 10 April 2020, about 3,000 feet, it has been attributed to Koved-19.
In China, there were about 80 percent of the deaths in people over 60 years, and 75% of them had previous history of heart disease, heart disease, and diabetes. The official deaths of Padmoid–19 were tested by the victims' post-regnition test, which was declared positive according to official proteins.
The real number of dead-19 is much greater because these numbers do not include people who die without testing, for example, at home or in asylums.
The early DNA from Italy has really identified the number of deaths of the Pandmite 5-4 times the official death rate of Coveid.
The U.S. spokesperson of the Center of Controll and CC (DC) confirmed that "we know that [the tables] are less than real numbers." Reports from the non-nomous number in the United States confirm these statements.
The first death occurred outside of China on 1 F.B.A. and the first death out of Asia on 14th in France.
By 28, outside China's main land, more than tens of foot cases were reported in Iran, South Coria and Italy.
By March 13, it was really reported in over 40 countries and countries, except for the South Pole.
These numbers are different in different areas and different times, such as the number of tests done, the quality of the system of health care, the options of TEDO, the length of the prevalence and population features, such as age, and general integrity.
According to the Poonton accounts of John Hokins, by 10 April 2020, the ratio of death-to-the-life of the world- really human being is 6% (339 out of 16174).
The numbers based on the area are different.
In China, the estimate of the death rate of 17.3% (people starting for 1 to 10, 2020) was reduced to 0.7% (for people after 1.7%) with the beginning of symptoms of 1 FF20). The calculations include the following: the rate of disease (CFFFR) that is identified by a disease shows that hundreds of people die by a disease, and the death rate of this FFFFFFFFFIF (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) that has not been identified) shows a disease that would die.
These statistics have no time limit, and the function of a particular society from moleculars to improve the disease.
Some of the researchers have tried to calculate this number for a particular population.
The Pahton Oxford application center estimates that the rate for global photodemation in total is 0.1% to 0.9%.
The top estimate of this domain is consistent with the result of the random Coveid-19 test results and the statistical study of this test's analysis of the CFR estimates.
The World Organization has confirmed that it is possible to control the world.
The height of the spread and the final time of its spread may be unknown and may be different according to the location.
Macyj Bonny of the State Point of Peon admitted: "If the infection of suicides is not considered, the usual way will remain unregistered after a while, and after the end of available hosts.
"But right now, every logical prediction in linking time to the end of this disease is almost impossible."
"The Chinese government's chief medical adviser, Jong Nanshan, said that if all countries can promote all countries to follow the advice of the global organization to stop the spread of the virus, "It may end by June."
"On March 17th, Adam Kucharski, from London's right-of-the-the-Mads-CoV-2, stated that SARS-CoV-2 would probably stay for a year or two."
"By study done by the College Amperal, by the leadership of Neil Freguson, and by other actions" will be required until the Voxin is available (about 18 months or more).
William Shaffner of Puhton Vanderbilt said, "I don't think this virus would ever disappear -- because it's very contagious," and "it might turn into a seasonal disease that happens every year."
This virus's revalence depends on the release of a pack against disease and its death rate.
Coved-19 symptoms can be relatively unusual and may not be marked.
Two common symptoms are fever (8%) and dry cough (6%).
The symptoms with less spreading include fatigue, production of breathing, loss of sense, pain, muscle pain, muscle pain, gludledness, baldness, clotting, clotting, clotting, bleeding, diabetes or fluids. The global organization states that almost one person of six people is going to get very ill and experience breathing.
The Center of Candol and CC (CC) states symptoms of amplification as breathing, constant pain in a cage or pressure, sudden confusion, problem of waking up from sleep, face or lips; if these symptoms are recommended, medical care is recommended. The progress of this disease can lead to severe chest, stress, stress, and death.
Some people may be without mark, and do not show symptoms of the clinic, but confirm the results of the sequential tests, so researchers suggest that people who are really close to this are careful and careful to examine the development of antan.
The ratio of non-signed patients in China was estimated from minor values to 44%.
Integration is usually different between the time and the beginning of the symptoms (the time between an Antan and the beginning of the symptoms) from a 14 days; in the majority of them is really five days. A sample of the inexplicableness of the Coveid-19 people who lost their sense of smell has been reduced at the beginning of 3% and later to 15%.
Some details are recently specified in the link with the spread of this disease.
It is believed that in the first stages of the virus, the virus is close to contact microbes that are caused by cough, cough, or talk, if we consider the close call between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The studies have shown that when coughing without cover, the drops can be moved from 15 feet (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (2 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may be transmitted by a drop of liquid, for example, when talking, and that longer time in the air, such as breathing and talking may be transmitted, although the virus does not spread the usual way of air seed.
These drops may come into our mouths or noses, and fall into the lungs.
Some of the treatments such as the tube and resusciplation of the lung (CPR) may cause the air-reptions to spread, resulting in air spread.
If you touch a level like a cover and then touch your eyes, nose and mouth, the disease may spread.
While there are concerns about the spread of the seed of filth virus, it is not a very serious risk.
The Chinese government has rejected the probability of a FARS-CoV-2 transfer. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms start, however, may also spread to others before the symptoms begin and at the end of the disease.
People's tests have been positive until three days before the symptoms started, which shows that the transfer is made before significant symptoms occur.
There are only a few reports of unconfirmed cases, but non-signed transfer by some countries has been identified during research tracking people's calls.
The center of Europe's disease (EDC) says that although the easy release of the disease is not determined, a person can usually include two or three others. The virus remains on the surface from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, the virus has been seen that for more than three days on plastics (Pi Proplan) and anti-resolent steel, one day on the metro, and ly over four hours on the copper.
But it turns out that it's based on water and temperature. The coved-19 test has been positive and other animals have been made positive.
There's no evidence that animals can transfer the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend that you lose your hand after contact with animals, just like when you touch other levels of manton.
It was first observed in three people of the chest and hugs in the Wuhan, which had a loss in their blood and breathing problems in their blood.
All of the properties of the new virus appear in Sieer Crona. Out of the human body, the virus is killed with normal soap, because its protection layer is solved in soap.
The disease is thought to have the origin of Zaonosis or common disease between humans and livestock.
Janetic analysis has shown that Corona's virus is made up of bitoxy with bisqueonous compounds, and in substrates of sarbecovius, along with two soys with the source of a bat.
The virus consists of 3,000% of the entire Janeum level, with the rest of the bat's Cactov RTG13 samples.
In February 2020, China's researchers found that there was a difference in certain parts of the genome's resilience, between the Pagulins and the human virus, only one faithful and acid.
In comparison with the entire Jinium to this day, there are 92% of the common acidic material between Cronos Pagulin and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove the Palogins.
A virus can be identified temporarily based on symptoms, although a fixed diagnosis of a restimation chain is confirmed by reverse transmation (RT-CCR) or imageing CT.
A study compared to the responses of the PIR chains (CT) in Wuhan showed that CT is more sensitive to PCR, although less technical, and many of its visual features are covered with other types of breast and side-to-hand processes.
"From March 2020, U.S. Radiology College recommended that "CT should not be used to analyze or test Coveid-19."
The World Reformation Organization has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was the first case in 17 Genuri.
The test uses the reaction to the polymormosis chain of anti-integration (RRR-CR).
The test can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
The results are usually provided in a few hours.
The general way of this experiment is done with the fluory flu, even though it may also be used by the throat.
Ally's history of 6 April 2020, which one of them didn't have enough specific use.
In the United States, a circus test was designed by Celex, which has received permission to use an amerphism just by allowed labs.
The distinct description of the image in the RDI and the CT (CT) images included signs of glass dust, and the sub-integrations were not observed.
The Italian Radiology Association is gathering online video databases of actual disease images.
Because of the continuity with other Antans, such as the Adinos, the image without the final confirmation of PCR is associated with the limits.
A major study in China compared the results of the top cage to the PCR and showed that although the image is less used for it, it is sensitive and fast, and can be used in E.D.
The neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to identify the image features of the virus in radioology and CT photos.
The patient's strategy of transmissions includes maintaining a total self-resolvement, washing hands, not touching eyes, noses, or mouth with unstinting hands, or coughing up in a napkin and throwing a napkin in a trash can.
It is recommended for those who may already have an Antan to use surgery mask in public environments.
It's also recommended for transfers. Many governments have limited all necessary travel to countries and areas under the influence of the virus.
However, in large parts of the world, the virus has reached the level of development in society.
It means that the virus is spreading between communities and some community members don't know where or what they've been sworn. It's recommended that care providers who may be taking care of the person who's taken care of him, take care of them when they call and watch.
The use of the location databases with the governments thus created concerns about privacy, an oath that Aminity Interval, along with more than 100 other organizations, requested to limit such actions.
There have been several volunteers or voluntary applications offered, and since April 7, 2020, there have been more than 12 groups of experts working on friendly ways to maintain privacy, such as Bluetooth's use to enter the Telephone with users.
Then users get a message that asks them if they've been in direct contact with someone with the positive results of Koved-19. The miscognosis has been common in how and how they're going to fit in, for example, nosewashing, and the throat gaps don't work with the mouth.
Which does not exist for Coved-19, but different organizations are trying to reach it.
The washing of hands is recommended for the spread of disease.
The center of Controll and the patient of disease advises people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with water and soap, especially after going to the summer, or when the hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after they're done, they're coughing, cough, or cough.
Because the virus is killed outside the human body with normal soap, because soap takes away its shield.
CDC has still recommended that if there is no access to water and soap, the hand-in-law is used based on Alcol with less than 60% of all of them.
The global organization recommends that people avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be used by a number of solution (one minute exposed to anti-stell levels), including 6–1% Ethanol, 50–10% subpropansol, 0.1% syml, 0.5% highdoxide, and 0.7% of ionion.
Other solutions, such as Benzalcomium, are less effective.
According to CDC, if someone suspects Coved or has been confirmed in a place such as the office or the Center for his illness, all areas such as offices, service services, shared electronic equipment such as tablet, touch monitors, keys screens, and ETM machines must also be destroyed.
The active organizations in the right field have advised people to hold off their mouth and noses when they cough or cough, and immediately throw away their paper paper.
The surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because the mask can reduce the volume and the distance of the breathing drop when talking, the cough and cough.
The global organization has issued instructions in linking time and how to use masks.
" According to Stephen Griffin's statement, "Punton Leeds' virus can reduce people's desire to touch their face, which is the main cause of their transmission with their hands." The masks are still recommended for those who really care for the disease."
The global organization has advised healthy people to use the mask only if they are in high danger, for example, they care for the Koved-19s, even though it confirms that the mask's use may help not touch the people of their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage public use of masks.
In the U.S., C.C. recommends the use of non-medical mask, especially for healthy people of society, especially in contact with about a mile (3 feet or less) with other people to recommend the use of the medical mask once.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgery masks in public transport or crowded places.

The existence of the virus in samples confirmed by the RNA Coronyres.
This is a special test, and it is designed only to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very new or active Antans.
It can be used to detect both the disease and the population.
The anti wind tests show how sick they were, from those whose symptoms were too weak to report or what symptoms they didn't need.
The exact amount of death rate can be specified by using the results of this test.
Because of the limitedness of the experiments, Ali March 2020, which country had no dependability to link to the virus's spread among the people.
By March 23, which country had not tested more than 3% of its population and is very different from the number of trials done in different countries around the world.
Reliability may also be significantly reported above the actual death, which may be highly estimated in some countries.

One of the three sexual tests in the old versions of test kits remained unstable and caused the experiments in CDC Atlanta to face problems; this caused the number of samples that were successfully evaluated in the total of 2020.
The ability of the experiments they use was not determined until 28 Febery 2020, and local and local labs were allowed to start tests.
The experiment was confirmed by the food department and Doa under the permission of the IRRS, and the U.S. business labs began its experiment early March 2020.

The automatic systems with long power in many labs will be able to do these evaluations, but accessing them depends on the ratio of production for each system.
A single blood sample is usually used for ACT, but a single blood sample can be used to follow the answer to the fashion system.
For PCT, blood samples are usually obtained by holeing the volume.
Unlike PCR methods, they don't need to be taken out before the measure. On March 26, 2020, the Food Organization and the 29 companies who had been informed of the organization due to the need to be able to distribute their own suicide experiments.
From 7 April 2020, only one unit test was confirmed under the permission of the IGA.

China and the United States had problems with the ability to trust test the ability to control the test and the countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to cover the applications and correct experts for testing.
On the other hand, experts say that wide access to the test in South Coryria has helped to reduce the spread of new Coronaus.
The capacity to test, mostly in the form of private sector labs, was created over a few years by the South Coria government.
On March 16th, the global right organization announced that bio-massing experiments were the best way to slow down the growth rate of Pandmide-19. The high demand for the virus's extensive spread had caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be (in the United States' private labs) and the supply of samples and alchemoid materials to take place.
In March 2020, China reported that this country was difficult to produce and not accurate.
"In the United States, they had experiments made by CDC; after that, the government removed the barriers to private experiments. Spain bought tests from a Chinese company called Shenz Byytechelogy Cotd, but it found out that the results were wrong."
The company explains that the wrong results may be the result of the lack of appropriate instances or misinformation of test kits.
The Spanish Department of Defense announced that Kates would gather the wrong results and turn them into a different test kit presented by Shenshen Biyasi. 80 hundred of the experiments that the Czech Republic bought from China made wrong results.

Other countries, such as Iceland and South Coria, have managed to run it with hard connections, internal travel limits, testing, and prosecuting it, but had a less difficult permission to enter.
A statistical study showed that countries that have done more diagnosis tests than death statistics, perhaps because these countries are better able to identify the fact that they have only mild symptoms or which symptoms they don't have.
The World Truth Organization recommends that countries who do not have the capacity to do the test and have limited experiences with Coved-19, send their first five positives and 10 negative examples to confirm one of the 16 global reference projects.

A hand wash (or hand wash), called hand maintenance, is a work that can be done to destroy soil, fat, micromiams, or symbills on the hand.
"Singing hands with soap constantly in the critical moment" prevents the spread of many diseases during the day, for example, diabetes and aba, which is transferred to the path of the anti-fami.
People can still have breathing diseases, such as flu or normal collapse if they don't wash their hands before they touch their eyes, noses, or mouth (e.g., ), for example.
There are five important times a day to wash hands with soap to reduce the disease transfer: after going away, after cleaning up the baby's bottom, before feeding the baby before eating, before eating, and after touching raw meat or touching raw meat, fish or makian.

A hand wash can prevent the virus from spreading before using it.
The main goal of washing hands is to clean hands from blankets (bess, viruss or micro-sermins) that can cause disease (and alchemyo material that can cause damage or disease).
It's important for people who work with food or work in medicine, but it's also important for people to practice.
The washing of the hands has a lot of benefits, counting from the spread of the flu, Cronos, and ceressis; and so does the disease that leads to diabetes; and it reduces the breath of breathing.
And the rate of the baby's death rate at home.
A study in 2013 showed that the self-resolved responses of the hand may lead to minor progress in the average growth of children less than five years of age.
In developing countries, children's death rate with breathing and diabetes can be reduced by simple behavior transformations such as washing hands with soap.
It can reduce the rate of death in these diseases by 5.5 percent.
Introverts that promote the wash-up are capable of reducing your hand, about a third of all of it, and this is equivalent to providing clean water in low-intensive areas.
48% of the spinal cord can be associated with soap; washing hands with soap is the most effective and cheap and cheapest way to get diabetes and breathing (ARI), which is done as a routine work in homes, equivalence and communities in the world.
The breast and hug (Penumonia) is a major AR, the cause of a foot between children between the ages of five years, taking the life of 1.8 million children every year.
It is also due to the death of about 3.5 million children.
According to ionsph, turning hands before eating and going to a habit of drinking can save more souls than any vaccine or medical intervention, causing the loss of diabetes to be half and the loss of death due to a hypertension of a fourth breath.
The handwashing is usually completed with other anti-intensives with water, antiphony, and individual integrity profiles (WASH).
The handwashing continues to occur from the yellow wound (impetigo) that is transmitted directly by the call of the physic.
A small loss of hands washing is that the washing of the hand can cause cover damage due to the dry cover.
A study in Danmark, which in 2012 showed that too much of the hands to wash can lead to the rash of the cover that is known to be an osmosis, and this particular effect is particularly among the employees of the men's care.
It is also known as one of the symptoms of a mental disorder (OCD).
There are five important times a day to wash hands with soap to reduce the disease transfer: after going away, after cleaning up the baby's bottom, before feeding the baby before eating, before eating or after touching raw meat or touching raw meat, fish or makian.
Other times where washing hands should be observed with the destination of the disease transfer, before or after a wound or injury, after a cough, cough, or play, after a touch of animal or animal, after the touch of waste.
In many countries, the washing rate of hands with low soap is low.
A study in transplanting hands in 500 countries in 2015 showed that 38.7% of people wash their hands with soap. In 2014, a study showed that Saudi Arabia was the highest rate of washing hands with 97%, the United States had nearly 75% with the minimum rate and China.
"Pergram's vital care that was launched by democracy in the Philippines and is an example of the progress of the level of integrity and teaching and children."
Two times a year, along with the washing of hands, it is the most important thing in the National Program.
In Andinosia, it has been successfully performed.
Remove micro-masses from cover are increased by adding soap or cleaning material to water.
The main work of soaps and cleanings is to reduce the barriers in water, to increase the lawfulness.
The water itself is a cleaner without effect for the volume, because it is not easy to solve the water because it is not easily solved by the heat and proteins that are part of the organic soil.
And yet, cleaning with the current water will be helpful...
The solid soap may have a little bit more than the use of the previous use.
A small number of studies that they thought would be possible from solid soaps in Manhattan have come to the conclusion that it's so unlikely that it's so far off, because the Baxters are washed with soap floor.
The CDC continues to say, "C.C.'s liquid juice is preferred by the use of non-intensibility of hand contact."
Anti-Bertral soaps have been a lot of commercials to promote mass integrity.
So far, there are no evidence that the use of anti-sympathics or anti-symbiotics can be produced in nature.
However, anti-bectral soaps contain common anti-bekterinian materials such as trichrons, with a wide-resistant layer of organic anti-servationals.
So, even if antibiotics are not destroyed by anti-bekterian soap, they may not be as effective as they used to be in the market.
In addition to the cover-rescuit and the maintenance matter, this advanced fortemol may include sharpraps (Syds, asyds, asymptobe acids and turtle acids) of pH, active pH acids with anti-symbis and volumes (allo, vitamins, vitamins, metolls, plants) and oscillators.
The hot water that's comfortable washing hands isn't hot enough to kill the Baxters.
Backters grow faster in the temperature of the body.
However, hot soap water from cold soap is more effective to destroy natural life, containing soil and bretress.
However, contrary to public belief, scientific research has shown that hot water use has no effect on the higher effects of the number of pre-emptive virus.
The anti-stimulator of the hand is a non-water-based factor to clean up the hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand cleaner material (also known as hand-based cleaners based on Al-Col, hand-intensives, or anti-computers).
It is often based on a superpropil or ithol style with a fixer such as carbummeric acid, or a weter such as glycerin in a liquid, or an easy use of Alcoll and a drying effect.
Adding Hiddrogen Peroxide is an increase in its anti-mixy activity.
The electrical anti-servators of Malchii, Backtreyas, cotress, and VRE (MRSA and VRE), would destroy a number of viruss (such as HIV, HIV, RSV, RSV, Voxina, flu, and Hepgititis).
A 7% electrical anti-consistencies can be compared to 99%.1% (e.g., 3.5%) to remove theBeeters on the hand more than 30 seconds, and 99% of 0.99% (4.9.9%) will destroy the hands on the hands in one minute.
The anti-interpreterators based on Al-Cool are almost inconsistencies against the Noralks, which is the most common cause of the amplinable gestrosis. The anti-symmbiotic material of the hand should be used on the cover completely; it has to cover both hands.
The side of both hands and between the ends of all fingers is nearly 30 seconds to dry the liquid, the floor, or the hole.
The tip of the finger should also be washed well by the palm of the hand. The center of the United States and the United States disease center considers the washing of hands, especially when the hands are clearly dirty, more important than the financial anti-consistency.
In addition, the increase of the use of them is based on the use and fast activity of the micro-massing micros, but it should not be used as a substitute for washing the hands properly, unless soap and water are not available.
Reused use of electrical anti-stimulators can be caused by dryness, unless the weter or/or smoother will be added to their forum.
Alcol's drying effect can be reduced by adding glycerins or/or a wet syser.
In the clinic experiments, hand-based anti-interceptives based on Alcol, in which there was a weter and dryer, produced less heat and dryness in proportion to anti-carrial soap.
In Alargik's contact, contact rash syndrome, or an allergic reaction to aalcole, or an added material is rarely happening in the special electric temples of the hand.
Because less is the cause of a touching call than washing hands with water and soap.
In spite of long function, non-hydration factors don't wipe hands from organic material, they spend them on anti-information.
That's why the hand anti-symbillers are not as effective as water and soap to release the blankets, because they're still left on their hands.
The effect of the anti-symbillistism of the hand without aalcole depends heavily on the materials that form it, and historically, it has had a much less effect than Alcoll and Alcolli nuts.
In recent times, the precipitations that use pre-emptive cyclic acids have shown constant and widespread anti-massive activity after their use of themselves, unlike Alcol, which, after repeated use, will probably reduce the volume due to the reverse responses.
Many people do not have the ability to buy soap and use soil and ashes.
The ashes or soil may be more effective than water, but may be less effective than soap.
Another concern is soil or ashes with microbisms that may help more spread disease and not reduce it.
The ashes, like soap, are an anti-information material, because in contact with water, the ash forms an Allcalin solution.
The global organization recommends the ashes or sand as a substitute for soap when it does not have soap.
The right handwashing work that was recommended by the U.S. disease centers for the transfer of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold water.
The current water is recommended because it may be the Radakon pools, although the water temperature may not seem to be different.
Put your hands on the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails with a lot of soap.
The soap separates the microbes from the cover and studies show that people wash their hands more efficiently as they drink soap when they're only using empty water.
Put your hand together for at least 20 seconds.
It's going to create an insurgency that helps with the loss of microbes, and it's going to destroy more microbes for a long time.
Water under the water swing well.
Cleaning in a single sink can be re-integrated.
To dry up with the clean John or let it dry with the air.
The hand is wet and wet and weter again. The parts that don't wash most are thumbs, wrists, between fingers and under the nails.
Analytic nails and nail nails may be mechanical.

The right drying of hands is an important part of the maintenance of the body, but in the link to the most effective way to dry the hands in public water, there are debates.
The increase of the day of research shows that paper cleans are far more accurate than the dryer of electricity, which are used in most of the Africans.
In 2008, a study was conducted by Pohton Westminster in London, and with the financial financial value of the European clean paper industry, to compare the surfaces provided by paper cleaning, warm air, and dry cleaning.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryers, it turns out that the total number of bectres on the floor of the finger grew 194%, and on the palm of the palm of the hand 254%.
The drying of his hand with the air can increase the number of fingers on the bottom of his finger, 42%, and on the floor of his hand, all of it was 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a clean paper hand, the total beakers were reduced to the bottom of an average of 7% and on the floor of their hands. The scientists still did experiments to determine if there's the possibility of reciprocateing and the environment for using any kind of drying or not.
The Irget air dryer, which speeds the air from the car at 180 meters per hour, has been able to get micro-mass micromasses from the hand and device, and is able to enable potential users and the environment to 2 meters away from the machine.
The use of hand dryer will spread micromassiums at 0.25 meters of dryer.
The clean paper didn't show a sign of the distribution of microbisms. In 2005, a research done by T.T.V. Prodoct Umwelt examined various ways to dry the hand.
In the number of bacteria were seen after the drying of hands:

A study showed the rate of antans by using them.
The hand wash is used by the amount of soap and water and water, or flooring and every piece of hands for at least 15 seconds.
The hands must be torn apart by the fingers.
If there is a tut and a cloth under the nails, it is better to be used to clean it up a hair pick.
Since microbes remain in the water and on the hand, it's important that the water is done right and then dry with a clean surface of hands.
After drying, a clean paper hand must be used to close a water tap (and open any output doors) if necessary.
It's preventing hands from re-integrating through such levels.
"The destination of the washing of hands at the regular care centers is to eliminate micro-massing microbes ('Macques) and spread virus."
New England's medical journal reports that the washing of hands is in the most unsatisfiable care environments, and there are also a large number of ditters and males who forget to wash their hands before contact with the patient and cause the transfer of microbis.
A research showed that simple hand wash and sasser can reduce the blood rate of the cutter's seed by 66%. The global organization has published an article to show the way to wash the body and the right anti-consistency of the hands in the regular care labs.
You can find the Precogator of the Hand Resident, which has been established by the organization on the website of the organization available for the public.
The study was conducted by Whiteby and colleagues.
If necessary, trade devices can measure and confirm the maintenance of the hand if necessary.
"The World Rights Organization" introduces five positions for washing hands:
After contacting the blood/information of the body,
Before they tried to counter-op, and...
"After taking care of the patient. Adding al-Kamivi's anti-stimulators will help the soap (tbys or anti-mectobs) with hand-stimulators."
" Such deadly measures may be appropriate before the operation or if the immune organs are very high-intensive. For "Curretion" of the person's hands, it needs to be the water swing without the need to touch the hands, open and close, choose the reservation, or if there's any clean hands to dry up and then another to clean up the layer of nails.

To wash with simple soap leads to three times as much as the amount of carnibal disease transfer to food compared to washing with the anti-bekterian soap.
But soap and water are more effective than the subsidators of the A1N1 virus and cystretrium diphysis.
More research is required to determine which of these interventions is the most efficient in different care courses.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is known as a waste and necessary furniture to achieve proper integrity and even proper food.
However, the lack of water, soap, or clean cleaning equipment in people's homes, in Mactub and at work makes the access to global wash-up behavior into a trap.
For example, in the rural areas of Africa, hand-to-hand swings are near personal or public drinks, while there are cheap options for handwashing.
However, the low thumb rate of the hand can be somewhat stable until the lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and support of hands with soap can affect policy decisions, take consciousness in the link with the benefits of washing hands and make long-term behavior in the population.
It is essential for effective action, surveillance and assessment.
"A review of 70 study systems showed that society's methods have been effective in increasing hands in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.
After at least the Standards can be promoted from one star to three stars at last.
A wash-up operation can be part of a clean-up campaign with a destination to reduce the disease and the death of a child.

A few studies have considered the total effect of the cost of washing hands in developing countries with the DALEs.
However, a review shows that the hand washing of soap is much more expensive than the water-interference and the maintenance of the water.
"The importance of washing hands for human integrity, especially those with vulnerable conditions, such as mothers recently born or wounded soldiers in the kitchens of the 19th century, was first introduced by two self-resolved pioneers: the Hungarian need of Samlos, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was the "Bresssing of the Ages" in the United Kingdom.
At the time, the majority of the souls believed that the Antans were the result of the bad smells that they called Myas.
In the 1980s, the spread of transceivers of food and food related care led to the fact that the centers of the United States continue to promote the active way of maintaining the hand as an important way to start Antan.
The spread of pig flu in 2009 and the global Coveid–19-20 in 2020 took the knowledge of many countries in the link with the importance of washing hands for such suicide disease.

The control of the risk of the working environment for the Quad-19s.
The risk of working in the work environment for Coved-19 means to apply the practical methods of the work to establish the danger and the beginning of the Coronios 2019s (COVID-19).
The risk control at the workplace depends on the work space and duty, and according to the risk assessment of contact sources, disease in society and risk factors for any worker who may be vulnerable to the Coved-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Security, the less dangerous jobs have at least a job contact with the public and other colleagues, it is recommended that they consider at least the necessary means to take care of their work, not to wash hands, to encourage employees to stay home if they are ill, to use masks, to clean, and to clean, and to keep the work.
The average risk jobs can be mentioned in cases that do not require a lot of contact or close contact with suspicious people or Coved-19, but may be due to direct contact with the public or international travel.
This includes employees who are connected to the public in spaces such as Mactabe, the occupants with long population density and some large market stores.
In addition to the initial measures of Antan, the risk system includes air ventilation using high-intention filters with high-intention and access to personal protection equipment for encountering the Coved-19-19-A.
OSHA considers the right-of-the-art care employees who are exposed to contact suspicious people of Kovad-19-Stands working at dangerous jobs, which, if used by the Arosol generators or by taking care of samples taken from suspicious people or Coved 19 to a very dangerous degree.
A number of risk measures for these employees can be referred to as a occupants, such as a negative pressure system and a suitable personal protection equipment for the job.
Coved-19 has a number of effects at the workplace.
An employee may not be present at the workplace due to illness, need to care for others, or fear of being exposed to illness.
Business patterns can be transformed, both in terms of goods that are required and in the appearance of receiving them (e.g. buying out of a messenger or riding field).
In the end, sending goods from the occupants that Coved-19 has deeply affected them can be difficult. To guide security measures can be used to prepare and respond to suicide.
In designs, the level of danger is considered related to work places and various tasks, the number of sources of contact with disease, the risk factors in social environment and home and risk factors for each worker is separate, the number of years of age or maternity to a chronic disease.
It is also specified in the design for the right methods of these dangers and the megaline bridges for situations that may be followed by the disease.
The preparation and response to suicide diseases may be executed by considering national or local advice.
The goal to respond to the spread of disease is to reduce the transfer between employees, protect people with higher risk of disease, maintain business activities and reduce the effects of other institutions in their supply chains.
This disease in society, in places where business is in, affects receiving answers.
The Continuity of the Continuity of the danger is a chot that is widely used to keep the job's integrity and integrity of its location, in order to group the risk system based on the amount of influence.
Where there is no way to remove the risks of Coved-19, the Consulater Consulater and then the office Consulates and thus personal protection equipment are considered the most effective methods of the Controll.
It can be the most expensive solution to the employee's behavior without relying on the employee's behavior.
The authorities are the conversions given in the line of employment and employees must be treated.
The individual protection equipment (PE) is less effective than the authorities and occupants, but can prevent some dangers.
All types of PPE have to be chosen based on the threat they have for employees (for example, medical masks), regularly used, regularly, related search, service, change, and open if necessary, clean and re-resolved, or thrown away to create them.
According to the U.S. Department of Security, there are less dangerous jobs that have less than a job contact with the public or other colleagues.
The number of precautions to take care of the patient’s treatments that are recommended for people in all responsibilities can be referred to as regular washing and support of hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, use a breathing mask, and, of course, access to paper or trash, prepare for communication from the distance or working hours, to encourage employees to use other equipment and plan to clean up the environment.
The immediate recognition and speed of persons who may be considered to be a vital process of protecting employees, customers, clients and others present in the workplace.
The U.S. Consol and occupation centers suggest that employees with severe breathing symptoms should stay at home for at least 24 hours after they have stopped using anti- fever or converting symptoms, and allow employees to stay home for family care and find out about all of these new requests.
According to the SHA notification, the middle-time jobs include jobs that require a lot of calls and at a relatively close range of six feet (1.8 m) and do not know if the clients are due to the Coved-19th, but they continue to travel in society, or due to international travel to the spread of the Coved-19-19s, may be to the SARV-2-2.
This is the number of employees that are in contact with the public, like those that are in the city, the laborers, and some of the large spaces of the Egyptian market.
The members of this group rarely need breathing machines.
If a person is sick in a spring, to protect the employees and other passengers, you can use appropriate methods to separate the sick from others and create at least six feet distances, determine a slave crew for the patient and present a mask to the patient and ask him to wear a mouth and nose with a napkin during a cough or cough.
A cabin crew must wear medical gloves once during service to a sick passenger or touch of physical discharges or levels that are likely to be infected, and if the patient is sick, fevers, coughs, or breaths, they must use other personal protection equipment if possible.
The gloves and other equipment must be thrown into the kitchen's garbage bags once, and the levels must be clean and anti-intensive. To send commercials, the number of ships and other passenger ships, the risk canons include things like travel if you're sick, and immediate notification to the ship's center if you observe or other symptoms on the ship.
In the ideal case, the TDO's pursuit should be done in the room of the infected person. CDC recommends that the sequential and child care centers are closed for a short period of time, because it may be possible that a single person is present in the school building.
When social transfer rate is low or mediumal, you can get help from social distances such as canceling camps, meetings, or other meetings such as singing training or eating in a cafeteria, increasing distance between tables, starting hours and endings, limiting non-resolved clients and using a separate office for children who are similar to the symptoms of flu.
When there is a significant transfer in the local community, in addition to social distances, there must also be a long-term permission to take into account the length of the attachment. CDC believes that there are some direct risks for law personnel who are doing their own activities.
It is recommended for law officials to contact or suspect people in Coved-19 to follow similar treatments to medical guidance, depending on the use of appropriate personal protection equipment.
If there is a close call during the panic period, the employees must clean their seat belts and work before they use them to re-integrate their work belts or home paper, and the working bills are used in the link by keeping and turning away the PE and keeping the laundry of dirty clothes.
OSHA believes that some special employees are placed in the home care department in a very dangerous or dangerous group of jobs.
It is a dangerous job, such as providing honest services, support and medical transport staffs, which are exposed to people who are ill or suspicious of Kovad-19.
If an employee uses aerosol generators, or they take samples from suspicious patients or coved-19s, these cases are very high risk of release.
Aerosol generators can be referred to as a plumber, a need to reduce coughs, explorys, some dental examinations, or an aggressive sample.
It's a dangerous homework where a person must prepare the bodies of people who were suspicious or dead after they died; if it's done on Autopsy's body, they're going to be in very dangerous jobs.
In some environments, negative pressure vents may be suitable.
Examples must be carried by careful measures of biological defense level 3.
WHO (WHO) The WHO organization recommends that new patients should be placed in separate parts of waiting, due to whether they suspect that they are connected to Coved-19 or not.
In the U.S., in Chokat, a comprehensive and auto-symmpathic profile that takes tests on the face, training and medical examinations should be used by N95 masks that have been confirmed by NIOSH or better samples.
Other kinds of breathing equipment can provide more protection and improve the comfort of employees. The global organization doesn't recommend the right use of resusciprocal coverage, because Koved-19 is a breathing disease and the major way of the body's tissue is not transmitted.
The global organization recommends the starting point of Sikrining's surgery mask.
The WHO (WHO) advises those who collect breathing samples from KWO-19 patients without which an aerosol generator can be held, kept, or transferred, to use surgical masks, glasses, faces, gloves, and gloves.
If it is used by an aerosol generator, the surgical mask will be replaced by an N95 mask or FFP2 mask.
In view of the global supply of PEE is insufficient, the global organization recommends the need for individual protection equipment to be given to the minimum: the Madinian trap (the distance distance), the detract barriers such as clear gullins, letting people into the patient room, the use of PPE-19 for necessary work, the use of a mask, the use of medicine, and the lack of other patients while taking care of the same patient, the support of the PE chain, and in the end, and the encouragement of the use of the mask.

Date/time send: March 14, 2020, 11:24 global harmony hours
License grant: which rights is not protected
We see ourselves in interesting situations this month.
The Abdi Koved-19 is something that defines the global connection between humans and our responsibilities to each other.
It's an unprecedented challenge, but we certainly know that our best response depends on the sense of empathy, cooperation, and social responsibility that lies in the heart of this organization.
The empathy and care that we've seen with the e-mail seed, touch and chat among all of our colleagues shows how happy we are that we work with these wonderful people.
I'm very grateful to have colleagues like you.
Last week, someone shared their gratitude for our work with me.
They reminded me how important it is to the world that he now goes to Wiki, and that he who stayed online and was available to all these critical sources is what a powerful symbol is.
Your efforts are to fulfill this, whether you help websites continue to work or get their rights partners or our society is safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the knowledge Viki provides.
Now it's a moment where not only do we do, but how we do it, it's going to have a meaningful effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, there will be a significant change in how we cooperate with each other from last week.
Change of work and schedule.
As Robin said earlier, the C team had a meeting last night to discuss our approach and schedule for days and months ago.
In this conversation, we've considered things that we thought would be the right answer that we'd face and the best way to keep the company effective and stable.
We want to destroy the tension more than anything and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to call again, which one will be fine.
For all employees, contractors and employees:
Until further notice, our work prediction will be about four hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We don't announce a closed situation -- if you're able to work more hours normally, the mission can use your help.
However, the world is now unpredictable and whether you have to take care of your loved ones or look at the ducker, your well-being is priority for us.
We don't register your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
There's no need to mention this, but we're still going to mention it.
Which authority you do not need -- just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and time divisions to ensure that important fields are covered.
(If your test results have been positive, please inform Brian at TGAP;C;C., to help you provide support and make sure that management is enough to take care of your situation.
The livelihood of an hour-to-day person will be supported.
We've already declared and once again committed to honor our commitments to our time contractors and colleagues.
Everyone must receive livelihood according to normal working hours.
If you're sick and you're not able to work, this includes you.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to challenge their stress with the world around them.
What we do, can be incredibly valuable, especially in times like this when we're in it.
Again, we remind you that this is about taking care of yourself.
Our request is that you have a connection with your manager, so we know what we expect and we can set ourselves up on this basis.
Some things are necessary.
There are things we have to do.
SRE companies, HROS, Trust & SFET, and Groups of Financial Help (among others) are doing vital work that may require more support.
We're going to start a process in all units to evaluate the current goals and focus on the support of everything necessary to do this mission.
There's a lot of work to do, we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Lowering the working rhythm now does not cause the next loss.
"We're not going to double time when this fall is over."
You won't be expected to work harder to get the time delays specified, which are now irrational.
We accept that conditions have changed, and we will proceed if necessary to determine new times' goals and tables.
What's going to happen to AAPP?
In order to match the reality and expectations of our new work, we're going to change the time period to deliver our 2020-20-20 program.
We're going to develop our 2019-20 program so that we can spend more time budgeting and let employees put the basic work of taking care of themselves and caring for their loved ones first, and while those who need or would like to work on the work program a few weeks ago.
This time table extension reduces the current working pressure to bridge and pressure on the entire organization.
We'll present our offer to the board next week, and we'll put the representatives and teams in the process as soon as we get confirmation.
We thank the APP team for their leadership.
Status, risk and cleaning at work
Last week we found out that an employee in SF was probably exposed to the COF-19 virus.
And yet, due to caution, we used a group of anti-virus cleaning crews to counter all levels in San Francisco's office.
They used a treatment solution to all levels and remain in the lobby and the room that leads to the same level.
The building implements its care protocol using products that protect its immunity.
We feel comfortable that the office will be fully ready for our return.
Our DC office is located in WeWWK, which has shared its Koved-19 protocol with us and all the DC employees.
In the last week, our DC office became a completely remote method and shared with San Francisco in accordance with guidance.
As some of New York City's fellow workers are aware, we're talking about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These arguments continue, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are going to experience away for the first time.
Our long-term colleagues must be aware that changes may occur, and I needed to make some advice:
The duration of meetings is limited to one or two hours at most.
If necessary, consider the division of the meeting in a few days.

Join China #remoties at the Solque and talk to your colleagues in link to the distribution of work
The Human Resources Operations Team examines the guidance of the axis to support increase the distribution of work in all the foundation.
In the last week, we asked all social aiders to cancel public events with Wikimdia's financial support, such as Edith Ethans by the end of the term, from the World Truth Organization.
We inform them that we understand that your application for canceling and other restrictions can cause the complete payment activities made impossible and that no one will be punished for delaying or turning those goals.
In the last week, we'll give further advice on Wikimania and other local social conferences and subject issues.
It turns out that people in the world are upset about the break, but they feel so relieved that they can focus on their social activities, Viki Madia and other ways.
By taking a step forward, the C is working to create a page on the Meta-Wiki to provide a space for society to keep an eye on the influence and follow our relationship with them.
Be aware of Coved-19 issues.
We'll send an invitation for the next Thursday at 14.00 with the world's time of 0.00 p.m. to hold an employee's special meeting.
We will use this opportunity to share with each other the full-time audiences, answer your questions and contact each other.
We're in this together, and we're ready to help as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information on the e-mail seed and see Office Wiki for all necessary information.
These pages help to see and keep all knowledge in one place.
We're going to do our best to communicate with the employees of the country that's more damaged, regularly related.
If you have any questions in connection with travel, events, a major flow of work, or a cover challenge, or any other matter that you need help to solve, please report to CRI and cooperate with it immediately.
We're ready to serve for support and communication.
If you are aware of a confidential or sensitive issue, please e-mail Brean Judan - the CEO of International HR operations.
Which of these transformations should not be considered to be free of work or commitment.
But on the contrary, right now they kind of show that our work and commitments should match in a new way that had never been experienced before.
These are the steps that we believe is necessary to support one another, to inject our own movement of support and support the world that depends on it.
We'll be waiting for the right time.
Now it's time to support each other and create a space for important things that we'll have in weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need all of you to do this, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when necessary.
Now, please -- close your hands and don't touch your face!

Angitinsin 2B (AE2) is an analytic that connects to the outer level of six rooms, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and embalm.
AED2, with angitosin's conversion activity, counters the rate of angitin 2 and the increase of angitin (1–7) and turns it into an effective purpose for heart disease and disease. ACE2 continues to act for some of the coronus in the input point to the rocks.
The human version is often referred to as HACE2.
Angitinsin 2 is an element of metal, with an element on the surface of the rock inside the vein and other rocks.
Protein ACE2 consists of the domain of M2 pptide of N-Tremenal and Amino-C-Terminal transport domain.
AE2 is a type of chromatical protein that has an active domain that is located on the surface of the rockes in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer range of ACE2 is separated by another ensemble, and the protein is released into the flow of blood, and is finally disintegrated as urine.
There are also many parts of the body: AE2 is connected to the oscillators of the occupants of the rock, mostly the six types, small metrosis, inside and integrations, and the pure larvas in most organs.
AE2 mRNA continues to be found in the brain cortex, in the matter of continuity, hypothalamus, and the stem of the brain.
The main task of ACE2 is to act as an anti-ACE.
AEE Hermon Angitsin divides one into two angitosin, which is the continuity of the artery.
In exchange, the ACE2 separates the amino acid from the ASP-AG-Verg-L-E-Ires-Phes-Phehehes, and gives it to the continuity ethon (H-A-A-A-T-T-I-H-I-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-I-H-H-H-H-H-H-I-H-H-H-I-H-H-I-I-E-E-I-S-H-I-I-E-E-H-I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I-E-E-E-I-I-I-E-S-I-I-I-I-E-I-I-I-E-I-I-E-E-E-I-I-I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I-I-E-I-I-I-E-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-S.
AE2 can cause a number of other peppertides including //ds-RG9 (Dredicin), Neutentin, and Droorphin A and Grelin.
AE2 continues to set the amalino acids of SLC6A19 from the continuity, and is also involved in Hart Nat.
ACE2 acts as the main input point to the room for some of the corross, the count of HCV-NL63 (and SARS-CoVV-2) and SARS-CV-2 (which is the cause of Coveid-19).
A particular approach, a protein transplant in SARS-CV and SARS-CoV2 with an amplified area of ACE2 on the surface of the rooms, leads to autosis and transfer both virus and ensemblems into the rooms.
This process of entry also requires preparation for the protein protein protein of TMPRS2 hosts, which is a possible detractation of a possible TMPRS2. This led to the assumption that the decline of ACE2 levels in the rocks might help to deal with Antan.
However, several letters and institutions have recommended the harmony of the ACE and the TEDARB standard of control.
"The fundamental analysis of the analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of the ACE harnessers has been with the significant loss of chest and side risk compared with the Controlls."
Also, "The danger of the chest and the hugs of the patients who were turned into an angitosin tsin, patients who were more dangerous to the chest and hugs, especially patients with a heart attack and heart failure."
"It was also associated with the loss of death from chest and hugs, although the results were less powerful than the general risk of chest and hugs."
An oath is found that ACE2 is a new reservation (RHACE2) for severe lung damage and has caused the rise of resymbiotic amphimology and exysymphism in the pigs of destance syndrome caused by Lee S.C.C.C.
The half-life of RHACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the beginning of the operation is 30 minutes plus a 24-hour effect period.
Various findings show that RHACE2 may be a promising doo for those who are immune to classical system regeneratives of regeny-engentinsin's system (RAS) or in diseases with long-term angitinsinitis II II II. RHCE2 injections have been examined in a study for the pHCE2 syndrome.
"Coved-19B programs include the "Vyrey-Lyphone" program, designed by the destination of the call to track down the response to the pdenmy disease, 2019-20, which means that the identity process of individuals ('Calls), which may have been in contact with a person.
Many applications were presented or developed with the official support of the government in some areas.
Several Chukkas have been created to create connection tracking programs.
There are concerns in the link with privacy, especially about systems that work based on the location of the mobile users.
Less disturbing options include use of Bluetooth signals to register the user close to other mobile telephonys.

It is built by the Ministry of communications and Teknologi and the Ministry of Truth.
Since 14 April 2020, the program has been waiting for confirmation of Google Play and Apple App.
In the history of 12 April, the government stated that the audience's tracking program is at a advanced level of development and will be available for several weeks. The same program has been planned in Ireland and France (StupCovide).

Some countries use a network-based tracking location instead of programs and remove the need to download a program and avoid tracking.
In Israel, a network-based tracking was confirmed.
The network-based methods that access the raw space database have the potential problems of privacy.
However, all systems with central servers do not need access to personal location data. A number of private privacy systems are created that use central servers only for mutual connections (see the following part).
In South Coria, a non-integrated system was used on the program to track the call.
Instead of using an exclusive program, the system collects data from different sources of cell tracking and card transaction data and combines these cases to produce text messages to suspicious people.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn potential audiences, the government of knowledge has available a location that was allowed to be made available because of widespread changes in privacy laws after the spread of the MERS in that country.
It's the knowledge of a number of programs and websites available to the public, and countries like Jeremyni considered the use of focus systems and privacy.
By 6 April 2020, details were not published yet.
It's a valid idea to track the call to privacy from at least 2013. From April 2020, more than tens of experts are working on the best solutions to maintain privacy, such as Bluetooth's low energy use (BLE) to record the user's close to the other company.
In addition, PEPP-PT is an effort that includes both focused and non-integrated approach and not a single protocol. Unstended Proteols include privacy tracking with privacy support (DPPT/PPT), temporary contact numbers (CN), temporary contact number of events (CN, CN), personal protocols, and mechanisms for access to the Telephone (PAT) and other systems.
In these protools, personal personal databases will never leave the machine and all tracers will occur in the car.

They have still published the description of central technology used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system has been placed so that it can spread at three steps:
Recognizing new tools to make governments capable of creating formal tracking programs by maintaining privacy.
The direct merge of this function in IOS and Andrid; Google and Apple are going to distribute the system to the operating system first and then delete it in the same way after the threat.

Coronios 2019 (coved-19) is an insurgent disease created by an acute breathing syndrome of corona 2 virus (SARS-CoVV-2).
Normal symptoms of fever, cough and breathing.
Other factors may include fatigue, pain, diabetes, gludoid, loss of smell and stomach pain.
Since the virus's exposure to the virus, the symptoms usually last about five days, but may be two or four days different.
Although the majority of cases have mild symptoms, some get to the chest and to the side of the virus and several organs to be disabled.
Since 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million have been reported in 210 countries and region, resulting in more than 15,000 people.
The virus was first made direct contact with the drops of coughs, coughs, or chats.
When these drops are produced during Zefer, they usually stick on the ground or on the surface, instead of moving around long distances.
People may be touched by touching a level and then touching eyes, noses, or mouth.
The virus can survive over 72 hours on surfaces.
In the first three days, the disease is more contagious after the symptoms are started, although the release may exist before the symptoms and at the next stage.
The use of masks is recommended for people who suspect the virus as well as their guardians.
The advice is different about public use of masks, some against the use of masks, some recommend it and some have forced it.
Right now, there is no specific anti-virus anti-virus vaccine for Kovad-19.
This disease is recorded in most countries in all six areas of the global organization.
People who have been infected may have no symptoms or show symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, or fatigue.
The symptoms of amergosis include breathing, pain or constant pressure on the chest, confusion, difficulty in waking up and getting blue or lips; if these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended.
Sometimes, the symptoms of the breathing system can be seen, such as seizure, nose collapse, or the throat of pain.
Its symptoms have been seen in various pheromias such as nausea, depression and diabetes.
Some of the infected in China had the only tightest cage in the top.
In some people, disease may lead to chest and hugs, a number of organs and deaths.
It is called a period of deformation or Camonity period.
It is usually five to six days, but it may be different between two and 14 days.
1.5% of people, 1.5 days later, show symptoms. Reports report that not all of them really need to be marked.
The role of these non-interprets in the transfer is not yet fully known, although basic evidence shows that they may be involved in the spread of the virus.
The ratio of Menton's lack of symptoms is now unknown and is under study, based on Candol and Coria disease centers (KCDC), 20 percent of all confirmed cases remained unresolved during the hospital.
The Chinese National Rights Committee started importing non-signs in the statistics of 1 April, from 166 Antans that day, at 78% were without symptoms during the test.
They both have a lot of disease.
Speak out loud, it releases more micros in contrast to normal speech.
A study in Singpur showed that a cough without a bodyguard could lead to a breathing drop to a distance of 4.5 feet (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally suspended in the air, the National Academy of Simon said that this might also be the way the transfer, and that it also had positive samples of the outside room of the people's room.
Some of the treatments such as the tube and resusciplation of the lung (CPR) may cause the air-reptions to spread, resulting in air spread.
Although there are problems where this seed disease is also transmitted, it's very rare. The most contagious condition is when one has symptoms, while the transfer may also be very small.
And the center of the disease in Europe says that while it's not quite known for the development of this disease, one person can do the general behavior of two or three others. The virus remains on the surface for hours.
In particular, the virus has been found to be more than 30 days on plastics, and the anti- bell steel (AISI 304) and Ely over four hours on copper 99F.
However, this is depending on the temperature and temperature of the variable.
So soap and cleaning are useful if it is properly used: soap products remove and disable the virus's immune layer, still separates the virus from cover and other levels.
Other solutions, such as Benzalcoumcide and Cleroxide, are less effective. In one study in Hong Kong, the possible samples were taken between two days after bed.
In five cases of six patients, the first example of a virus was the first, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus on the second day.
The Coronios 2 hyper-CV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new breathing syndrome that was first observed in three people in Vahan's chest and hugs, which had a loss of X-ray levels in their blood and breathing problems.
All new properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the Corona family virus in nature.
Out of the human body, the virus is killed with normal soap, which is destroyed by the maintenance bubble on the floor.
Sixs are an organization that has the most impact on the Coved-19, because the transgregated virus of angitensin 2 (AE2) enters the host's rocks, which has the highest number in the Aluelars of two lungs.
"Vross is fed to link to AE2 and to enter the host's room, a special glycolonine called "Speke".
At 12% of the health care centre in Wuhan, China was found severe heart damage, which is much more common in severe disease.
The rate of heart disease and heart disease is based on the reaction of the indentation system during the development of long disease, but the damage of heart muscles may be related to the ACE2 reservators in the heart.
The ACE2 RE2s are expressed largely in the heart and share the purpose of the heart's function.
The high outbreak of the Trumbos (3%) and the trombo-ambili (25%) has been observed in the ICVID-19 patients, and may be caused by a poor predictive predictive diagnosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 tends to be a result of the ACE2 explicators, severe quantum–19 patients show signs of general immunity.
In particular, the TM-CM blankets were shown to be associated with the application of IL-6 and severe lung guidance among the patients of Coveid-19.
It is also reported in Autopsi.
The World Resolution Organization has published several test protocols for this disease.
The test standard method is the reaction to the polymorphras chain of reverse transference (RRPR).
The test is usually performed on breathing samples obtained from the amplified flu, but it may also be used or used as a biopsy.
The results are usually available within a few hours until two days.
You can use blood tests, but you need two blood samples separated from two weeks away and the results are low-term value.
China's scientists were able to separate and publish a Coronaus Soxy, so the labs around the world could be self-resolved with the reaction of the polymoral chain (CR) to detect Anton to the virus.
By 4 April 2020, the anti-flight test (which can detect active Antanate) and whether or not the person has been developed in the past, but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience has shown that its accuracy is at 60 to 70 F.
The United States Food and Dovei passed the first surveillance test on March 21, 2020 of that month's end.
It is common for the two-side glass to be distributed by the environment, e.g.
Six fillings are a strange structure (strificing the loebil blade and filling air bags) and a lung density of the symptoms of disease progress.
A little knowledge is available in the link with micro-mortic waste and coved-19.
Original pathology findings from Autopsi include:
MX: Pluurit, Emmas, outside the dinner of the heart, establishing six and Rio's people.
There are four types of breast pressure and viral hugs:
Breasts and hugs: Verm Rioi, hyperpolyplyphosis, protomatic protoms, chromatitis with the lefustitis army, and the formation of the giant room.
A severe chest and hug (Penumonia) is a massive damage to the Alolar (DAD) with an alollar prostrate.
DAD is the cause of an acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and the loss of blood XDS levels.
Delves and hugs: Reciptions in air bags and corrosions of Rio's nose.
Blood: wide nakedness in the DIC.
In order to reduce your probability of staying at home includes staying at home, avoiding going to a crowded place, washing hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, keeping a good breath and avoiding touch, nose or mouth sitting with hands.
CDC (CC) advises you to put your mouth and nose on paper when you cough or cough, and if there are no napkins available, then cough or cough.
It is recommended to maintain a hand-resolve after a cough or cough.
In order to limit the transmission of disease by non-signed people, CDC has recommended the use of cover-up in public community.
A distance reaction continues to include people being at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There's no effective do-good-to-19-year-old-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-do. Because it's not the shortest possible time to get to the WXs before 2021, there's a key issue in the Coveid-19-19s, and it's an attempt to reduce the disease, or, "Curretify the curve."
CDC continues to advise individuals to wash their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the swim, or when the hands are clearly dirty, before food or after the nose cleans, after coughing and coughing.
In addition, consumers are advised to use Alcol with at least 60 FFO, but only when soap and water are not available easily.
It is an anti-mex activity of Ethanol or ISOpropanol.
"Hedrogen Peroxide is used to help rid the Backterressis in Alcol." It's not a hand-intensive active material.
The glyserol was added as a continuity.
People are being watched with support care, which may include liquid, support, and support other vital organs.
CDC suggests that people who are suspicious of the indentation of a simple face mask use.
In this case, it may be used as a result of the loss of the body, but it may be used to handle the breathing problem, but it may still have its benefits.
The self-resolvement and a lifestyle and a healthy diet are recommended to improve the fashion system.
The epic TEDO may be effective for people with mild symptoms and early stages of Antan. The World Institute of Rights (WHO) and the Chinese National Rights Committee (Cinese Healaleth Commationion) published letters to care for people who are in the kitchens because of Kovaid-19.
Special care experts and six experts in the United States have gathered the recommendations of various agencies to a free source, i.C.
Ali April 2020, which is not special for Koved-19.
Some physicians prefer the pharmalol prescription with the destination of the symptoms of ibuprophon for early TED.
In order to reduce the risk of the virus's transfer risk, especially in the treatment environment, which may be produced by floating particles, such as pipeting and using the manual breathing system.
For true care experts who care for Koved-19 people, CDC does not use cautional measures, take care of the call and the air-transgresssing system, put a person into an air-resolver room (AIIR). CDC explains the responses of personal protection equipment during the foot of the pie.
The recommended equipment is GPE, the breathing system or face mask, the protection of the eye and medical gloves. If available, the breathing machines are preferred.
N95's breathing philosophers have been confirmed for industrial locations, but the FBI has allowed these masks to be used only for a confirmed situation (EUA).
In order to protect floating particles in the air, they are designed like dust, but their effect against a particular biological factor is not guaranteed by the use that is not mentioned on its label.
The CC use of the face saver, or the last way, is to recommend home masks when masks are not available.
Most of Coved-19 are not as serious as they need to breathe, or like, but they need a crystal of the infected.
The type of breathing aid patients with non-hydrations is now being studied on people in the kitchen, and evidence has shown that by applying a pipe with high pressure or partial air pressure can be prevented from insulation or in the breathing system.
Which of these two leads to the same advantage for those who are extremely ill.
Some datterans prefer an invasion at the time of access, because it limits the spread of an aerosol particles in most of the time (people over 60 years old and especially people who are over 80).
Many developed countries don't have enough kitchen beds, which limit the capacity of a proper system to handle the sudden number of infected people in Kovaid-19 extremely necessary to be in the kitchen.
A study in China showed that five percent of them were accepted in special care entrances, 2.3% needed an artificial breathing system, and 1.4% of them died.
In China, about 3% of the people who went to the IIU because of Koved-19.
It is more complicated when the hyper-data syndrome (ARDS) progresss in Coved-19 and the delivery of the X-ray is extremely difficult.
The vantilators, which are the number of pressure and high PEPs, are used to make the maximum flow of Xygen transmission, and at the same time to reduce the risk of lung damage associated with the breathing system and pentocarax.
The high PEP (PEEP) may not be available in the old vanalators.
The investigation of potential TEDs began in Genuri 2020, and several anti-virus pairs are seen in medical studies.
Remdiscier has been the most effective one ever since.
However, it may take a long time to build a new spices in the year 2021, but many of the goods are being tested by other means of use or have already been confirmed in advanced experiments.
The anti-vavio sauce may be tested on people with severe illness.
The World Right Organization has recommended that volunteers share in the effective testing and allowing potential flavors in cases where the person's life is serious or directly threatened, granted temporary permission to improve people's plasma use (convalencent pasma).
It is not required to show permission and effective treatment for the disease.
In Fryrey 2020, the Chinese country presented an amphithmist to deal with the disease.
The users are asked to enter their identity and name.
"This program is able to detect the "Streaming Call" and thus the potential risk of the sequential.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is not only recommended by the program itself, but also by local authorities. It is used as a large DNA analysis above the TLIX database, facial recognition technology, facial recognition tracking, and artificial intelligence to track truly Mantan, and people who are in contact with the South Correa, and Sigapur.
In March 2020, the Israeli government activated security agencies to track the information of people who suspected of Antan Crona Stand.
This takes action for the actions of the century and protection of persons who may be in contact with the citizens of Mantan.
In March 2020, Dettsche Tillkom shared a joint location with the federal agency of Jeremyni, Robert Koch Instutite, in the case of the spread of the virus.
Russia performed facial recognition to identify the rebels of the century.
"Juro Galra, a member of the Italian logic board, said that the Mabel operators' seed has been informed that "40% of people are going around anyway."
This was the last week of the last 48-hour hacks with over 42000 shareers.
The President of Allah, Cresti Caljulide, also called for creative solutions against the development of the global virus.
In the United States, people may experience problems, travel restrictions, side effects or fear.
"BBC announced that "more sociality, alone, anxiety in integrity, stress, and economic crisis are completely to harm people's mental and health."
The disease may have a period of mild and low symptoms, or even without a mark, and is similar to the disease with normal breathing problems such as a normal collapse.
It's really a little bit of normal treatment in two weeks, while in severe and serious people, it may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to the DNA of other similar viruss such as Sarus and Merus, pregnant women may be more in danger of Coved-19, except the Koved-19 DNA doesn't exist yet. In some people, Koved-19 might affect the lungs and cause the chest and the hugs.
Coved-19 in severe mantans may advance quickly to a hyper-sittic syndrome that leads to breathing, shock, or disintegration of multiple parts.
The problems related to COD-19 include the laters, clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
The blood disorder, or specific blood disorder, has been seen by a rise in protembin time, in 6F cases that were accepted into the kitchen in the health room by the sequential embolism, while the unusual function was seen in 4F of this group.
About 20 to 3% of Coved-19 people are long liver infections (terrence aminos).
According to the same report, the middle time between the beginning of symptoms and death has been ten days in the hospital's condition for five days.
However, in patients who were transferred to the ICU, it was the middle of time between hospitalization and the time of death seven days.
In a high-level study, the middle time was six to 41 days since showing the initial symptoms of the early death of 14 days.
In the study done by the Chinese National Rights Committee (NHC), men had a dying rate of 2.8 Ffs, while it was in women 1.7 FF.
The tissue analysis of the six samples after death shows the damage of the spread alvellar with the physium of physiomosis in both six.
The virus's high-interpretations have been seen in the penotops.
The image of six was similar to the acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
On 11.8 FF, the deaths reported by the National Rights Committee of China were considered to be the rate of heart damage due to the high levels of tropanin or heart arrest.
According to March, 89% of the people who have been hospitalized in the kitchens have been infected.
The estimates differ from the rate of death due to logic differences and due to the problems of mittulitis.
The lower count of the number really makes the rate of death exceed the limit.
However, the fact that death cases are caused by cases that have already been created, it can mean that the death rate is now less estimated.
Such people who are driving your dog show 1.4 times more powerful symptoms of Koveid-19 and have about 2.4 times more than necessary special care than non-interference people.
The head of Hong Kong's kitchen identified the decrease of 20 percent to 3% in capacity in a number of people who had been healed of this disease and the lung scans were evidence of the damage of the organ.
This may also lead to the post-primation document after special care.
Ali March 2020 was not clear whether or not a long-term exemption in people who were cured of this disease would result in an effective and long-term immunity.
The immunity of the lives of individuals in accordance with the behavior of Sasar Crovas is likely, but it has been reported that people who have been re-resolved after Koved-19 have been re-resolved.
It is believed to make these cases worse instead of re-integrating.
This virus is thought to have been natural and has an animal origin of the origins of your home.
The real origin is unknown, but the development of Ethan Ali Dember 2019 was a human transfer to human beings.
The first 41 confirmed Koved-19 studies published in Genori 2020 at the "The Lancet", announced the first date of the appearance of the text of 1 dember 2019.
The official documentation of the Right World Organization reported that it was the first symptoms of the disease at 8 dember 2019.
A number of standards are usually used to calculate a small rate of death.
These numbers differ from the area and over time, and according to the length of the test, the quality of the correct care system is the quality of the correct care system, the time of the checker, the time of being shot from the beginning of the spread and the population properties such as age, Gender, and the general integrity.
At the end of the 2019s, the ICD-10-10 disease dedicated U07.1 to the death disease which was confirmed as a result of SARS-CoV-2 and the U072 for the dead patients who had been confirmed to be at COCV-CV-2 without an epidemology or epidemiology to COID-19.
According to Pointton Johns Williams, the global death rate to the case is by 17 April 2020, 6.9% of F.C. (153222/240).
The numbers are different from the area. Other standards include the death rate of the VR, which shows people who were sick and died and the rate of entanglement (IFR), which shows the fact that they've actually died of disease.
These statistics are not limited to time, and they follow a particular population from Antan to the solution.
Even though not all the sick people are producing suicide, the presence of these suicides in people shows how many people they've been.
At the center of the plague in Italy, in a small town called Castegion d'Ada, from 4600 souls, 80 tons (1.7F).
In Gonlet, the virus was spread into young people's festivals, which reduced the rate of death.
In addition, the criminal integrity system has not been able to accept and prevent patients from getting tired.
In Haland, from the currency of blood donors, about 3% of people may have a wind.
:0.00% of the body has died because of CO2-19.
The effect of pandmi and the death rate associated with it is different for men and women.
The rate of death in men in studies is greater in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men was in their 50s and the distance between men and women is only in 90 items.
In China, the death rate was 8.2 F and between women 7.1.
The main reason for this difference is not known as Gendari, but behavior factors can be counted as a reason.
The ionological differences based on Genander can be less common in men's tobacco use in men and men's environments, such as blood pressure at a lower age than women, in men's feet.
In Europe, 57% of the men were manned and continue to form 72% of the people who died of Koved-19.
From April 2020, the U.S. government does not track any more DNA related to the Coved–19th generations of sexual intercourse.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Abula, AIDS, flu, and saros have different effects on women and men.
A hundred feet higher than a specific staff form women who are more likely to be placed in the virus.
"The World Organization of Truth on 11 Fryrey 2020 announced that this disease was the official name of "Coved-19" (COVID-19).
The head of the World Organization explained that CO2 is the beginning of the word "Corca", "V" is the beginning of the word "c" and "D" at the beginning of the word "F" to the English L.A., and shows the number 19 years of seeing Antan's first incident: 31 dember 2019.
The name of the virus is based on the global name-named gifts to forbid corruption, with no reference to a certain occupants (for example, China), or a particular species of animals or a group of people.
In addition, the global organization in general statement "Vorus Coved-19" is also considered to be "Vourus-19".
It usually refers to both the virus and the disease.
"In the early stages of the virus in China, the virus and the disease were shared in the names of the "Curnorus" and "Curna Vahan virus."
In Genuri 2020, according to the gift published in 2015 to give temporary protection to the disease and virus, the World Rights Organization (2019-NCoV) had a name for the disease, and a mild breath disease of 2019-nCoV.
The official names of Koved-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 F.B.
Because of the limitations of capacity in standard service chains, some digital plants are producing medical goods such as the sob nose or the Vanethator parts.
For example, when a kitchen in Italy was quickly needed by a whale and was unable to supply it, it produced a local start-up with reverse engineering on a 100-calo night.
After the early prevalence of Coved-19, conspiracy theories, false knowledge and misinformation were published in connection with the source, scale, etc., Tdvi, and sick aspects were quickly published in the intern.
It turns out that humans are capable of spreading the virus to a number of other animals.
The investigation failed to find evidence that the virus was resusciprocal in pig, duck, and choche.
It is not confirmed by the treatment of the disease.
The international research in Voxin and Doa for Coveid-19 is being performed by government organizations, scientific groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Right Organization (OLIIIIIYTTTI) started testing the effects of the four anti-virus compounds that have the longest impact on their hope.
Which vaccine is not available, but different active institutions are building the VXSSt.
Because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 to enter human rocks, previous research is useful.
It is considered to be the case of three sininizations.
At first, the goal of the researchers was to produce a resusciprocal virus.
The application of such a virus, whether disabled or dead, is the goal of the immediate response to the human body's new entanglement with Kwaid-19.
The second strategy, the suboxins, is the purpose of creating the VXin, which makes the system sensitive to certain sub-virus substances.
In the link to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is so focused on a high-level research that helps the virus connect itself to the ACE2.
The third systage (or DNA), also known as the triangulitis, is an acid-symbillinic acid (or RNA or DNA), a new entanglement to advance vaccines.
The test vaccines of each of these syndromes should be tested for exemption and effective. On March 16, 2020, the first study of a VXin clinic began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Voxin consists of an unresolved ovable ovation of a virus that causes disease.
More than 300 active clinic studies are going on at April 2020.
At this time seven trials were evaluated for the Tadvi Mereria, including four studies on the hydroxyclorkin or clarlokin.
The anti-Vavis are dedicated to the major part of China's research, an oath that nine clinic trials were taken in phase three on Redcivire in different countries in recent April.
From April 2020, there was an dynamic clinic process for the construction of Voxin Koveid-19 with the two candidates engaged.
Since March 2020, there is evidence of the effect of the Remdiscier.
The recovery of a clinic in a patient under TEDO was seen using a tender use of redives.
The third phase clinic studies in the United States, China and Italy, which used to be used for the Tedi Meliria, were studied with the early results in Pryori 2020 in China.
However, there are calls for research by researchers.
The right authorities of Coria and China recommend the use of Clerovkin.
However, the Wuhan viral Institute, while recommending the dose of a Graham, suggests that it is twice as dangerous as it can be and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FPD gave permission to use an ion of Hedrexi Clerukin and Clerkin to support the people of Koved-19s. The Chinese reaction to the 7th edition of Extreferon (interferon), Rivirin or Omniovir, was intended to use the use of the Komovir–19th-19th.
The initial DNA shows that the high dose of removinin for the control of SARS-CoV-2 is in the condition of the rest of the system.
After showing low-rescuation control of SARS-CoV-2, it has been recommended to study more in the body. The studies have shown that the initial combination of protinic protein is essential to the protinosis between the mussium 2 (TMPSSS-CV-2) to enter the SARS-CV2-CV2 seed.
The high studies of Clerukin and hydrochlorine have many limits with or without an Ostiumin, which are a barrier to the medical community to accepting and testing these treatments without a complete study. The SARS-CoV-2 does not control the situation and which role has no role in TEDO2-19.
The Cytokin storm can be a problem at the next stages of Coved-19.
There's evidence that hydroxy clerukin may have an anti-serculsive property of the website. The Tusysiumb includes a short study by the National Rights Committee of China, in the instructions of the checker.
After showing positive results in severe patients, it is under an unexpected phase 2 test on the national level of Italy.
The blood test is used in combination with the Fretin Sirm test, to detect the real nature of the Cytkin storm, to deal with such progress, which is said to cause many people's death.
Antagonist RARTT6 was confirmed by FPD in 2017, based on previous studies for the release syndrome of immune cytokin to a different cause due to the CART room.
To this day, there is no random evidence or controlary evidence that the water is an effective method for CRS.
The transfer of the self-resolved anti-frequencys and anti-frequents gathered from the immune system such as Koved-19 is indeed under investigation right now as a non-sympathetic method.
It was tested for Sarus without certain results.
A virus-proving mechanism is a predictive operating mechanism with its seed, the self-intensive self-servation can create a defense factor against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as Sytotox City and/or Fagostosis are also possible.
Other types of disabled suicide wind, example, are developing the use of artificial monoloonal suicides.
The production of my garlic from honest people, including the blood blood flow from the healed patients, includes the specific anti-virus of this virus, can increase faster to use faster.
The disease caused by Cronos, a group of very connected syndromes.
Lee Vanliang, a doctor in the Central House of Wuhan, later became a part of the spread of the virus and passed away.
