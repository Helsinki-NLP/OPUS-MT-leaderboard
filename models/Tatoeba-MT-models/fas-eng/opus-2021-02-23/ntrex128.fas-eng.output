The House of Wells is concerned about being seen as a puppet.
Among some members of the Parliament there are concerns about the offer of changing their title to the MWP (MWP member of the Parliament of Wells).
This concern is due to plans that have been designed to change the name of Parliament to Parallman Wells.
The House members of every political spectrum are concerned that this makes them ridiculous.
A member of the House of Wells says that his band is concerned that "MWP" is also a translation with TWP and PWP.
In Wells, twp is an idiot and pwp, which means shit.
A member of the Plyid Party says that the group is generally not called "nowhere" and has suggested other options.
A member of the Wise Party of Wells says that his group acts on the change of the name "soundness," but also points to the fact that the "MWP" is close to the word "muplet" or "streaming tent".
In this case, the first letter of Wells is "w" similar to the letter "u" in English.
The House Committee, who has now created the rule of change of name, says: "Of course, the final decision on any title that members of the House are called is important to themselves."
The 2017 rule of Wells has given the House of Wells the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public opinion of suggestions in which the Parliament of Wells was widely supported.
On the issue of the title for members of Parliament, the commission is more likely to be used as "The Parliament of Wells" or WMP", but it has been supported by the MWP option in more general opinion.
The members of the House apparently offer alternative options, but the effort to reach an agreement can cause trouble to the president of the Elin Jones meetings, because he is expected to make the rules about these changes in a few weeks.
The reform Act includes other changes in the way the House works, the laws regarding the members of the House’s authority and the design of the committee.
After Parliament negotiations, members of the Parliament vote their final vote on the title they will be called.
The people of Macedonia go to the vote box for everyone asking if they can change the country's name.
The pollers will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the North Macedonian Republic.
The vote of the people is in line with the invitation to solve several decades of conflict with the neighbor of Greece, one of the provinces of Macedonia.
He has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor of the country represents the claim of his kingdom and has often objected to the proposal to join Macedonia in the European Union and evil.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed all questions and said that he wouldn't take this vote.
However, everyone's fans, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Naff, believe that the change in the name of the price to join the European Union.
The bell of St. Martin's Church has been shut down like a struggle.
Mr Adams: Historically, the old men I talked to about said there was always once a drink and a church in every corner."
"There is none here today."
Mr Adams says it's understood to be gone.
He says, "Today people's community goes differently."
"There are times no more neighborhoods where people go regularly."
In the case of church, he's worried that money from selling property didn't last until the leaders expected, "And sooner or later, they're going back to the beginning."
He adds that apartment buildings may be replaced by church where residents do not support the sacred space of the neighborhood.
He says, "The fact that people in these buildings are about to buy apartments, they're white, and they're going to throw ahead the day church is closed, because it's unlikely that most of these people who are moving into these apartments are going to join these churches."
Both churches were created by the Metropolitan Society in 1870 and Martin's Church a decade later by the White Church.
The original white congregation, which had the religious faith, left the city in the 1930s.
The black congregation that was praying nearby considered a new title for the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Church by the Reverend John Howard Johnson. This priest led the bans of the 55th street stores, which were the main street shopping in Hallham, and opposed the job of the blacks.
A fire caused a massive damage to the building, but when the residents in the neighborhood created repair plans in Johnson's father, they also ordered a bell set.
The priest David Johnson, son of Johnson's father, and successor to him in St. Martin, is proud to call this bell "the bells of poor people".
The expert who checked these bells in July called it something else called "a cultural treasure" and "a non-replaceable historical tool".
It was also believed that this was the first carlon in the world to be played by a black player, Dionio A. Lin, and 18 years ago to play a bigger carlon at the Ranceside Church.
Mr. Mayoravere believes that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been published in St. Martin over the past few months has been complex ideas of the mouth of architects and contractors, some of which have been created by church angels and others by the bishop Church.
The founders of the Prayer Room of the Church, which is composed of non-scientitarians, wrote a letter to the bishop Church in July and declared their concerns that the church church church church church was seeking to transfer its costs to the room of prayer, although the room of prayer was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some church people complain about lack of transparency from the bishop Church.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked and wounded during the dive for lobster hunting.
According to the authorities on Saturday and the beginning of the lobster hunting season in California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and was wounded.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon coast in Enciitas.
In the interview with KSWB-Video at San Diego, Chad Hamll stated that he was swimming with his friends on Saturday morning, who heard the cry of help from the boy and immediately swimd to him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamel tells me that at first he thought he was excited about taking a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, "He bit me!
"They bit me."
He said, "When he got along with the boy, his whole life was opened."
He said, "I cried that everyone would get out of the water, "It's in the shark's water."
The boy was transferred to the children's hospital in San Diego, where he was listed on a critical list of people.
It's not known which kind of attack shark has been.
Larry Gilles, the rescue captain at the media meeting, said that a shark was discovered a few weeks earlier in the area, but it turns out it was not part of the dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injury in the upper part of the area.
The authorities banned access to the sea for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Kazado to Suami in Sinitas.
Giles reminded me that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Cinsbury's collections for the British make-up market.
Synesbury is a chain store, and with the help of professional assistants in the construction equipment with the Bots, Soperdov and Debhams.
As part of the significant effort to enter the construction market of 2.8 billion pounds in the U.K., which is still growing (as the sale of fashion goods and household products) are still being tested), the shelfs of makeup equipment in 11 stores across the country, and if they succeed in the next year, they will be created in more stores.
The investment in makeup equipment that is presented as a supermarket is looking for ways to use a shelf space that was used for television, microwaves and domestic equipment.
Simonsbury said that it doubles the supply of makeup and produces it to 3,000 products, including brands such as revlon, Essie, Tovesman and Dr. PowPauw.
The ranges from L'Oreal, Myeline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with Mark's marked places, similar to that found in stores such as Bots.
There's going to be re-resolves in this perceivers, so that most of the plants are friends -- something that is widely followed by young buyers.
In addition, the Frgance perfume store will also have an exclusive test at the two Synesbury stores, which will open the first store last week in Creadon, South London, and the second store in Seli Ok, Brmingham, late this year.
Buy online and change in buying low food in local available stores daily means that supermarkets have to do more than enough to convince people to check on these stores.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sievesbury, says that sales markets are generally more like chain stores, and the supermarkets are trying to fight with more services and non-intervestable materials against Aldi and Leddell's discounts.
Siinsbury has created several Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats, because two years ago, both bought a chain store and said that it has strengthened the sale of food and made it more profitable.
The previous market effort failed to add makeup and pharmacies.
In the early 2000s, Simonsbury tried to create a joint company with Bots, but after an effort not too serious, they were in trouble about how the income was divided in the chemical store and the cooperation was cut off.
The new strategy took place three years ago when Synesbury sold his 201 drug store to Celsio, owner of the Loids chain pharmacy for $11 million.
It was said that by adding a wide range of luxury marks in the field of skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores, the design would play an important role.
Paul Mills Hix, a business manager of Synesbury, says: "We changed appearance and emotion in the pages of makeup products in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We also hired special and trained colleagues who will be there for advice.
The spectrum of signs, given the need and the comfort environment means that we now have a beautiful, guided place that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones turned off 11 million pounds after Holly Willobi turned down the deal.
Peter Jones, an actor of the DeGons Dan, left the meeting angryly after the TV editor, Holly Willub, broke up 11 million pounds with his commercial names, and decided to leave his new contract with Marks and S.S.R.R. and I.A.
Willobi has no time for home clothes and side aids, called "Tolley."
The couple's business is similar to the name "Gytenth Pathrow" Goop.
The editor of "Today" in Instagram announced that he had left this deal.
Holly Willobi made Peter Jones angry because at the last moment, she quit the deal with her popular business name -- to focus on new contracts with Marks and S. S.I.E.
Sources say Jones is angry when the blonde girl in her business office in Marlo, Bokinghamshire, took her new transactions with value to about 10 million pounds -- which means she doesn't have enough time for a commercial name that's working on home and side clothes.
The business was similar to the business called Gydenth Pathrow's Goops, and it is said to increase the wealth of Willubi, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds.
In this way, the 37-year-old Wilubi announced that he had a break-up with Trily and that Jones had left England to one of his home.
One of the sources said, "Toroly was really one of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to be his long-term future and be together in the next few decades.
His decision to hang up was completely confused.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, until the start of work was almost done.
"There's a warehouse full of goods in the Mülo headquarters that's ready to sell."
The experts believe that the exit of the "day" program, which is one of the most important stars in England, can lead to millions of damage because of the heavy investments in products including Kossain and candles to normal and home clothes.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
He was married to his wife and his mother, and his husband Don Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Cap.
In March, he worked as a board of directors, and he was a member of the company's company with the Cup in 2016.
These two couples were together, and 40 percent of Baldwin's television company was owned by Jones.
Willobi wanted to become an American commercial ambassador, replaced by Anthony McPatlin, who was the editor of the IVI program, "I am a Loserity".
A source close to Jones last night said, "We won't comment on his economic affairs."
It's a hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He paid attention to the news media to write an opinion that some don't think it's "resolved" and that he doesn't think of North Korea to be positive about the leader of the North Korea, and he's making fun of them.
Why does President Tromp leave things so quickly?
Tromp says with the voice of his funny kind:
"I have not forsaken anything."
He mentioned that Kim was having fun with Tromp in June after the first meeting in North Korea in June, and this was a big step to disarm the North Korean nuclear weapon.
But nuclear disarmion negotiations have stopped.
For more than three months after June's meeting in Singapore, Ray jung-ho, the senior North Korean diplomats to the world's world leaders in the United Nations said, "The North Korea does not see the parallel action from the United States to promote weapons in North Korea.
He mentioned that instead of the United States, he continued to ban with the aim of maintaining pressure.
He had a very good view for his fans.
He said, "We did great with North Korea."
"We were going to war with North Korea.
In that case, millions of people would have been killed.
But now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim had brought positive results -- ending missile experiments, helping the hostages free and re-resolging the bodies of American forces to the country.
And he also defended his unusual approach in talking to Kim about relationships.
It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside this space trying to get themselves into this compact space, we have about 200 people standing there.
Sonami Indonesia and earthquake destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after Lombo earthquake, it was told non-state organizations that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population had been homeless, it was not announced that the national disaster that was required for international assistance quickly.
Ms. Sambong says, "I'm afraid in many cases, it's very clear that the demand for international assistance is not done, and so it's a little difficult."
While children's rescue group is gathering a team to travel to Palo City, they are not sure if foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sototototoo, the National Agency's Secretary, says that Indonesia's authorities are investigating the situation in Palo to see if they can allow international organizations to help.
Despite the movement of the Earth that is constantly happening in Indonesia, this country is unfortunately not quite ready for nature's anger.
There are no shelters on the coasts of the Sonami shelters.
The lack of alarm to Sonami's alarm in Palo or even a normal warning was also one of the causes of casualties.
In the best case, moving between many Indonesian islands is a challenging job.
The natural disasters make the supplies harder.
A hospital ship that was set up in Lombo to treat earthquake eye damage is on the way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to get to the scene.
President Jacko Weddo took steps to improve the old Indonesian substrates of his campaigns and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Jacko's government's lack of budgets will have a problem in the election next year.
Mr. Jacko's face is also faced with the pressure of sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where the majority of the Muslim people have accepted a conservative form of religion.
Christian gangs and Muslims die in the streets using bows, bows, spear, and other violent weapons that kill over 1,000 people and tens of thousands of homeless people.

I'm also going to ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers who may have recorded reports on their glove, to call us because their information may be critical for our research."
The police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered lived in the Berkenhed neighborhood and was found inside the house.
This afternoon, a woman's friends who know her have been asked to come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.

Cromwell's statue is the oldest memory ever to be hit by the "Developing History".
Its exile is a romantic justice for the Taliban to destroy many of the cultural and religious works of England, which have been done by followers of the Piortin religion.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's offer as "stupid" and "attempting to rebuild history".
John Goldsamite, president of the Cromwell Society, said, "Now it is inevitable to discuss the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statues outside West Miester's palace.
The destruction of civil war in England was neither an order nor an order.
Perhaps the opposition to the law and the actions of Thomas was sacrificed in the past century.
The glorious display that William Myrmorcroft of Cromwell has presented is evidence of the 19th century's beliefs and part of the history of a character that many believe is still adorable.
Mr. Goldemit said to Sydney, "Kermwell was considered to be a defender of foreign pressure by many people who may have been more likely than today in the late 19th century.
Whether this is a very precise display, it's a historical ongoing discussion.
What we trust is that in the middle of the 17th century, the conflict formed the next development process of our nation and Cromwell is a well-known character that represents the division on one side.
His works are also worth praise and memorial service as Lord's support."
A killer pig with Poe killed the Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed in a market in South China.
According to the South China newspaper, this man was found known only by his last name Yuvan, who was cut off by blood and was found near a pig on the streets of Leipan, in Gojo.
On May 30, 2005, and in the Jings Province of China, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs in swine.
According to the report, he entered the city on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbor's province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he was dead and that he was a neighbor's pig's door.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pig's pig, with blood on his mouth.
According to this report, the legal examination confirms that the pig attacked the farmer with 250 pounds and killed him.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and broken."
The security cameras show that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed this man doesn't belong to him or his uncle's son.
One of the market managers told the afternoon newspaper that this pig was tied up to prevent people from attacking, and at the same time the police collected evidence from the scene.
It has been reported that the Yuan family and the market officials are discussing the compensation of his death.
It was already recorded from a pig attack on humans, although it was a rare matter.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm and caused severe damage to a man.
Ten years ago, a 290-pound pig had struck a Wellsian farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal and threw it away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a mantuba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
He said, "The pigs are just playing.
They bite and they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to respect them properly."
The rest of Rose's storm caused heavy rain in South America.
As predicted, the rose storm has been weakened because of moving on the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and South America.
Its location is 620 km south of Ponta Eugnia, Mexico, with a wind of 137 miles per hour at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure waves start to form on the Pacific Ocean and move east and west coast of the United States.
Rosa makes it rain on Monday in parts of Mexico to 250 mm.
In the future, the heating water in interaction with low pressure waves will cause heavy rain in the South.
The rainfalls of 25 to 100 mm of rain in a position resulting in dangerous floods, the water flows along with waste and possibly the earth's collapse.
In some places, the high-resistant continuity continuity in the southern part of Arizona and Arizona will increase to 50 to 75 m per hour.
It is expected in parts of the South, especially in many districts of Arizona, about 50 to 100 mm.
According to the nature of the spread of hot rain, sudden floods occur, and the situation is going to get worse.
According to the risk of rainfalls, it is highly recommended to avoid walking on the plain.
The heavy rain will cause deep valleys to turn into deep rivers, and the storm will blow with dust.
The current waves will cause severe local rainfalls in parts of the South California coast.
The rainfall is more than 12 mm, which will cause the water flow along with the waste and the collapse of the roads.
This will be the first rain in the wet season.
The spread of hot rain takes place at the end of Sunday and early Monday in Arizona, which will be extended at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The shower of rain will come on Tuesday to the Fre Corners and it will continue until Wednesday.
In October we witness severe temperature changes throughout the United States, because the North Pole cools, but the heat zones remain very warm.
Sometimes this situation leads to significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday, an excellent example of temperature difference will occur in the entire central part of the United States.
Almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omass from the state of Hamburg and St. Louis and De Moynes from Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the late summer will remain and it will rise again.
Many of the central and eastern parts of the United States have warm days in early October, and in the southern plains to the northern parts of the air temperature to 27 degrees.
On Tuesday, New York City temperatures may reach 27 centigrade, which will be about 6 degrees higher than average.
The weather conditions in the first half of October show the probability of higher temperatures in the east of the United States.
There were over 20 million audiences at Bert Kavano's hearing.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people witnessed evidence in the Supreme Court of State by Christine Blyford about the sexual assault of Bert Kavano, who claimed to have happened in the 1980s.
In the meantime, political opposition continued and the broadcast of normal television programs was cut off until Friday's final moment: a contract that Senator Arizona Juff Flick designed with the FBI to investigate charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate committee that he was 100 percent sure that Crano had been drunk and tried to take off his clothes at the high school party.
Kavano says 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is possible that on Friday, over 20 million people watched this incident reported by Nielsen.
The company has counted the average number of audiences in CBS, ABS, NBC, CNN, FX News, and SMNBC.
The numbers were not available for other networks that showed this event, including PBS, C-SPAN, and FX's commercial network immediately.
Nielsen is usually unable to count the people who were watching the program.
To imagine the subject, it is almost equal to the audience of a football game or an Oscar award.
Nielsen said Fox News, who had highly supported Kavano's appointment, had an average of 5.6 million views that were ahead of all other networks.
ABC had a second position with 3.26 million views.
According to Nielsen CBS, NBC, SNNN and CNNN were based on 3.1 million, 2.8 million, 289 million and 22 million views.
The audience's interest continued after the hearing.
Flick played the main role in Friday's play.
After the U.S. office announced that he would vote for Kavano's benefit on Friday, the CNN and CBS cameras showed him that he was going to court elevators between the opposition.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes while others blamed him, and this scene was released live from CNN.
A woman said, "I stand right before you."
"Do you think he tells the truth to the people of the country?
The man said, "When many women are weak, you are powerful."
Flick said that his office made a statement and said that before the elevator was closed, he wanted to say more at the committee's hearing.
The cable networks and the broadcast of the program were covered when the committee was voting for Kavano's candidate in the Senate.
But Flick said that he only did this by understanding that the FBI was being accused of being engaged for the next week by the Islamic Union.
Flick was somewhat convinced after talking to his friend Chris Coves, who is a democratic senator.
After a conversation with Queens and some other senators, Felix decided to.
Flick's choice had power, because it was clear that the Republicans couldn't vote without research to confirm Kaana.
President Tromp asked the FBI to start his investigation on charges against Kaana.
The British Prime Minister accused the critic of "the political game" in Braggsite.
In the interview with the Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Teresa said that the idea of exiting the European Union is about to play political games with the future of Britain, causing a blow to national interests.

In his interview with the papers, Boris Johnson, former Foreign Minister, spoke of his attack on the Czechrs for the Brexette, suggested that the British and the European Union should collect their "resolves" altogether.

Police are about to celebrate the anniversary of the vote for independence.
On Saturday, six people were arrested during the campaign with the anti-consurgency police in Barcelona, and when thousands of people joined the campaign to hold the first anniversary of the separation of Catlonia.
A group of anti-sermist cops began to throw eggs and powdered paints that caused the dark clouds of dust to come out of the streets, which was usually accompanied by a crowd of tourists.
When the police surrounded the protestors by Batum, the protests again arose.
For more than a few hours, independence's fans joined the ranks with "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in front of the allies who cried out, "Keep the Spanish Long."
Local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor damages.
The tensions are still a year since October 1, which Madrid considers illegal, but the anniversary is celebrated by separate parties.
The polls decided to completely separate, although the number of candidates in the election was low, and the opposition had banned the vote.
According to the authorities, in the last year after the police tried to stop voting around the area, about 1,000 people were injured in violent conflict.
On Friday, the members of the National Police Department were able to stop the protests from supporting the National Police.
The fake people went ahead, but they had to choose another way.
He said that he would no longer expect the expectations of Katalonia to be granted independence.
Last year we spent one of the best moments of our life.
I watched my parents cry out with enthusiasm, because they could vote, but now we're dead."
Despite the management of that vital victory in the last December, the party of the Kotala independence parties failed to continue their movement in the current year, many of their famous leaders are in exile or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in the Remunium and the declaration of independence.
Juan Poig, who is a 42-year-old mechanic and films under police protection from protests, said that the difference between politicians and politicians has reached a dead end.
And he said, "There's more and more teeth."
On Saturday, Oriol Johncoras, one of the nine leaders of Katala, who has been under temporary arrest since last year, announced that he will be running the European Parliament election in the next year.
He said, "To be nominated for the European Parliament election is the best democratic way to condemn the re-resolves and re-resolves that we've seen from the Spanish government."
Londondari: During the destruction of a house in a car, some men were arrested
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after driving their car to a house in London in London.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19:30 in Balingard Crest.
Detective Bob Belling said it was damaged by the doors and the building itself.
In some places, it is also shot by a bow in a car.
The Mega with his flower led Livingston to victory over the Rangers.
The first Dol-Manga flower guarantees this team's victory for Livingston.
He was a member of the club, and he was a member of the club, and he was a member of the club.
The Dalai Manga flower led Livingston to the Balgi Grey Hall above Highbornian.
The team won no victory outside the home this season, playing with the Hertz team, which has eight points, will be on Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will be hosted at the European League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston went on to increase his inability to play six games with the coach you've replaced last month.
Livingston lost his chance against his guest.
The Holt team worked aggressive before it reached the flower, and their direct kicks caused the Rangers trouble.
Scott Robinson broke the line of defenders, but his efforts were useless against the flower, so Alan Litigoff was able to only throw him back into the mud to get to the water.
The host was happy to play against the Ranger team, and they knew that they could get the other team into trouble in parts of the game.
And so they were able to hit that vital flower.
Lingston took a shot, the ball reached Manga in between the Galcher and Robinson, and he drove the ball through the middle of the field.
By then, Rangers owned the ball, but the defense of the host's team was inconsistent, and it worked primarily without a mistake.
The process continued in the second half, although Liam Kelly was able to control Alfred Morlos' ball.
Scott Peterman was stopped by Alan McGuror, Bon Ranger's gate, and Lightgate was struck by a foot out for Livingston.
The side effects were constantly hit to the Lingston account, but they were all dismissed. The Rangers claimed twice -- once after the error on the Golden Mayton replacement player and one because of contacting the ball with the hand.
"The Great Work of Lingston" - analysis.
Alsdair Lamott, Scotland B.C. reporter from Toby Maccaroni's stadium.
The performance and the great outcome for Livingston.
They were so great to me, they still appeared better than expected.
The game style and its men have changed very little after returning to the peak, but the main honor is to wear it after entering the team.
He had many heroes.
The captain was great, and he organized the defense very well, at the same time he was able to defeat Conator Goldsan and Joe Veral.
Although the Rangers didn't like it.
As good as they were in Gerald's time, they're now getting away from these standards.
They didn't have the final terminal -- they were able to open up the host's defense once -- and this is a warning for Rangers who are now in the middle of the table.
A double welcome to the camp in Calden.
On Saturday (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany met with a smile in the blue sky of Berlin.
This is the last debated day of President Campan's meeting in Germany, where it is intended to correct relationships with the Islamic Union.
They negotiated about human rights issues, the freedom of press and Turkey's members in the European Union.
Then the camps went to Colon to open a new and very large mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkeys outside the country.
For security reasons, the police prevented the population from gathering in front of the mosque, but many fans gathered near the mosque to see their president.
There were hundreds of protestors -- many of them -- began to motto, and condemned the strategy of warrs and the decision of the German government to accept him in this country.
The protests of the two opposite groups represent the slander between the two Turkish Turks of Germany, some of whom are known to be a hero, and others say evil to him as ruler.
The road accident at D.T.R.: A bicycle ride died in a car accident.
A bike ride died dealing with a car in London.
The crash in the southeast of the city, near the corner of Blockwood and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in D.T.R., took place around 10:15 p.m.

The prison officials of Long Lartin: Six agents were injured during the riot.
According to the prison office, six prison agents were wounded for chaos in a high-level prison.
The riot took place at HMP Letin in Westershire at 9:30 p.m. on Sunday and still continues.
The officers of the Toradano have been involved in combating chaos, which contains eight prisoners, in a surrounded corner.
The officers were treated due to minor injuries.
A prison service speaker said, "The trained workers have been placed to deal with possible events at HMP Lettin.

We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's obvious that the authorities are entrusted to the police, and they may spend more time behind bars."
It has more than 500 prisoners, and many of them are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden was transferred to the hospital after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, anti-consurgency officers were called to prison to deal with a serious riot.
A sudden storm threat by the Roza storm in Phoenix, Vegas and New York City.
It's rare to reduce the pressure to Arizona, but that's exactly what's happening in the early weeks, which means that the remaining energy of the rose storm will pass past the Western desert and risk the sudden flood.
The National Weather Service for Mondays and Tuesdays, west of Arizona and east of California, east of California and S.H.I.E.L.L.D., including Phoenix, F.S.F., Las Vegas, and New York City.
It is predicted that Rosa turns her way to Phoenix on Tuesday, where at the end of Monday, it will cause the rain to rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reminded us through a single message: "From 1950, only 10 hot winds have caused a sterilic storm or low pressure situation about 320 miles from Phoenix!
It was a storm of about 65 miles [ 65 km] from the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Storm Center predicted that 50 to 100 mm rainfalls, which is also at Mogollon Rim Arizona.
In other areas of the Western desert, including the central mountain of Rocky and the large water pool, most likely will rain 25 to 50 mm, which may also be to 100 mm.
For areas that are far from the dangers of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa may benefit because these areas are suffering from droughts.
Although the flood of anxiety is very serious, it's probably useful for some of these areas, because the South Side is experiencing drought conditions right now.
According to the drought surveillance centre and the Web site, more than 40 percent of the districts of Arizona are in severe drought conditions, which are second in a high degree.
At the beginning of the storm, Rosea is headed towards the night of the island of Baja, California, Mexico.
Rose is still at one storm, and Sunday morning was at the maximum speed of the wind of 137 miles an hour, 620 km south of Ponta Eugnia, Mexico, moving north at 20 miles an hour.
The storm continues to meet colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and thus reduces its power.
Therefore, it is expected that in the afternoon or Monday night in Mexico, a hot storm would show its power.
In various parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe, and the risk of flood is significant.
To the report: "All the weights from Baja California to the north is 75 to 150 mm, which may also reach 150 mm."
Rose then moves north as a hot storm from Mexico, and in the early hours of the morning, the heat pressure reaches the border of Arizona, and in the late Tuesdays, after crossing Arizona, it will move south of evil.
Reporting to the National Center of the Storm: "The main danger of the prophecy foretold by Rosa and its remains includes extreme rainfalls in Baja California, North Soura and South America."
These showers are expected to create sudden floods and threaten life in the desert and stumble the earth into the mountains.
The attack at Mead Summerton: Four suspects were arrested for attempted murder.

Police officers have requested persons who may have recorded a video of what happened on the phone to see the police.
Tromp says Kavano is upset with the Democratic Party's post and anger.
In his speech in Weilings, West Virginia said, "The vote for Judge Cunno is a vote for the rejection of the tyrant and the cruel tactics of the Democratic Party.
He said that Kavano was upset with the Democratic Party during his engagement process.
Before Congress's meeting on Thursday, Kavano announced that he strongly refused to claim to have sexual intercourse with Christine Blyford, who claims to have raped Kavano several decades ago and during his youth.
Ford also testified at the hearing meeting about his claim.
On Saturday, President Tromp said that "the American people saw the light and the courage of Kavano" on that day.
He told many of his fans in West Virginia: "Roy, to the approval of Judge Kavano, to vote as one of the most famous legal experts in our day, who is a full-time legal expert in public services."
While talking about the importance of the presidential partnership in the middle-time election, the president was sorely referring to Kavano.
"The five weeks remain one of the most important elections in our lives.
He said, "I'm not around the election, but I'm actually."
"That is why I am in this place, and I fight for great candidates."
The Trimp claimed that the democratic mission was "a resistance and a barrier".
A senior consultant told CNN that the first vote in the Senate was to be done by Kavano's candidate until Friday.
Hundreds were killed in the earthquake and the Indonesian Sonamy, and the casualties seemed to increase.
On Saturday, authorities announced that due to the earthquake and the great Solusi island of Indonesia, at least 384 people were killed and a huge wave took many people on the shores.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathered to attend a festival on the coast of Palo, and suddenly, at sundown, he took a lot of high-five feet (18 feet) and drowned them and destroyed everything that was on his way.
It was the last earthquake in the world.
Sotopo Peorvo Nogiro, a member of the Indonesian Respiration Organization at a press conference in Jakarta, said, " Yesterday when Sonami's threat occurred, people didn't stop working on the beach and run off immediately, and so they were sacrificed."
No group said, "Sunami, who came to the cars, took the fields and the houses and destroyed everything on the ground, added that Sonami, before reaching the coast line, sails at 800 miles [4 km] an hour [4 km].
He said that some people went up and lived to escape Sonami.
About 1600 people were removed from their homes and were given at 24 centers in Palosan.
Air photos published by the National Organization show that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges have been wrapped together and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the earthquakes continued in this beach city.
This series of earthquakes in a region with 2.1 million populations.
In a statement that the energy published by the Big earthquake had about 200 times as much power as the Hishima nuclear bomb in World War II.
It is said that the city's occupants, which are at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have raised the size of the sonnami.
He described the damage of the group as "extinence" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the broken buildings, and that over 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
Noo said that the damage and damage along the coast line could be more than 300 miles north of Paulo, a region called Dongala, near the center of the earthquake.
The group said, "The communications are completely cut off and there is no information about Dongala.
The Red Cross announced that over 300 thousand people lived there, and that employees and volunteers of the organization were sent to areas.
It's said, "It's a disaster, but it could be much worse."
The agency was critical on Saturday because he didn't notice that Sonami was approaching Paulo, but the authorities announced that the waves had reached the beach at the time of the notice.
In amateur films shared in social media, a man's voice is heard on the top floor of a building, which gives loud warning of the approaching Sonami approach to people down the street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water fell off the beach and took the buildings and cars.
It was not immediately confirmed by Rotters.
The earthquake and Sonami caused the power and communication around Paulo and the job of the authorities to adapt the rescue operation.
The authorities have said that the military has tried to send help from Jakarta and other cities, but homeless people still need food and other basic provisions.
The city’s airport is open only to help with relief efforts and is closed to other cases by October.
President Jacko Vido visited the housing centers in Palo on Sunday.
The number of victims of Sonami in Indonesia increased to over 800.
It's too bad.
Mr. Dasba said that Verlde Vision's employees were safe from Dongella, in the city of Palo, and that employees had set up tent shelters in their office yard and were in the process of destruction.
And he said, They said, Many houses are desolate.
It's too bad.
While the relief groups have started their move to reduce disaster with available tools, some are complaining that they are preventing foreign aid forces with high expertise to palo.
According to Indonesia's laws, financial supply, resources and human power from abroad can only be declared in the disaster zone of national disaster.
But this announcement hasn't happened yet.
"This event is still a disaster on the surface of the province."
"When the government accepts it, it can be declared a national disaster. In that case, it will be opened to international aid, but it still doesn't exist."
In spite of the two nights of earthquakes and sunmi Friday at Paulo, friends and families of those who have gone missing still hope that a miracle will come about their loved ones and change the story of this natural disaster.
A boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the relief forces saved a woman who was trapped under the porch and spent two days with her mother's body.
Goon Soblono, the national team coach of Paraglei in Indonesia, has lost two athletes who had been trained for Asian games.
Other people who were trapped in the visa hotel included Mr. Mandagi and his students.
He said, "As a senior coach in the Paraglydre field, I suffer a lot of emotional pressure."
Mr. Garlon made it clear that a few hours after the crash of the S.P.G.R.A.R.R., he was worried about his disciples and sent messages to the Paraglydres through the Watsap to the competitors at the Palo Beach Festival.
However, instead of a pair of blue tick marks, his messages only received a gray tick mark.
He said, "I think the gray tick means they weren't delivered."

Kenny West: The rap singer who changed his name to Ye
The raper of Kenny West changed his name to Y.
He announced this change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote, "My official name is Kenny West."
West 41 was named after Ye for a while, and he used it for his eighth album released in June.
It was announced before his presence on Saturday night, and he announced that he would soon make his new album "Yandhi".
The producer announced that he was replaced by Arena Grand, the former singer, who canceled it to "The Heart of the Heart".
He was a professional name for West, and he said that the word was important to him.
In the early years, West said in the interview with Big Boy's radio program about his album: "I believe "y" is the word most used in the Bible that means you.
"That I am yours. I am ours and ours.
To name your name, which means lonely, I'm going to change to ye so that there's a sense of good, evil, and confusion of us and everything.
This album is more than the reflection that we are."
He is one of several famous rap readers who has changed his name.
For example, Saan Cobs is known by various names "P.D.D.D. or Deady", but in the current year he announced that he was more likely to call himself Love and Bree Love Love".
The former partner of West is also known as JAY-Z with or without dark lines, big and small.
AmLO, the President of Mexico has promised not to use military against civilians.
Andres Manuels Oberdor, the president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians at the same time as near 50th anniversary of student blood massacre.
Lupes Oberdor promised in the House of Taltolco on Saturday, "He never uses the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
During the peaceful protest that was held on October 2nd, 1973, while left student movements were growing across Latin America, soldiers were killed on the people of the fire, 300 people were killed.
Lupus Oberdor has been committed to support the young Mexican youth by giving monthly support to those who are studying and opening government universities.
According to him, unemployment and education failures will lead young people to crime groups.
The United States must double the resources of artificial intelligence (AI).
Kai Fo Lee, an investment and active AI, who works on Google, Microsoft and Apple, says: As China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States must double the investment for research.
It was then announced that different parts of the U.S. government published statements about AI, and that the United States generally lack a formal strategy about AI.
While China announced it last year, their goal was to be in the first place until 2030.
Lee said, "It's going to be a good start to double the AI research budget, considering other countries are far away from the United States, and we're looking for further progress in AI."
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double investment can double the chances of the success of the AI in the future of the United States.
Lee is the author of the "AI Powers of artificial intelligence: China, the New World Order" book published by Helton Mufflin Harquet, who is the CEO of the Sinvest Went Company, which has been invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, China, called "Free+".
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnigi Melon on a AI system that was able to beat Othlo's game hero in the United States. He later became CEO of Microsoft and head of Google branch in China.
Lee appreciates the technology competition that was held in the former U.S. government, such as the robot challenge that was done by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects and asks for similar cases in the future to help know the next dream.
Lee says that researchers in the United States often work hard to get government aid.
Lee said, "It's not China that's where the researchers have taken the university; it's the companies that do it."
Facebook, Google, and other perishable companies have hired academics to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that moving policy can also help the United States to strengthen her efforts in the AI field.
He says that I think people with a doctor in AI should automatically give them a green card.
The Chinese State Council published its next generation's artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
According to Lee, the National Institute of Sciences of China is a financial aid to people in academic institutions, which is like what the National Institute of Sciences and other government organizations do for U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work is lower in China.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a joint artificial intelligence center that aims to create cooperation between industry and university, and the White House announced the formation of an artificial choice committee.
And this month, DARPA announced two billion dollars investments in a design called AI Next.
And in the case of NSF, it's already invested over 100 million dollars in the AI investigation.
But it is seen that the United States law that sought to create a national security committee in the field of artificial intelligence has not worked very much in the past months.
The people of Macedonia in one question declare whether the fathers want to change their country's name.
The people of Macedonia take part in one question on Sunday and vote for their country's name to be changed, a movement that would lead to a few decades of conflict with Greece because it has prevented this country from joining in the European Union and evil.
Greece, which has a station called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name shows some kind of claim to the territory of the country and has entered Macedonia and the European Union.
The two governments agreed on the new name in June, but the opposition of the Nagrastism believe that this change will weaken the identity of the majority of Slavi Macedonia.
The President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in all questions and that the sanctions of all questions have come to doubt whether the number of votes is at least 50 percent required to be trusted.
The question that is written on the vote papers is, "Do you agree to accept a deal with Greece and a member of the European Union?"
Recognizing supporters, including the Prime Minister of Goldmanif, believe that the cost must be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that result in the collapse of the U.S. and above.
"Eliura Georgesovka, who lived in Scoapolis, said, "I'm here today to vote for my country's future, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union, because our lives will be safer."
The members of Parliament have announced enough that they will stand up to the outcome of the election, although it is not legally necessary.
The name required the majority of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The Stanian election committee has announced that by 1 p.m., there is no report of violations of the law.
However, the number of candidates in all of the questions did not go beyond 16 percent, while in the recent election of the Parliament in 2016, there were about 66 percent of the brand-in-law voters in the election.
"I voted for my children, our place is Europe."
On September 30, 2018, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoranif, his wife, and his son, Dasko, cast their vote into the box to open the country to join Nato and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Scoppie, and the 400-year-old Ladomir Kadarkov prepares a small platform and puts seats in front of tents that have been set up by the banned people of the question.
Kadarkov says, "We belong to Nato and the European Union, but we want to join them with dignity, not through the back door."
"We are poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can go back to others like China and Russia and be part of the united society of Europe and Asia."
The Prime Minister says that it has a lot of investment in Nato, which is more than 20 percent of the unemployment rate.
After the vote, Zapoff said, "I believe that most people are fans of this because over 80 percent of our citizens want the European Union and Nato."
He said, "Yes, it will confirm our future."
The poll that was published last Monday by the Macedonian political research Institute shows that between 30 and 43 percent of those who are qualified to take part in all the questions -- that's less than just advice.
Another poll done by Tellma Maveni TV shows that 57 percent of the responders are going to vote on Sunday.
These 70 percent say they'll vote yes.
In order to succeed, all questions are required at 50 percent plus one vote.
In all of Percy's failure is the first serious impact on the Western government policy that took power last May.
Watch: Sergio Augero, the Manchester City player, passes through all of your defenses and leaves the ball.
On Monday at the Manchester Union stadium, Sergio Schwarero and Mercy Stirling broke up your defense to make Manchester City win two against zero.
In 65 minutes, he put the ball into the front gate.
In the beginning of the beginning, Argentina's attacker received part in the middle line.
He went through three defenses and opened space to himself.
He then saw himself surrounded by four green players.
He moved around with his moves on the edge of the fine yard.
Then he passed on to his left, and he arrived at Stirling.
The English flash shot the ball back into the yard, and he hit the ball with his right foot, and Matthew Ryan beat the door of the baton, and hit the ball on the right side of the gate.
Pep Guadola, head of the City team, said to the press, "Agoero is involved in certain problems in his feet."
"We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have a flower at the same time."
But it was Stirling who first worked for heavenly blues in this race.
The flower was played in 29 minutes.
In the game, Agorero received the ball deep into the concrete field.
He brought the ball to Lorena from left to left.
Before Stirling went further into the bow, Sin hit the ball a few times.
The blues of the sky will stick the ball to the net right in the gate.
==History==The City is a group of heroes at 12:55 p.m. on Saturday afternoon at Rhein-Nacar-Arena City, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as Spyler against the Rocks team.
Although the Nationals team has been removed from the Playfire competitions, they have no reason to try to start another start.
But the team is always hoping that Scherzer's opponent will play against Culodo Rocks on Sunday, but only if he has the concept of a bridge for the Rocks, which has played a game more than the Loss Anges Dodgers in the National League of the West.
On Friday night, Rockys won five against the Nationals at least one WWD card, but still intend to have their first title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, we can at least touch the ball, knowing what Joe's like here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level that we've ever encountered.
"Why don't I want to compete?"
The Nationals should announce a Starter to play Sunday, but it has been reported that they would like to post Scherzer.
Scherzer, who can have his 34th start, has a launch session on Thursday and normal rest on Sunday.
The number of players in Washington's right hand is 18–7, with 2.3 ERA and 300 hits in 220.3 games.
Tramp talks in West Virginia
The President of Tromp was deeply involved in the situation around the Supreme Court and Bert Kavano, and spoke of the importance of the involvement of the Republicans in the Middle Age elections.
"We will gamble all our actions in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This election is one of the biggest and great -- I'm not engaged in this election, but actually I am, because I'm here fighting for candidates."
Trump went on: "You see this terrible group, these horrible democratics, you see, these things are happening right now.
They're determined to use whatever means they need to gain power, you see the post of these and the filth of this group.
They don't care who gets hurt in this fight, who's going to stop to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we don't want to give them these two.
And he said, This is the mission of the democratics: "Agress of resistance, and a barrier."
And he said, And ye see how long they have called the democratics angry, low, unclean, and wrong for the past four days.
He referred to the U.S. Senate committee and Senator Diane Finnstein, who said how the audience had Who he had been Who he was.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you read the documents he opened out?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, I wait -- the body language that was really bad -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The working party is no longer a large church.
From those who support freedom of speech, it's impossible.
I wasn't surprised when the Momantum activists voted for me at the local party.
However, I was the last person on the line of the working party who didn't receive it -- all for freedom to speak.
Joan Ryan, my Parliament partner, had seen the same behavior, because he's highly opposed to Jewish.
In my case, my criticism was due to opposition to Jeremy Corbin.
There are similar issues about the importance of politics in terms of the economy, about national security, in return to Europe, in which there was a difference with former leaders.
In the announcement of the working party's meeting in East Natingham on Friday, it was announced that "We want meetings to be kept in check."
In the eight years I've been a local member of the Work Party, that was exactly what was on Friday night GC.
Unfortunately today, the tone is not seen in many meetings, and the promise of "more gentle and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time.
It is often seen that different views in the working party are not endured and that ideas are judged whether they can be accepted to lead the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when I used to think that I shared a similar political theory with his colleagues, they thought I was going to turn around and they had positions about national security or the European Union's private market that I never agreed with.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a very serious talk about social media abuse that wants to be no choice, condemning central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the working party.
And it didn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the ideas they give about me are political.
I'm exposed to professionalism and the determination of colleagues to face sexual abuse or racist abuse every day, but they're not ashamed at all.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time of politics is that abuse has been normal to a certain level.
Last week, Jeremy Crebin announced that the working party had to develop the culture of patience for other words.
The fact is that we're no longer a large church, and by any movement due to "consistence," or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that makes me go down, have nothing to say and just say, okay.
But that's not what I went into politics to do.
I joined the working party 32 years ago as a student of school, which was due to the encouragement of the government, which made me officially lose high school classes, and I was trying to provide a better public service for those who needed it -- it didn't matter if I joined the Council or the Minister of State.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last election.
No one in the East Natingham is confused about the political positions and the conflict pools that I have with the current leadership.
I can only tell those who encouraged this action on Friday that when the country is working hard to move towards the Bursty that harms our families, business and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the working party leader.
But really one of my messages that didn't reach Natingham Momantum, and to members of the House, it's: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of choice or political interest will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ary 38 - 17 Melrose: "Air the Almighty" went to the top.
In the final two stages, the effort may be somewhat different from the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ir was worthy of this wonderful and interesting victory at the Ragby Tennet League.
They're already at the top of the table and the only team that hasn't lost on one side.
Eventually, it was their top defense, and with the chance that they could win the host team, and Coach Peter Morechi was right to be satisfied.
He said, "We've been tested during the tournament and we haven't been defeated yet, so we should be happy."
Robin Cristy from Melrose said, "Good luck to Eyre, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Anderston's attempt was completed in 14 minutes, completed by Frieder Clymo, but a yellow card for Captain Scotland, Rory Hughes, was given to play by Warorts, and Jason Blogt did not take a non-interceptive attempt.
In the middle of the game, Clymo took Eyre's lead player with a penal shot, and before that, he produced flowers just in the middle of the game, so with a single pass, it led to 17 in the interest of Eyre.
But Melos started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to reduce the difference by passing Blogt into five points.
The game was stopped for a long time after Reardh Knot's severe injury, and after the start of the game, Estford McDoal returned the distance by the Clymo Pass.
After that, Blair McParderson took a yellow card, and he lost another player again because of Bruce Collin's hard pressure.
However, the host's team went back to the game again, and when St. Haninson got a yellow card on Clymo without a yellow card ball, McParderson went behind Eyre Tuch's attack group.
Clymo gave a quick pass, like he had started over, so he pulled Kyle into David Armstrong's yard, and the attacker took him away from the 5th of the host.
The star is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems that after it turns out that Ford Kayran, an actor, is acting as a manager of a given restaurant, he moves to the restaurant industry.
This 56-year-old man played Jack Popvis in the popular BBC series, who wrote that he worked with Greg Hamel for a long time as a comedy couple.
These two have announced that the next nine series will be the last set of this show, and it looks like the Kregans are planning their lives after Craigalang.
According to the official register list, he will be limited to the Eedermhorn manager with the money.
The actor refused to comment on this, although Scottish Sun said that Krecan was looking to enter the business of "strificons" in Glusco.
"The sea is for us."
Seaships protect the Navy base in Laupz.
In general buildings, the blue ocean flag is made up of autism.
On sea sites from Lake Titika to Amazon, the motto was seen as "The Sea is our right."
It's a task to bring it back."
All over Bolivia, without any sea, the memory of losing the coastline and delivering it to Chile, which led to a blood war in the 19th century, is still alive -- like a desire to sail in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have reached its highest limit after decades, because, after five years in court, Bolivia is waiting for an international court order on October 1.
Roberto Caldelia from Bolivia says, "Bolivi is on the move, the spirit of unity and peace prevails and is waiting for positive results."
Many Bolivian people around the country watch the IJ issue on the big screens, hoping that the Hague Court will vote for the benefit of the debate after a few decades of negotiations and force Chile to negotiate the control of Bolivia and the access to the sea.
Ove Morals, President of Carritic and local Bolivian President, who has a hard fight for re-electing the next year -- he's taking too much maneuvers on Monday's call.
At the end of August, he promised, "We'll be back in the Pacific soon."
But some expensive analysis believes that the court seems unlikely to make a decision for Bolivia -- and if it does, it's going to be with a little change.
The United Nations Court, whose seat is in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant part of the Chilen land, and has claimed that the vote cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations.
Pz Zawart, an international rights expert in Chile, said that the IJ court order was only declared six months after the arguments were heard that the case was not "continueded."
And far away from Bolivia's extra continuity, four years ago, it might be returned.
Zárate said, "The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian government."
He believes that the moments of Morals' adventures have caused him to be reduced from Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to argue on some places, but then, it will be very difficult to continue.
Two countries have no ambassadors in each other's country since 1963.
The former president of Edwards Rodrigues Voltz, a member of the Bolivian Belvello, rejected the idea that court decision was inexplicable.
He said that Bolivia would have a wonderful opportunity to start a new period of relationship with Chile on Monday, and that it would be an opportunity to end the years of mutual interest.
Caldilla also made it known that Morals -- which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America -- to use the sea subject as a political leverage.
And he added, "Bolivi will never pass through his rights to access the Pacific."
This commandment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmion doesn't happen unless this country can trust America.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea says that until the country cannot trust Washington, it will never destroy its nuclear weapons.
Ray said that on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to pursue promises that have been made during the meeting of the heads of two countries in Singapore.
This statement refers to Mike Pompo, the Foreign Minister of State, who seems to be about to re-integrate a closed negotiations that had been done in Singapore over three months ago with Kim Jong, the North Korean Leader for nuclear diplomaticism.
Ray says that the further bans and protests of the United States to announce the end of the Korean War will cause North Korea to kneel down.
Washington acts very carefully until Pong Young has a serious move to disarm the weapon.
Kim and the President of the United States called for a second session.
But the fact that Pong Young is serious about the removal of nuclear weapons that are likely to be the only way to ensure the safety of this country.
Pompo is going to travel to Pong Young until next month to prepare the second meeting between Kim and Tromp.
Paris's fashion showed you the last big hat line on the East Street Road.
If you want to raise your hat collection or completely prevent the sunlight, you don't have to look very much.
Valentino and Tom Brown, who is a fashion designer, presented a very large set of hats for the SS19 series, who looked at design style in Paris's fashion week.
In the summer of summer, he filled Instgram's helmets, and the designers exposed their eye-eyed creativity to the show.
It was designed by Valentino to wear a bee on the head with a wide edge that covered the head of the model ladies.
The other things that were so big included in Hindus, the magic hat and even the Anas, but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a series of weird masks that only use in Halloween during Halloween.
Many of these colored masks were covered by lips, and most of them were reminded of Hannibal Schultz to design clothes.
One of the designs looked like a dive hat that was associated with the breathing tube and the swim glasses, and the other was watered like an ice cream.
And if you can get these weird hats to look at all of you, then you're lucky.
The light managers predict that these big hats can open their way to street stores near you.
"La Bemba" is a long-size hat found on the heels of La Bemba, with a 60-inch edge on the heads of people such as Reahana to Emily Rajakski.
The mental school label that was scattered around the social media sent out a huge creativeity of its location -- a beach bag of sensibility that is almost the size of a swim model that carries it.
It was the main design in the series "La Rayra SS19" in the Paris fashion of the week, with the edge of a white pile of leather.
Luke Armitage, a well-known fashion expert, said to the FAMIL: These big hats and beach bags are expected to be presented in the streets of the next summer -- because the designer has made such a huge impact, so the demand for large side effects cannot be ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for citizens worldwide
Scotland's independent schools have a higher level of education, and in 2018, it continued with excellent results in the test, which is only strengthened by individual success in sports, art, music, and other social matters.
The schools work with more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, which are represented by the Scotland independent School Council (SCIS) to offer the best services to their students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for global education and higher education, choice jobs and position as citizens of the world.
As a part of the education that can design and execute a custom education program, we see that modern languages are still as interested and interested in schools.
"If you speak to a human in a language that understands, your speech goes into his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, your words will enter his heart."
It's an important point that we can't rely on only English to make relationships and trust with other countries.
From the results of this year's test, we can see that foreign language lessons are at the top of the league table with the highest acceptance rate in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who study foreign languages have earned the highest degree A.
The data collected from 777 members of the SSCIS shows that 72 percent of the students who study Chinese have achieved a higher degree A, and 72 percent of those who have studied in German, have gained a high degree of 6% of those who have studied in French and 62 percent of those who study Spanish.
These statistics show that independent schools in Scotland think foreign languages as a vital skill for children and young people who will undoubtedly need it in the future.
The foreign language is now taken and taught as a lesson, as well as the STAM lesson (for example, technology, engineering, and math) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A poll done by the British employment and skill committee in 2014 showed that among the needs of employers for employment, 17 percent of the lack of language skills in the collection was 17 percent.
Therefore, the importance of language skills to prepare young people for future professions is greater and more important.
According to future professional opportunities that require language, you can see how necessary these skills are in the world.
Regardless of the profession that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future that a lifetime can use.
The ability to direct communication with foreigners automatically puts a multi-gamous person from the front opponents.
According to TGov's poll, over 400,000 adults in England and 2013, 75 percent of people are not able to speak in foreign language, and France is the only language that is two percent of which is 15 percent of people can speak this language.
It is therefore important for children today to invest in language education.
Knowledge of different languages, especially developing countries, increases the chances of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools teach different languages.
Some schools focus on modern classical languages, while others teach languages that will be more important to England by 2020, such as Chinese Mandrin or Japanese.
It doesn't matter which language your child is interested in, however, there are many languages to choose at school and the training staffs in this field are also available.
Scotland's independent schools are moving to provide a learning environment to prepare children and equipped them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
Today, in a global business environment, you cannot deny the vital importance of foreign languages in the future of the country, so you must learn it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "the international communication skills".
In independent schools, you will continue to have a choice, a variety and superiority to the children of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is head of Scotland's independent school council.
Letborne plays for the first time on Sunday at San Diego.
The wait for fans who want to see Leburn James for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakes team.
Luke Valton, Coach Lakeers, announced that James would play at the opening season on Saturday against Denver Nuortz at San Diego.
But it's not known how many minutes it's supposed to play.
On the official website of Tim Lakeers, Valton said, "This time will be more than one and less than 48 minutes.
Mike Trull, reporter of the Lakeers, says that James will probably play for a while.
After training earlier this week, James was asked to release his programs for the first six games of the season.
He said, "In his career, I don't need pre-requisite games to get ready.
During the Tromp campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Tromp will begin a series of campaigns tonight at Wleling, West Virginia.
This is the first meeting of five planned meetings next week, including stopping in the areas of Tennessee and Mississippi, which are politically in favor of Tromp.
With a vote on its choice to fill the empty seat of the Supreme Court, Tromp intends to get their support for future elections because the Republicans are in danger of losing Congress control in November's election.
When is the campaign held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you be watched online?
The Tromp campaign is scheduled in West Virginia for 7:00 tonight at ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the tromp campaign online in West Virginia through YouTube’s live broadcast.
The Trimp may refer to this week's Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh, who was put on the scene with claims of sexual abuse, and was delayed by the Senate's approval for a week until the FBI's investigation was carried out.
But the main goal of these campaigns is to help the Republicans and strengthen their election in November.
So, according to Roys, President Tromp's campaign reporter said that these five campaigns will be held next week with the goal of "to give the volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans want to protect and develop the majority that are in the Senate and the council.
One speaker from the Tromp campaign who didn't want his name to be revealed said to Rotters, "The Congress Control is so important in the President's business program that he will travel to any state that may be possible, because we're entering a crowded campaign season.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's campaign planned for Wesbanco Arna in Wailing can gather supporters from Ove and Pennsylvania and be covered by Petesburg media.
Saturday will be the second time last month when Tromp visits West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percent of the votes in 2014.
Tromp is trying to help the West Virginia candidate for the Senate, Mr. Patrick Morris, who is behind the polls.
According to Rotters, Simon Heather, a political expert at West Virginia, said, "This is not a good sign for Maurice, who was forced to come here to help him recover in polls."
The United States Team of America has its determination to fight and keep the hopes alive to enter Sunday.
After three season one, the four-man golf game can be what Rayder needs on Saturday afternoon.
Ang movement is a completely inventive concept, but players really believe it, and in similar ways, nothing has ever been more than that.
So they say where the movement is now?
Jordan Sieth, walking around all day, said, "They had six points and now it's four points, so I think we're doing it with a little bit of movement.
Europe, of course, is superior, is four points ahead, and there are 12 more games ahead.
However, the Americans feel like they're starting to move, and they've got a lot of things that can be encouraged, especially on the form of Sieth and Jussin Temas that have played together all day and each, by taking three points of four points.
Sieth's movements from T to Green have been excellent and a pattern for others.
As he continued his game's turn, the happy screams grew up, he was able to throw a vital foot into the hole and double the race at four points when he and Thomas were two points behind two.
His leg, who won the race for them in 15, joined them with the same scream, the kind of scream that he was telling you that he believed that the American team would not be removed.
She said, "You really have to work hard and worry about your race."
This is all that's left each of these players now.
18 holes to do extraordinary work.
The only players who have won more than Sieth and Thomas over the last two days are the "Fresco Molini" and "Tommy Fletwood", and the "Rayder Cup".
The strange but impressive couple of Europe has won four points of four possible points and offered perfect work.
"Mulved" was the only couple who didn't bang on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and even Friday morning at nine squares.
This is the way that their energy is traded with this happy, energy population, which clearly shows that they are players who can win on Sunday, and when the sun sets in Le Golf National, there's no other famous player except Fletwood and Molinari to guarantee the possible success of Europe.
Most preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, it's still too soon to talk about the Great of Europe.
==History==Bubba Watson and Webcommson finished working as fast as they were at the end of the morning.
A bug and two times in the first nine squares threw Sparard and Swede into a hole where they could never get out of it.
However, there's no one on Sunday to help you get out of your hole.
It's very interesting to watch four-man games and four balls from close-up interactions between players, giving counsel and not giving, and the way a strategy can change at a time.
So far, Europe has done better as a team, and with a significant advantage it goes into the end of the day, but this season has shown that the U.S. team has also had the courage and courage to fight, which some Americans particularly doubt.
Europe has the top of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe was able to go up to 10-6 of the United States and have a good privilege on the final day of the weekend after four balls appeared very well.
The amazing couple of Tomie Follwood and Franceco Molinari were able to win two winners against the Tigers who worked hard and inspire others and bring their score to four by now in Le Golf National.
Tomas Bjren of the European team who wanted to maintain the cup that they had lost two years ago at Hazeletin, in the morning's four ball games, was able to beat one of the American players who had a bad throw and win the score 3-1.
The U.S. team showed more resistance to the four races and won two games, but they couldn't make up for their fallbacks.
The Jim Foryk team needs eight points from 12 Sundays' 12 races to keep the Cup.
Fletwood is the first European rookie to take four points in each other, while he and Molinari doubleed "Mollywood" after one weekend, and in the history of the Second Cup, the second couple who get four points from their first four races.
After winning the Wuds and Patric Red in the Four Balls, they beat Bryson Dechambeau's new work with a more decisive result.
==History==Wauds, who had barely won two games on Saturday, often showed his skills and skills, but failed four balls and seven serials in 19 through his 29 races.
Jostin Ross took a break in the four balls in the morning and went back to his partner, Henrik Stanson, and they were able to win 139 over Deusson and Recoques Kopeka, which are in the first and third ranks of the world.
However, the Europeans did not take their way on a pleasant day and with a pleasant breeze in the south of Paris.
The great winners set a good example for Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They won the four balls of a hard win against Jon Rahm and Ian Pollter from Spain and later returned to Spain, and won the four-man races, even though they lost the first two holes, with 3394 over the Poulter and the Roy McClove.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that the team could make up four points to enter a single race, although the Foyk team needed only equal to maintaining the Cup.
However, after second in two days, they seem to have been overly difficult to deal with against the Sunday attack.
North Korea says there's no way to disarm the one-way weapon without confidence.
On Saturday, the Secretary of North Korea told the United Nations that the bans continue to spread to most of his country, and that under such circumstances they would not be willing to give up their nuclear weapons on the same side.
Ray Yong-ho told the annual public assembly of this organization that North Korea has been doing "insidable acts to show its goodwill, including stopping nuclear and rocket trials, to eliminate nuclear testing and commit to lack of weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "But we haven't received any proper response from the United States."
"No trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never take action in the first place or in the same way against our weapons."
Although RR re-resolves North Korea's re-integration in front of Washington's resistance against the approach "A" of nuclear disarmion, which will be rewarded by the North Korean Korea by running each step, he will repeat it again, but his statement is remarkable that Pong Young, unlike the past, does not completely deny the possibility of a nuclear disarmion.
R points to the joint statement committed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Tromp on the first official meeting held between the President of the United States and the North Korean Leader on June 12, in which Kim points to the attempt to secure North Korea's safety against the efforts of a nuclear weapon.
North Korea has been searching for the official end of the 53-50 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pong Young must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists requests to reduce international sanctions against North Korea.
RR said, "The U.S. insists on the approach to "the initialization of nuclear weapons" and by increasing the pressure of sanctions, it is intended to reach its goal using force and even opposed to "the end of the war".
Some ignorant people think that sanctions can get us on their knees, that's a bad dream.
But the thing is, the continued sanctions are increasing our lack of trust."
R didn't mention the second meeting program between Kim and Tromp, which the President of the United States had mentioned a few days ago in the United Nations this week.
Instead, he mentioned three meetings held between Kim and South Korea's leader in the last five months, saying, "If the other side was in the case of nuclear disarmion instead of the United States, South Korea would not have been caught with such a dead end."
However, Mr. R.'s speech was completely different from last year, he told the United Nations General Assembly last year after "The Evil President" Tromp called Kim "the Man of the Dragon", a suicide man, the goal of putting U.S. soil with North Korea missiles is inevitable.
In the United Nations this year, the Tromp who threatened to destroy North Korea as a total "rescuing" year, was so proud of Kim's courage to move to disarm the weapon, but he said that there should still be many things to be done, and the sanctions should remain until the nuclear weapons of North Korea.
He said on Wednesday he doesn't have any time frames for this job, and he insisted, "If it takes two years, three years, five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said that the UN Security Council should reward Pong Young for his steps.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompmo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council should continue heavily and inexplicably until we make sure that nuclear disarmion has been fully completed and confirmed."
Since 2006, the Security Council has been trying to block the financial ways of nuclear programs and Balstik Pongong's rockets in order to increase the sanction of North Korea's sanctions.
Pompeo met R. R. R., and later said that he would return to Pongong Young in the next month to prepare the background for the second meeting of the heads of two countries.
In the year before, Pompeo traveled three times to North Korea, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pong Young in July when he said that progress was made, but North Korea only accused him of "continuing wishes" after a few hours.
North Korea was committed to meeting Moon in the current month to destroy a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes out "soft-recise"
He told him that he meant that he meant "resolable" security guarantees that Trump was committed in Singapore and said he was going to go to normalize relationships with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest.
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University, in an attempt to fight the development of Macho culture in the study of the night between living people who are taking lots of lives, most of all academic students want to sleep more.
One of the university's students found that most of the world's best university students are unaware of the basic principles about how they care for themselves.
Charles Czesler, a sleeping professor at Harvard Medical School and an active specialist at Bregham and Weeman Hospital, designed this lesson and believed that this lesson in the United States is first in its own form.
After a speech about the lack of sleep, he decided to start a lesson.
And she said unto Tillgraph, At the end of the year, A girl came unto me, and said, Why now, and in my last year, was I told this?
He said, "No one has ever told me anything about the importance of sleep -- which made me wonder."
This study unit is the first time in the study program this year and explains to students how good sleep habits help performance and sports and also improve public health.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist professor at Harvard Medical School and the head of health care, said that the university decided to add this lesson to the program after he found out that students were seriously asleep during the week.
This lesson includes a set of interaction activities for an hour.
In one section, there's a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and information on the effect of the cysin, light and how sports works are under little sleep and the importance of the habit of sleeping.
In other parts, the company is told how sleep in long sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
And then a map of the university's proselytes with interaction Inkons encourages participants to think about their everyday habits.
Professor Czesler added: "We know that this lesson will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effect of smoking on health."
He said that the culture of honoring the Night of Life still exists and increased modern technology and increased pressure on students shows that sleep is growing a problem.
He said that having enough sleep and quality should be "the secret weapon" for dealing with stress, fatigue, and anxiety -- even preventing extra weight, because it's a lack of sleep that keeps the brain starving, which makes a person constant sense of hunger.
A 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology and had been in a professor's class during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to try to provide it throughout the university.
He expressed hope and said that the next step is to ask all students to complete education before joining the competition.
Professor Czesler suggested that students should set up a warning to determine their sleep time and their wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "water Light Light" caused by electronic devices and LED light systems that could remove your day-to-day rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
LVINGS 1 - 0. Rangers: Menga's flower failed the Gnards.
The Dallley Manga gave up the team's break-up team, causing the Ringers to fail in a match outside of the house in Lingston, with the result of 0-1.
The Ibrox team was looking for its first win after the win of 1-4 at St. Johnson, but the Gre Halt team put up the second game that worked as a coach to keep their team in pursuit of eight points in the footsteps of Ladrox Premisip, Tim Hetts.
Menga would have produced his flower seven minutes before the end of the first half of the first half, and the Rangers' companions with their little motive could never show as good a show as it was necessary to get the game to play.
As the Ringers fell into sixth grade, Levingston reached the third degree, and only because of the flowers behind the Haberenian head.
One of the Ringers players, Calum Sence, was injured by the throw of an object apparently thrown from the end of the stadium, and had to be treated for treatment of the head wound, and this could be a problem for them.
The team made eight changes, which led the past to the final half of the Batfref Cup.
On the other hand, Heth went to the field with 11 former players, who were able to score a score last week, and had to be happy that his ready team would beat their competitors every time.
The Roangers may own most of the ball, but Levingston made better use of the cannons he had.
They had only two minutes to get to the mud when Manga had sent the ball for his first deep pass on the Alan MacGregreor gate, but it lost a huge opportunity and sent the ball out with a long distance.
A free shot was hit by Kaghan Jacobs and arrived at Captain Craig Halkt, but his team's defender was able to send Alan Letigvew to the back of the gate with a long distance.
Ranners took control of the game, but in the case of their game in a third end, it seemed to be more than believed, there was hope.
Allredo Morererell certainly believed that in 15 minutes, when he met, he had to be called Penalty, but Judge Stephen Tamson did not pay attention to the Colombian player's requests and pointed out by hand that he would get away.
In the first half of the first half, he shot only two shots in the gate, but the former gate of Iberox, Liam Kleley, was in trouble with the head of Lasana Coulby and the slow hit of Ovii Ejaria.
Although the 34th-minute goal team may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it.
The Roangers were unable to handle the Jacobs programs again.
He did not react when he passed the ball to the South Reubenson, and he slowly took the ball to Manga, and he hit the final shot and opened the gate.
He replaced Coulbali and Rayan Kett, and this change showed his immediate impact when the attacker was about to bring the ball to Morere, but Colley came out with a beautiful move and prevented it from getting there.
However, Lingston went on to give exactly the same beautiful game that the audience liked, and "Litgew" and "Helket" were one after the other.
The Hult team could increase its advantage at the end of the day, but McGregor stood up well against Jaquebs before he hit the head ball that was sent from Corner.
In the final moments, the Ringers switch player, Glen Middeton, claimed that when he hit Jacobs, he had to be called Penty, but not once again.
Yearly: Geiger Counter's inventor
And now a page from our Sunday's Bookbook: September 30, 182, 122 years ago on this day and counting... the day that the next physicist was born, "Hans" George in Germany.
Gyger created a method of detecting and measuring erosion, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
By showing the Gieger counter in the film "Koronado Bells" 1950, by the artist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, scientists who didn't seem to be cowboys, the Gyger counter, who was already one of the main foundations of science, became one of the main principles of public culture:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "Giger counter", used to track minerals such as an orcium.
When you put this phone on your ear, you can actually hear the effect of atoms that are produced by the electrolytes of minerals."
Ivans: "Surely, it will be now."
Hans Geeger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see Baymar cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill Baymar cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the patient's cells as part of treatment.
It includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into the lab.
Then they can see the protein in many cancers "see" and then re-integrate.
The test vaccine showed a promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman was treated with this vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify Baymar cells, and found that her molecular cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
This includes extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them into the lab so that they can see the common protein in many cancers called HER2 and then re-integration these cells.
Professor Jay Brezoski of the United States National Institute of cancer in Bethesda Maryland said, "Our strategy shows that we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Barzofski explained that "HER2" would develop several types of cancer, including breast cancers, ovarians, lung and large intestines.
The same approach has been performed to remove immune cells from the patient's body and their "school" education for how to target cancer cells, in treatment of some kind of blood cancer.
In his presence at SNL, Knoy West took sides of the Tromp, wearing a SNL hat.
It didn't go well.
The President of the United States announced Donald Tromp and said that he would be chosen in 2020, in the studio, after he was released in his performance on the "Sturday Night Light" program.
After playing the third song of that night called "Ghost Town", where he wore a hat with the Myrika Gret motto, he said things irrelevant to the Democratics and stressed his support of the Tromp.
And he said, "There's been so many things that I'm talking to white people, and they say, "How do you love Tromp, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racistism, I should've gone before America a long time."
SNL began with humor with the art of Mat Dmon, where the Hollywood Star imitated the testimony of Brent Kavanaugh at the Senate Court's court of sexual assaults, which was brought up by Crestine Besley Frid.
However, the part was not released, but the "West" film was uploaded to social networks by Cres Rock.
It is not known if Rock was trying to mock West.
West also gathered to the audience who had a hard time behind the stage because of the hat she was wearing.
According to Washington Examner, he said, "They beat me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They beat me!
And then they said to me, "You're in the dark."
And West went on to say, "You want to see the dark space?" And then he said, "He had to wear me, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?"
Try love."
Veriety reported that his conversation made it at least twice from the audience, and it seemed like the SNL players were shaken up and someone there said to them, "The whole studio has become a deadly silence."
At the last moment, the American singer Ariana Gunde, who died his ex-boyfriend Mac Meller, who was a rap singer, died a few days ago.
By playing "I Lover" and his dress was like a bottle of perryer, West surprised many people.
West supported the head of the TPASA task force, Candres Turner, and he tweeted: "To one of the braveest people: Thank you for the resistance against MOB."
But the host of the conversation program, Karen Henter tweeted that "West shows what he really believes, and that's absolutely amazing."
"But I prefer not to support someone who I think is accepting and spreading the way I think it's bad for my community (by buying music or clothes or supporting his art).
He added: he's free.
So do we."
Before the show, this rap singer at Twitter announced that he changed his name and said, "Now he's the man who used to be known as Keny West."
He is not the first artist who has changed his name and has placed the foot of the Doddy, known as Puffy, P.D.
His partner, Sonoop Dogg, who is a rap singer, used to be Sonoop Lion, and, of course, the mythical musician, changed his name to a symbol and became an artist known as Pance.
The charge of attempted murder in Belfast's restaurant after the knife was stabbed.
After a man was shot at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday, a 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder.
The police said the incident was happening in Beliequemre.
The defendant is expected to appear in the District Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
Kate Hirington's show star was critical of the toxic male syndrome.
It is known for the role of Joan Snow, who is a skilled swordman in a violent, fantasy, and Middle Ages of the Throne of HBO.
But this 31-year-old actor has been critical for having Macho champions, and it is said to show such roles that young boys often feel that they should be violent and harsh to be respected.
In the conversation with Sunday Times, Kate said that "there was a problem," and she was asked how to deal with the toxic male problem in the Meto age.
Kate, who recently married the star of her role in the throne show, "Ross Lesley, who is 31 years old, admitted that she feels quite powerful about the problem.
He said, "Now, personally, I feel quite powerful.
"What have we taught men when they were growing up, in trouble that we're seeing?"
Kate believes that television, thanks to her very male character, may be somewhat responsible for the increase in toxic maleity.
He went on to say, "What is natural and what is taught?"
What is taught on TV and the streets that makes young boys feel like they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our day -- how do we change this?
Because it's obvious that there's been a mistake for young men."
He also announced in the interview that when the show ended in the next summer, he did not want to play in advance of the game or continue to play the show and said, "He's done with the battlefield and the horses."
Kate has been acting in the re-resolvement of Sam Shepard since November, who tells the story of a filmman and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought he was the best result of the show on the throne, meeting his wife, Rose.
He said, "I met my wife on this show, so this show gave me my family and my future life from here."
In this fantasy show, Rose plays the role of Ygarte, the mistress of Kate's character, "Jon Snow".
In June 2018, the couple married on the property fields of Lesley's family in Scotland.
HIV/Eids: China reported 14% increase in new identification
China has announced a 14% mutation in the number of citizens living in HIV and HIV.
Health authorities say that over 250,000 people in this country are ill.
It's about 40,000 new cases, only reported in the second three months of 2018.
In the majority of new cases, this disease was transmitted through sexual relations that showed change in the past.
In traditional, HIV has spread quickly in some parts of China due to an injection of infected blood.
The Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yuanan province, but the number of people who have been infected with HIV has been reduced and nearly zeroed.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and HIV has increased every year.
The transfer of HIV through sexual relations is a critical problem in the LGBT community of China.
The gayness in China in 1997 was removed from illegal state, but the discrimination against LGBT people is very common.
Research estimates that due to the conservative values of this country, 90–70 of the men who had sex with men are finally married to women.
Many cases of transmission are due to sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide public access to HIV as part of the efforts to deal with this problem.
Maxine Waters refused to have his employee's hand in revealing the data from the GOP senators.
On Saturday, the U.S. representative Maxine Waters rejected claims that one of his employees sent the personal information of the three senators of the United States on the website of Visai.
The U.S. democratic representative announced that these claims were presented by experts and the "right right-of-right website".
In the statement that he published in Twitter, Wats said, "A lie, a lie, and yet a lie of the same."
According to reports, the information was published including the address of the house and the number of senators in the Senate of Mr. Lindsey Goham from South California and Mike Lee and Orin Hell, both of the provinces.
The information that was sent online on Thursday was sent by an anonymous person at Campol Hill during one of the Senate meetings about sexual abuse claims against the Supreme Court's candidate.
It was revealed shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Heil reported that conservative sites, such as Geetway Pandit and Radite, reported that the IP address, which specified the source of these posts, were depending on the Waters' office and published the information of one of the Waters employees.
Waters continued: "This claim is absolutely false and absolutely false."
"My employee -- who has been compromised by identity, personal information, and security, as a result of these false claims -- has never been responsible for revealing this information.
This claim is absolutely false and absolutely false."
The Warters' statement quickly brought online criticisms, including the former White House Secretary of the White House.
"This lie was associated with anger," said Faischer.
"It shows that he doesn't have the proper spirit to attend Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be hard.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
But it must be quiet and quiet."
Flyscher seemed to compare Witers' reaction to the democratic criticism from Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very angry at Thursday's meeting.
Omar Navaerro, a Republican candidate who was planning to replace Waters in the middle-of-time election, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
He said, “If the truth is true, then what is the matter with you?”
In his statement, Waters said that his office has warned the legal authorities of these false claims.
He continued: "We'll make sure that the agents of this matter become known and legal responsibility for all the dangerous and dangerous actions they've done to one person or all my employees."
Johny EnngishStrikes Again - A.R.A.R.A.D.
It has recently been seen in every new film that has a connection to England, we see signs of Braggst, and it seems to be true of the new version of the action-Johnny Enngish film, which began in 2003 with John Enngish in 2011.
Will it be an opportunity to make a comedy film about how low we really are?
However, Johnny Enngish's big eye, tireless face, and was able to produce a new version for the second time -- whose name is more likely to determine that he is a comic character designed for non-language non-language non-languages.
Of course, he's an idiot secret agent, who combined some of Detective Clouseau's character with some of the characters and some of that man's character and inside the film of fire chariots at the 2012 Olympic Olympics of London.
He was also based on the International International Man of Atkinson, who was once released in the commercials of Barcadard that had already been forgotten and left after the chaos.
In the last version of JE, there is only one or two beautiful scenes.
I liked the scene where Joni Enngish gets close to the helicopter with the middle-aged armor, and its feathers barely hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift is for physical comedy on stage, but it feels like it's weak and incredibly weak, especially since the film's film is now " really" and their own impossible mission is sure to offer comedy as part of the film.
It's felt that this film's humor was more intended for children than adults and to me, the humoral events of John Enkinson, are less focused on his works in his film "Bean", initiative, and focus.
This time, the theory of the film is that Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker hacked into the top secret network of British spies and revealed the identity of all British spies in fear of a working spy -- a sad little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last shot for a prime minister, an important face and pressured, and it's already completely lost because of political dissatisfiedness: "Emma Thompson offers his best performance in this role as Tresa-May, but there is nothing more in the letter film that can be used.
His intelligence advisers inform him that since all active spies are in danger, he must reuse one of the retireds.
And that means that Johny Enngish is now working as a teacher at a modern educational institution, and he's offering classified lessons about how to be a secret agent: there's some nice work here, and in the scenes where Enngish is studying at the Science Academy.
English will soon be returned to WHHHAL, and will be present at a brief announcement meeting, then join his former partner Bree, who had a lot of problems, which will be re-played by Ben Miller.
Bew is now married and has been transferred to a sub captain, the role of the high-class woman who was played by Viki Peperdin but has failed to play well.
So Batman and Robin, who made everything terrible mistakes, returned to the scene, and was placed next to Olga Kurlinko, who played the role of a beautiful woman, Ophilia Balltova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously influenced by the technology that has a professional character, claiming that he can solve British computer problems: the negative role of Jason Volta played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bede-Dees start their humor: they lead to a fancy French restaurant as a pre-time service; they cause a lot of chaos by sneaking themselves into a luxury boat and exiting the country; and English tries to use virtual reality to get to know the inner space of Vta's house.
All efforts are certainly done for the last scene, but even though it's nice and active, there are also effects of children's special films all over the film.
Something quite average.
And as with all the other movies, I haven't been able to find answers to my question: Can't the British film industry give Ron Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The working party rejected that he was planning a plan based on which the English work four days a week but paid five days a week.
Jremy Corbyn's working party is planning a radical plan that will cause the English to work four days a week -- but get five days of pay.
According to reports, the party wants the head of companies to give employees an extra day off with their rights by using the investments created by the AI Revolution.
This plan will cause employees to enjoy three days’ vacations during the weekend – and continue to receive the same wages.
Sources say that the idea with the economic program of the party is "small," and that the party is running to move the country to the benefit of the workers.
It has been confirmed four days by the Trade Union Congress as a way to benefit workers from changing economy.
One of the senior sources of the working party told Sunday Times: "It is expected to be re-checked before the end of the year.
"It will not happen one night, but the week plan has four working days, a request that corresponds to the approach of the party to create balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy for the party.
The party is not the first party to approve of such an idea, but the Green Party committed four working days in his 2017 campaign.
However, this request is now not generally confirmed by the working party.
One of the working parties said, "The week doesn't have four days of business policy, and the party doesn't have plans for it."
In the shade, John McDonnell used the working party conference last week to explain his opinion of a radical revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he decided to take back power in public service companies from the "unologist" and "user".
It also means that the shareholders of water companies can't take all their shares because the government of the working party can take them away from them based on the violations they've made.
He also confirmed that he was planning to bring workers into the company's board and create a group with property boxes to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sectors to employees, which means that they're going to get at the maximum of 5500 shares a year.
"Linsey Garham, John Kennedy, is told that the FBI's research on Kavanaugh has been able to change their mind."
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bert Kvanaugh has delayed his final vote for his engagement for the Supreme Court at least one week, and makes this question clear whether the findings of the Bureau can force any Republican senator to take back their support.
In an interview that was released on Sunday, the reporter John Kennedy and Lindsey Garham asked whether FBI findings could lead to change their mind.
He seemed more clear about his partner from South California.
He said, "I think, of course."
"As I said, I went to court, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened and this claim was released, and I said, "Did you do it?"
"He was determined, determined, and sure."
However, it seemed to be a changeable vote.
He said, "I've declared my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and such accusations can't change it."
And he said, "Well, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bretttt rejected it so badly."
"And whoever he calls, he can't confirm the matter.
She's 36 years old.
I see nothing new to change my mind."
What's the World Citizenial Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City is hosted by the World City Festival, which is a annual music event where a very famous group of stars perform and has a very important mission; ending global poverty.
The World City Festival, which is now in the seventh year, has brought tens of thousands of people to the Central Park to increase not only the performances of artists such as Jent Jamesson, Cardi B, and Shaven Munds, but their consciousness about the main purpose of this event to end severe poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is one of the developed parts of the global poverty project, which is an international support group that hopes that by increasing the number of active people in the face of poverty, they can destroy poverty.
People who want to participate in a concert, to get free tickets to this event (if they are willing to pay for the VIP ticket), they must contact poverty by doing a set of tasks or "sacrifices", such as voluntary work, e.g. e. e. to email one of the world leaders, or any other effective way to increase their knowledge of their purpose, to end their poverty.
But how successful has the world's citizenship been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, the right way to encourage them to call for action or some other kind of "Crickivis"? -- people who sign an online scroll or send a tweet feel they've done a great job.
A global citizen says that since 2011 he has registered 19 million "sacrifices" on behalf of his supporters who have worked hard to achieve various goals.
They say these actions have helped global leaders to move forward and to take out obligations and policies with more than 37 billion dollars to make a positive effect in life by 2030.25 billion people.
In the early 2018s, the group pointed to the 390 commitments of their actions that at least 10 billion dollars had been paid before or had been collected as aid.
The group estimates that the guaranteed website has had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments are the "The House of Notation", which is a group of investments and performers in the U.K., who have been committed to help children grow up and reach their full potential," and have promised to help with 35 million dollars in the United Kingdom to destroy the abuse of abuse in the region.
In April 2018, the ambassador of the New York City of New York said to the population: "With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens like you, we can eliminate the abuse of a social injustice and link history.
The group also said that after asking England for more than 5,000 actions to improve the needs of mothers and children, the government has announced that the cost for a project called the power of feeding will include the food intervention for five million women and children.
A global citizen answered one of the most common questions on his website, "What makes you think we can destroy the absolute poverty?"
He said, "This is going to be a long and hard path -- sometimes we're going to eat land and we won't succeed.
But like the civil rights movements and anti-Etytes that have been done before us, we're going to succeed because we're stronger together.
James Jackson, "The Wekkens", "Shwon Mands", "Cardi B", "Janel Moná" is one of the artists who will be hosted at this year's event in New York City by Debrera-Lee-Lee-Lee-Farens and Hogg Jackmans.
The United States can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports.
Washington reported that the President of the United States of Washington could be held in contact with his Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria -- especially that his activity is being applied to the legal government -- is an excuse to discover new energy markets.
According to the report, he said, "I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to deal with their own energy, just like they do in East and South Europe."
And according to this position, there are methods and tools to deal with.
He said, "The United States using its Navy has the ability to ensure that the seaways are open and that if necessary, it will block them to make sure that their energy doesn't go to the market."
Zinke spoke to the audience of an event that was hosted by Consumer Energance, which is a non-profit group called itself "the sound of energy consumers in the United States".
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and stated that they were practically similar.
While he mentioned Russia as a "one-life product" with fossil fuel economy, he said, "The economic option about Iran and Russia is less or less, the actions of influences and replace fuels."
These statements show that the Tramp policy is considered a cheaper option for European consumers to export natural liquid gas to Europe and replace it with European gas.
In order to achieve this, government officials, including the President of the United States, try to urge Donald Tromp to leave Germany, "The Unsatisfaction" Project, which, according to Tromp, are taking Berlin to Moscow.
Moscow has often stressed that the 11 billion-dollar line of Nord Starem II, designed to double the capacity of the existing pipe line and to deliver it to 110 billion square meters, is just an economic project.
The U.S. project is a major conflict with Washington for economic reasons, and is an example of an unresolved competition.
After a meeting with the Minister of Energy in Moscow in September, the Russian Minister Alksander Novak said, "I think we have a share in the matter that the energy should not be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose providers.
The position of the United States led to a severe German reaction and again stressed his commitment to the project.
The German industry's leader, the German industry, has advised the United States to avoid involvement in the European Union's energy policies and mutual agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting held between the President of Germany and the President of Russia, Dieter Kampoff said, "I can't process a third government to interfere with our energy supply."
Senator Elyzabeth Varren says " really" will compete for the presidential election in 2020.
The Senate Senator Elyzabeth Warren said on Saturday that " really" would take part in the competition for the middle of a presidential period.
In the city meeting, Warren confirmed that he was looking for competition.
According to The Hill, he said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and make our poor government, and it involves putting a woman in the top of things.
"After November 6, I will seriously look forward to the presidential competition."
In the mayor's meeting, Warren said against Donald Tromp, "He's taking this area wrong."
He said, "I'm very worried about what Donald Tromp is doing with our democracy."
Varren has been very clearly critical of Tromp and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said on Friday on Twitter, "Before we vote, we'll need FBI research."
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's chosen precincts were not interested in his vote in the 2020 election.
According to the political research center of the University of Sophulk/Beston Golobe, it was found that 58% of the "probably" polls said that the senator should not vote in the election.
Thirty-two percent of his company has supported the election.
This poll showed that people supported the former Governor Deval Pike, 38 percent agreed to his potential company and 48% against it.
Other prominent democratic faces, which are likely to be present in the 2020 election, include former Vice President Joden and Senator Brenty Sanders.
Ausciated Preses reported that Beyden said that by January he would make his decision officially.
At the Donald Tromp's campaign, Sarh Paulin mentioned his son's PTSD syndrome.
He spent a year in Iraq after he was 26 years old for military force in September.
he was arrested on Monday night for a domestic violence accident
His mother said at Donald Tromp's campaign in Tulsa Osloma, "What's happening to my son, after his return, I can name other families who feel the negative effects of the PTSD and some of the damage our soldiers have returned with.
Paulin spoke of his son's arrest as "a big problem that everyone ignores," and he said about his son and other soldiers' elders, "They go back in a different way, they go back with hard hearts, they ask if there's respect for what their friends and their Air Force and any other member of the army has given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, the police conference of the Vasilla Police Department, was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and, according to the report of domestic violence and having a gun in a drunken state, was accused of domestic violence against a woman.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of new policy against asylum seekers.
18 states alongside Colombia support the legal challenge for the new U.S. policy that prevents asylum from granting asylum victims from criminal groups or domestic violence.
The NBC News reported that 18 states and the Friday section of Washington gave brief advice to the court that challenges asylum policy.
The full name of the defendant has not yet been identified in the appeal of the Green v. Sestions, the United States Civil Freedom Union against federal policy in August.
He said that his fiancé, along with his friends' sons, had used him, but the U.S. authorities rejected his request for asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The government's attorney, who supported Grace explained that Elvador, Indovas and Goatala, where many asylum requests are sent to the United States, are countries that have a huge impact on crime groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy about asylum caused asylum re-resolves, allowing illegal immigrants who fled home violence to apply for asylum.
"Karl Recine, the attorney of the National Department of Colombia, announced on Friday a statement that the new policy ignoreds "The Tens of State, Federal and International Laws."
He said in his brief advice: "By the federal law, all asylum requests must be examined according to accurate facts and requirements and such an exception violates this principle."
The lawyers also argued that due to the possibility that immigrants would become an entrepreneur, and they concluded that this policy that prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. economy would harm the economy.
In June, the Attorney General JoffSions ordered that the migrant judges do not give asylum to victims from home abuse and the violence of the gangs.
At June 11, he said about this policy: "The asylum is available for those who have left their country because of torture or fear because of race, religion, nationalism, or member in certain social groups or political views.
The asylum has never meant to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face everyday.
In spite of the number of casualties, hard work is going on to find survivors in Palu.
The conditions for survivors were extremely severe.
Rasa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, used to slap her fever boy's body in an abandoned evacuation center in the town, said, "I feel so bad."
"Every moment an ambulance brought bodies.
"The water is clean, it's unresolved."
It's seen that residents return to their ruined homes, among their goods that are drowned in water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been damaged and destroyed due to the earthquake of 7.5.
Some of the wounded, including Dave Harris, who had a broken shoulder and his back, was resting outside Paulo's military hospital, where patients were treated because they continued strong earthquakes.
When he spoke of a strong earthquake, which shaken the fifth floor room of the hotel where he, his wife, and his daughter were present, his eyes were filled with tears.
Haris said to Asscied Preses, "We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I threw into the ruins of the wall and added that his family was present for a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife crying and asking for help, but then her voice silenced.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
"I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accused China that he's being charged with the "provings of the Pergagada"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in one of the U.S. newspapers about the mutual benefits of the Chinese-Estate agreement, the United States ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to publish Progada.
The President of the United States, Donald Tromp, later on Wednesday after accusing China of an attempt to interfere with the Congress election on November 6, which China rejected, along with the money in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Lowa.
The charges on the fact that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election showed what the U.S. authorities told Rotters was the beginning of a new level of pressure over China by Washington.
While a commercial order for commercials is common for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a massive trade war that has led to importing each other's goods.
Chinese experts and American experts said that the warbacks of China were designed to strike exports in states such as Lowa, who supported the Republican Party of Tromp.
In China, the United States ambassador, who has long been governor of Lowa and one of the major exporters to China, said that Beijing has hit workers, farmers, and American business.
Brenstad wrote in an article published in the "Des Moines Register", "This is continuing to be a bully by printing a lot of commercials in our free press."
Branstad wrote: "The Chinese government has been using its popular freedom tradition and free press in the United States by spreading money commercials in Des Moines Register."
He wrote: "In return, you see that there are limited opposite voices in the news store here on Beijing Street, and you don't see any real reflections of the opposite ideas that people might have about the economic ways of China worrying about China, because the media is under intense control of the Communist Party of China."
He added, "One of the most prominent newspapers in China has refused to accept his statement, but he didn't say which newspaper he meant.
A major analysis warns that the Republicans with Kavanaugh's scandal are fleeing women's polls from the middle-of-time election.
A major analysis has warned that since many Republicans have faced several sexual claims, they defend the Supreme Court's candidate Brent Kavanaugh and insist on his choice, this will result in a mutual reaction to women's future election.
The feelings around this issue are very much, and most Republicans have shown by the record that they want to make progress with the vote.
The professor of political science at the University of Maxville at the University of Srycuse, in the article published Saturday, said to the Hall, "These things can't be turned back."
Reaher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flick's 90 minutes support was enough of the FBI's research to comfort angry voters.
According to the Washington newspaper, D.C., Mrs. C. C. Mrs. Karene-Pierre, a senior advisor and the national speaker of the Move Owen on Friday said, " Women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget tomorrow or November."
Mike reported that despite Dr. Crestin Bessley Fried's testimony, the Republicans have the control of the court committee chosen to handle the candidate's engagement, protesting in the Senate on Friday morning and screaming, "Nomber is on the way."
Sotu Rottenberg, a neutral analyst, told the news site, "The democratic motivation is increasing."
"People say it's been a long time ago; it's true.
But it can go further, especially among women who have doubts and young people who don't often vote, even though they don't like the president."
Even before Mrs. Fried's public testimony, in which detail, he expressed his claims of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, a major analysis said that if the Republicans support him, there would be a mutual reaction.
According to the NBC News report, Mr. Michael Stille, former president of the Republic's National Committee, earlier last week, said, "This has become a complicated problem for GOP."
Goi C.C.I., who helps the Democratics win the election, said to the news channel, "It's not just a matter of the committee or the final vote or Kavanaugh, but the way the Republicans have been used to manage the issue and how they treat him.
However, the Americans seem to be more interested in believing in who the second words seem to be after the testimony done by Red and Kavanaugh.
The new poll done by YouGov shows 41 percent of the responders are sure to believe in Red's testimony, while 35 percent have said that they would either believe in Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent say that they think Kavanaugh is probably lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent believe in it.
The Goadian reported that after the FBI's support call, the FBI was investigating claims that were made by Red and at least one other defendant named Deborah Remirez.
Last week, Red swore to the Senate Court and testified that Kavanaugh had raped him at 17 years of age.
Remirez claims that the Supreme Court's candidate, while attending a party together in the 1980s, has shown him his body.
The Web Network inventor plans to run a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Breners-Lee is an inventor of the global network running a start-up that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the myth is the Invest company based on the open-key text platform, Sod.
Sod allows users to choose where to store their information and what information to access.
In his exclusive interview with Frank Copany, he was jokingly saying that the idea behind the Introt was "the World War".
He said, "We need to do it now."
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses the Sod technology to allow people to create the online space of their own personal data store or POD.
It can contain a list of audiences, job lists, calendars, music librarys and other professionals.
This is similar to that of the Gollle Dode service, Macroft Outlook, Solk and Sputify are all available at the same time and in a browser.
What this online storage space makes personal information unique is that it completely depends on who can access what kind of information.
This company is called "the ability of a person through information."
According to the CEO John Boss, the idea is that the company can provide resources, processing, and proper skills to help keep Sould available.
This company is currently made up of Breers-Lee, Brece, a security platform that has been bought by IBM, several developers that have been signed to work on the project and a set of volunteers.
Since this week, technology developers from around the world can create their non-intensive programs using available tools in the Introtop website.
Brenners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Fixbook and Google" about creating a complete change that makes all commercial models upside down one night.
"We don't ask them."
Breners-Lee in the post in the media published on Saturday, wrote that "The Invest Agents Invest provides commercial energy and an echo system to help protect a new profile and the quality of the web that is built on the Sold."
Brenners-Lee changed the Internet in 1994 when Kensium created the global web network at Massachusetts technology.
In recent months, Brenners-Lee has been a very effective face in the network's neutral argument.
Even by running Introtop, the founder and manager of the global network, the Web Foundation, and the Web Information Foundation will remain open.
Brenners-Lee added, "I'm very optimistic about the next time on the Web.
The priest of Victoria's cross was glorified in World War I.
From the only priest in the Church of England who was able to receive Victoria's cross as a warrior in World War I, it was praised for the anniversary of the prize at its home.
He was awarded the award on September 29, 1918, at the attack on Belglys and Lehakourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had received the highest military honor in England.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was displayed by its two grandchildren during a parade in Rashoden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that exactly 100 years after his grandfather's masterpiece, which led to this honor, was shown from his memorial rock, "The Show and Smart".
According to Lendon Gzatttt on September 29, 1918, the second Colonel Vann led his leader in Canal de Sint-Quntininin, under a thick fog, under a heavy ball and gun fire.
He later attacked the line of fire and led the line forward with the "all," before the ball attacked and destroyed three companies.
The second Colonel Vannon was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
A 72-year-old Michael Vannon said that his grandfather's actions were "what I know I could never be good enough but small."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the parade led by the Brentwood youth group, took the crown to his memorial on earth.
Michael Vannon said, "He feels very proud to play a role in the parade," and he added, "A true hero is shown by the support done by many people."
The MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the bellator, but instead they got their hands on Peppa Peg.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a bellator just so you don't watch the main event.
San Jose's bill included 13 fights, including six fights in the main card, which were released live through channel 5 in England during the night.
At 6 a.m., when Ggard Mosssi and Ray MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the TV cover was cut off, and the work was played out and shocked by the English audience.
Some of them felt bad after they were up to watch the fight until early morning.
One of the fans on Twitter called changing children's activities "a sick joke".
When he was asked about this change in the program, he said, "This content is not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., so they had to change the program into children's work."
"Pippa Peg," yes.
The president of the Belator Company said that they were going to work on planning to cover England's audiences in the future.
And Koker said, "When I think about re-existing, I think we can think about that plan."
"But in this case, it was at 6:00 a.m. Sunday morning, and we can't think about it until Sunday at their time and Monday time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change was done, there was a lot of messages and these messages weren't friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this will not happen in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five fights -- like we usually do -- this time we've tried to give extra services to the fans and we just tried it.
It's a sad situation."

Tom Dayley's Olympic woman said that she grew up growing up because of her sexual desire for everyone; but she was motivated by it to succeed.
She said that until she went to high school, she didn't realize that they were all like me."
In the first show, he said, "Radio 4 Dost of the Island Days", which was performed by the Loreen Laverne show, he spoke plainly about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a father made him stop caring about winning the Olympic Games.
The main editor of this old program has taken a few months off due to the disease.
He said that he had a sense of humor towards everyone else because " socially, love of sons and girls" was unacceptable.
He said, "To this day, this feeling of humiliation has been real things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that he was important, so that when others were informed of his sexual desires, he wouldn't let them down.
He won the Olympic Nobel Prize twice became a popular LGBT campaign fighter, and used his presence in the games of the year to play together in Australia and asked more countries to legalize gays.
He said that he spoke plainly, that he felt lucky to be able to live clearly and without negative consequences and wanted to give others hope.
He became the champion of the world three times said that falling in love with a man -- American filmer Deust Lingback, who met him in 2013 -- "I'm surprised."
He married this Oscar winner 20 years older than himself but said that the age distance was never a problem.
"When you're doing so much progress at such a young age -- he went to Olympic for the first time at 14 years, and his father died from cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone with the same age as he's experienced on the top and the same.
The couple were adopted in June by a boy named Robert Ray Black-Doleley, and he said, "His general hearing has changed."
He said, "If you asked me last year, all I cared about was winning the gold medal."
"You know what, there's bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
He said his father didn't accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if he still had the 2012 Olympic tickets -- because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell him you weren't supposed to be there to be in the front row, Father."
He said, "When his breath stopped, I had his hand in my hand, and when he actually died and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible."
The next year, Deley won the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
He said, "I knew that this is what I've been dreaming of my whole life -- to stand in front of a crowd of people in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that."
It was also inspired by him for his first choice of song -- "Proud by Heather Samal", who was with him at the Olympic Games, and still has a lot of interest in it.

Mikeelson is sitting on the bench on Saturday.
The American Paul Michaelson has a new record on Sunday playing at the 47th Ryder Cup, but come on the form to prevent it from turning into a dissatisfaction point.
In the event, Mikeson, who attended the event for two years, was placed on the bench by Captain James Fryk for four ball games and four people on Saturday.
This great player, who has a five-time record of winning, instead of being at the center of the game, as often as he went to the United States for the game, spent his day working as Leder Watch and trying to improve his game in the field of winning, hoping that he can correct his problems.
This 48-year-old player was never part of the best round-up, not even at the height of his game, but for the hard competitions of Le Golf National, which are usually turned out to be a long golfer.
And if these competitions aren't enough to scare itself, Michaelson will face the exact champion of the Brentish Open Day, which will be put on a team to win the whole four races this week.
If Americans who, despite the beginning of 12 single races, have four points behind, have a good start, the Mayleson match can be very vital and determined.
Fryk expressed confidence to his players, but he couldn't say anything else.
Fryk said, "He fully understood the role he had yesterday, and he praised me, and he put his hand around me, and he said, ' Tomorrow he will be ready.'"
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's earned a lot of credit, and in the past and this week, these teams have learned a lot from him.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
It was more than that, but it went like this, and I think we should accept it.
He wants to be in the field like anyone else."
Mikeson's record on Sunday will break the highest number of attendances in the Rayder Cup.
This could be the end of a professional career at the Rayder Cup that can never be as good as his personal record.
It has 18 wins, 20 losss and seven so forth, but Faryk said that his presence is for a team called Hood.
He explained, "He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to hold hands, and he's a big guy who's on the team.
"I think younger players have enjoyed him with criticism, including this week when he saw it.
He also brings us many more things besides the game."
Captain Europe of Europe knows that their decisive advantage can soon be destroyed.
According to his experience, Captain Europe knows that walking to the final day at the Rayder Cup can easily become an unpleasant end.
The Danish golfer began his career in the 1997 World Games in Valderrama, where a team was five points ahead of Americans, but in the end, nearly 11414-114-11413 was able to win.
Bjren, after watching the three-five-18 slaves, on Friday and yesterday, which led to a six-ten advantage in Le Golf National, he said to them, "Remember that we were superior in Valerma, we were superior, and we lost, and we won in Valrema, but we lost a little bit."
So history showed me and all the people who were on that team that the game wasn't over.
Tomorrow you have to go to the field with all your power.
Go there and do the right thing.
The game is not over until the privileges are registered on the board.
We have a goal, and our goal is to win the Cup, and your focus should be on the same goal.
I've always said I've focused on 12 players who are on our team, but we're quite aware of the team that's up against us -- the greatest players in the world."
Bjorn, happy with the performance of his players in this violent golf competition, added: "I will never judge this quickly.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow is the unique functions that determine everything, and that's different than what we have to do.
When things go well, it's nice to be in the field with a team partner, but when you're alone in the field, your abilities are tested as a full-time golfer.
This is the message you have to transfer to players, present your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you leave your team partner and he has to go and try to do his best.
In contrast to Bjren, Captain Jim Fryk will be looking for his players to do better than the team's performance, except for Jordan Squiyth and Jostin Tomas, who were able to score three points of four points.
Fryk himself had experienced both these major changes of the last day, and he was part of the winner's team before Europe had succeeded in "the miracle in Madinah" and had him end the game as a loser."
He answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, prepared for his final day, saying, "I remember all the damn words of that day."
"We've got 12 important races tomorrow, but you'd like that quick start you've seen on the blackline, like you've seen in the Medinah.
When the force moves to one side, it makes a lot of pressure on those who are during the race.
We determine our combination on this basis and we beat their companions as we like, you know, tomorrow we're trying to perform miracles."
The task of trying to lead the fight to Tumas and confronting Paul Césey, Jossin Rosse, Jonem, Tommy Fotwood, and Ian Pollter, and other Europeans at the top half of the mix, in the upper race with Roy McCelloy.
BJonn said about his separate choices: "I put this group of people in this way because I think it's covering all the parts.
The new German warship has been delayed.
Local media reported that the latest German navy had to be completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War ships, but due to the damage in systems and expensive costs, it would not be at least until next year.
According to the report "Die Zie" from a military speaker, it was completed and completed and assigned to the original ship "Rheinland-Palz" from a series of new ships in Baden-Wultberg's class, until the first half of 2019s.
The ship had to join the Navy in 2014, but it has been difficult for the fate of the ambitious project after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Worttttmberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will be replaced by old Bremen class ships.
It is clear that these ships will be used by a powerful ball, a set of anti-air missiles and anti-ship missiles and several escape radar technologies, such as a decrease in radar, infringion, and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance period – possibly new ships may be used for at least two years from their own shores.
However, the constant delays mean that these modern ships -- which are said to allow Germany to increase its power in foreign waters -- will become old until he gets into the Navy.
Last year, when the German Navy officially refused to use the failure of the F125 and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship factory in evil, it made a lot of noise in the media.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the ship factory after delivering it.
There's a little bit of information about the cause of the return, but the German media has said that there are some severe problems with the hardware and hardware that would have used the ship if it was used for the war mission.
The software resolution is particularly important because the Baden-Worttttberg class ships will be used by a crew of 120 passengers, which is only half the human force of older ships in Bremen's class.
Also, it turns out that this ship is extremely heavyer than standard, which reduces its function and limits the power of the Navy to add future promotions.
It is believed to be twice as heavy as "Rheinland-Palz" than the same class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to hardware, the cost of the entire project — including the training of the crew — is also becoming a continuity.
It is said to have reached the number of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with which new ships deal with it, due to warnings about the decline of the German Navy, are given special importance.
This year, Hans-Patre Bartles, head of the German Defense Committee, confirmed that the Navy was really going to "resolveable ships."
The official said that the problem has increased over time, because the old ships have been removed from the mission, but the alternative ships have not been provided.
He was sorry that none of Bden-Wvittmberg's class ships were able to join the Navy.
National Traust examines the secret life of bats.
New research is being done in part of the Scotish Haglands, with the purpose of the use of bats from this area to hunt food.
The findings of this research are expected to reveal new evidence of the behavior of these special birds and to help guide their safety in the future.
This research was done by scientists at the National Institute for S.T.E.L.L.D., a short lip bat, and a dwarf bat, and a long ear bat and bat in the Invere gardens in Westerves.
Special registerers will be placed in key places around the area to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS employees and volunteers will also perform motion map-making using the hand detectors.
The technical analysis of all recorded cases will determine the sound frequency of bats and what any species does.
And then there will be a map and a report from their town to create a detailed image of their behavior on the scale of the region.
Rob Dewar, a natural security counselor for NTS, expressed hope and said that the results of this research would determine which urban areas are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of urban management, including the creation of grass and how to keep forests, best for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the population of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has become significant.
They are threatened by building and development that affects their nests and causes them to die.
The wind and light cubes can also be dangerous to them, as well as bug paper and some chemical compounds of construction and domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of the habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to prey.
They use a complex echoing technique to determine the exact location of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, who is responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 75,000 people from all over the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
They've got 10 trained experts who are regular, planning operations, looking at nests and sometimes run rescue operations.
The organization has even determined the land of Treference in Damfres and Golley, which is a place of eight species of Scottish bats, as its first and only protected zone of bats in Scotland.
The director of David Thompson says that this area is an ideal territory for them.
And he said, "Here at Tree, we have a very good area for bats."
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all the right cities.
But there's a lot about bats that's still unknown, so what we're doing here and elsewhere will help us figure out what else they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of checking out the importance of the bats before the construction operation in buildings because it may result in the destruction of a mother's nest to kill the maximum 400 female and young bats, which would probably cause the entire local population to be destroyed.
The bats are protected and the killing is illegal for them to bother and to destroy their nests.
Elisabite Ferrell, head of Scotland, urged people to help seriously.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don't know how their population lives."
Ronaldo rejects rape claims, and lawyers seriously follow the charges of German magazine.
Christian Ronaldo mentioned the rape claims against him as "The Constinuing News" and said, "They want to make themselves famous by using his name.
His lawyers are looking for a complaint from the German news magazine "Der Sipigrell", which published these claims.
It was accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Maigrea in one of the Las Vogas hotels in 2009.
On Friday, Dor Sipigrell reported: It was claimed that he then paid 35,000 dollars to keep her quiet about this incident.
Ronaldway, a 33-year-old who was talking to his followers in Lao Instam for hours after they reported these claims, strongly rejected these claims and called them a false story.
"No, no, no, no, no.
He who won the gold ball five times a day said to the camera, "What they said today was false news."
"They want to make themselves famous by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous by taking my name, but it's part of my job."
The player added with a smile: "I'm a happy person, and everything goes well."
According to Rotters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to complain about the claims that it was called "integrated report of unconfirmed information in the privacy field".
The Crestian Schwartz lawyer said that the player was looking for compensation for "the traumas of the soul according to the attractiveness of this violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations that's been done in the field of personal rights in the past years."
It is said to have occurred in June 2009 in Swifti at the Hotel and the Palms casino in Las Vogas.
The report states that according to the documents of the district court of Cuck, Ronaldo and Myorga returned to the player's room after meeting at the night club, and claims that Ronaldo had raped him from anal.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo was on his knees after this, and told him that he was a 99% good person and had a bad "one percent".
These documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that these two people had sexual relations, but they said it was with consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed outside the court because she felt "the fear of vengeance" and was concerned about the publicization.
The 34-year-old woman says that now, due to the continued trauma of the claim, she seeks to break the agreement.
At the time of this claim, Ronaldo was on the verge of separation from Manchester United and joining Real Madrid, and in the summer he joined the Italian team at 100 million euros this summer.
BGG: The loss of cars for England will be a "streept" for England.
The Minister of business in England said that if England lost its position as the world leader in the car, it would become their permanent regret.
He added: "It's a concern that the U.S. unit told the BBC that if the British leave the European Union without an agreement, the production will temporarily be suspended at the Brenaston factory near Dreby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Kirk.
The Japanese carmaker said that the effect of border delays can be costed without an agreement.
The Brenaston factory, which generates the Auris and Avenis Tota, has produced about 15000 cars last year, which have been exported to other European countries.
"My place is that if Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, we'll see a stop at our factory."
The rest of England's vehicles, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how trade outside the border.
For example, BMW says that a month after BMW, it will close its Minny production factory in Oxford.
The main concern for what the drivers are saying is that the risk of the supply chain if you leave without agreement.
Tota's production line is based on the principle "right in time", so every 37 minutes of the British and the European Union's providers reach the factory to build cars on order.
If England leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it may be a breach in the borders that the industry says can lead to delay and lack of parts.
Tota's company said it would be impossible for us to keep our existence in the Drebyshire factory over a day, and so the production will be stopped.
Mr. Kirk said that Mrs. Tresa May's plan was designed for future relations with the European Union, exactly to prevent these problems at the border.
He said to the 4th radio program, "We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement so that, as I say, will allow us to succeed not only now but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity."
"The thing that's not only from Tota, but also from other producers is that they say we have to be fully able to keep using this successful set of supplys."
Tota couldn't tell how long the production would be stopped, but he warned that in the length of this extra cost, the company's competition could reduce and eventually result in the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsuluvallis, who has worked for 24 years at Brenaston, said that the concern of members of the Union is increasing: "In my experience, when these jobs go away, they will never be restored.
A government speaker said, "We need to make an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The White House says the meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House announced on Sunday that by continuing to argue about the Supreme Court's candidate Bret Kavanaugh, a risky meeting with Donald Tromptin's vice president, he may be "at least a week later".
Rossenstein monitors the performance of the Special Council's special advisor Robert Moller, who is investigating Russian intervention in the election and communication between Russia and the help of Tromp and the possibility of preventing the president from performing justice.
Whether Trump fires the Vice Attorney General, and thus risk the independence of Molller, in recent months, it has been the form of rumors in Washington.
A while earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had the subject of recording his conversations with Tromp and the president's release through the 25th correction.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But last Monday, despite his resignation reports, he went to the White House.
Instead, a meeting with Tromp, which was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
He said, "He prefers not to fire Rosenstein," but the meeting went off to another time to prevent it from interrupting its interference with the Court of the Senate Court hearing, where Kavana and Dr. Christian Bilzi Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Tromp ordered the FBI to investigate another week's violent claims against Kavana, and thus caused further delay in court.
Sarah Sanders, vice president of the Tromp press, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting of Rosenstein, he replied, "No history has been determined for this matter, it can be this week, given the other issues that are going on in the Supreme Court, it may be delayed another week.
But let's see what happens, and I'd always like to give the press the latest news.
Some journalists don't agree with him: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the editor of the program, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information provided about these meetings was not due to the lack of interest in "the attention of the TV reporter," although he said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they're looking for media attention."
Then he offered to increase the direct contact of the Tromp and the press.
"The President organises more questions and more answers to previous presidents," and he added: "We've looked at those numbers."
The meeting will continue, but if the press has the opportunity to speak directly to the president.
We're trying to do this more often, and you've seen several meetings these past weeks, and when you can talk to the President of the United States, these meetings will take place for press meetings."
The Trimp answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open meetings or press conferences with the highest authorities.
Public press conferences are rarely happening.
The President in New York this week may have shown the reason, and he came to meet the public of reporters freely and in a strange way.
The Minister of Health will write a letter to EU employees at the Finnish National Health and Health Organization for Scotland about concerns the (Breggsty) concerns.
The Minister of Health in a letter to the European Union’s workers at the National Health and Health Organization of Scotland has expressed their appreciation for their country and has wished for them to remain in the post-abertic phase.
The British Parliament of Scotland wrote a letter saying that there were less than six months left than that of the European Union.
The Scotland government has been committed to paying for the final requirements for citizens of the European Union who work in weak public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Ferdin wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are about to leave, these negotiations are going to be decided to be taken in the fall.
But the British government is also increasing its preparation for the non-information scenario.
I know this must be a very sad time for you.
So I wanted to insist on how much I value each member now, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues across the European Union, even outside, bring with themselves valuable experiences and skills that will strengthen and improve health care and benefit from the health services that I serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abrarmby goes under emergency surgery after injury.
According to Mike, a member of Tennessee, Christine Abrarmby, the sponsor of the Tincy Stygers team, went under emergency surgery after injury from the head area on Saturday 31–27 a.m. against Vanderdlers.
Rod Reed, myrmerby Tensey State, told the reporters that damage took place just a few minutes before midnight.
Reed said, "He went down to the line, and fell down."
He was given more oxygen on the sideline before he placed aubrmby on the stretcher, and his transfer to do more treatments.
A official official from Tinsey State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Neville, Tssie said that the Abramby surgery at Vanderbi's medical center was over.
Harris added: "There are still no details about the type of damage and the amount of damage that is yet to be damaged, and Sebastian State is trying to figure out when this damage has been caused.
Abrarmby, a second-year athlete, is passing his first season with Tensi State after the transfer from Illinois.
He had five full words on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought the number of words in his season to 18.
Foreign buyers bear much extra stamp costs when buying property in the United Kingdom.
The foreign buyer of the property in the United Kingdom will face more financial costs and additional costs will be used to help homeless under the cover of new grid designs.
It will undo the success of the Corbin plan to attract young votes.
The increase in tax stamps will be applied for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Home Department predicts that this cost will increase to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless.
It is determined that foreigners will pay more tax on buying property in the United Kingdom – and they will receive a free-of-charge amount to help homeless, the news that Teresa will announce today.
This is an attempt to undo the success of Jerry Corbin to attract young voters with the promise of offering a cheaper dwelling and the goal of making people with higher income.
The increase of tax stamps is applied to persons and companies who do not pay taxes, and the amount of government’s return will help fight the sleeping card.
This additional allowance – which has been based on the cost of tax stamps, including the higher tax rate of two years ago on second homes and purchase homes and then rented to three percent.
The Home Department predicts that this move will be paid to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's new homes are bought by residents outside the United Kingdom, which increase prices and more difficult conditions for first homes.
Many parts of the country — especially in the capital — because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad, have become a ghost city.
This new policy began just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of the loss of tax stamps to help young people own the house.
He accused large construction companies to keep the price of property high by land property and to use it, and he asked Miss May to leave the cheaper homes to fix "the housing" in Britain.
Mr. Crebin offers a series of interesting suggestions for repairs of the dwelling, which includes the control of the rental dwelling and ending the evacuation without error.
He also wants to give city councils more authority to build new homes.
Miss May said, "I said last year that I would give the Prime Minister the priority to restore the dream of Britain -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means we solve the waste market.
The doors of the British country are always open to people who want to build a new life here.
However, it is not right to buy houses for people who don't live here or outside companies as easy as British residents.
To many people, the dream of becoming the owner of the house seems very unlikely, and the shame of sleeping is very bitter in reality."
Jack Ross: "My top flight is Scotland's management."
Jack Ross, Chief of Sanderland, says "his flight's finality" is going to be Scotland's leader in the future.
The 42-year-old Alkat enjoyed the restoration of the North-Evert Club, which is currently divided by three points from the top of the table at number three.
He moved back to the Supreme League this summer to the Light stadium after he moved the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country like a player."
Ross told the radio of the BBC sports, "I got B, that's all."
"But I've been raised with my father since I was a child watching Scotland, and that's what always attracts me.
However, this opportunity only comes to Adam when I'm successful in management of the club."
As directors of Sanderland, it includes Dick Eddovkat, David Moiss, Sam Aldress, Martin O'Ill, Roy Keen, Gus Pow, and Paul De Conio.
The former president of the Alva Attic Club says that he had no fear of such valid names that were looking for this big club, and he had already rejected Barsley and Ipsovich's suggestions.
"Now the standard of success for me is "Can I take this team back to the top league?"
He said, "Because of the construction and resources of this club, no doubt belongs to the Supreme League."
"It's not easy to get the team back to the top league, but if I can get the team back, I know myself."
After spending a course as an assistant in Dombarton and a 15-month training period of Hart, Ross has only been in management for three years.
He then returned them to the third class of the table by preventing Alva's fall and replaced St. Marin from the team on the verge of falling down as the winner.
And Ross says that now he feels more comfortable than when he was playing at the Clayd, Hartlepolis, Fallk, St. and Hamilton Academy.
From taking responsibility for the Alva team, he said, "It was probably a real spot."
I certainly believed it was my appropriate management, much more than playing.
It seems strange because I was good, I made a good life of it for myself and enjoyed the high moral social position.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot you need to do during the week.
I'm still going through stress and work pressure, but I feel like management's really good for me.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing this, it's the best feeling that I've ever felt through my adult life."

Research shows that the right time for a beer is 5.30 p.m. Saturday afternoon.
The summer heat wave has increased the sale of British struggling bars, but it's made a lot of pressure on chain restaurants.
The statistics show that the bar groups have seen increased 2.7 percent of the sales in July, but the sale of restaurants has reduced 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant who was responsible for the collection of statistics, said: "The sun continues and the long-term partnership of England at the World Cup, which means that July follows a similar pattern to June, when the pubs have increased 2.8 percent of the sales, expect restaurants to get hit harder.
A 1.8% sale of restaurants got worse in June.
The pubs that serve wine and often have a more powerful function than they did in most restaurants that witnessed the decline of sales.
The pubs that serve food also suffered from heat, but not too much restaurants.
People seem to go out just to drink.
Among the pubs and many times, the sale of drinks increased to 6.6 percent this month, and the sale of food was reduced to three percent.
Paul Newman, a well-being analyst and guest of RSM, said, "These results show the ongoing process we've seen since April's end.
When talking about selling outside the market, the weather and the effect of major sports and social events are the most important factors.
It's not surprising that restaurants are still struggling, but the four-and-a-eight percent sales will be much more painful each year due to the increase of the cost.
This summer, warm and long, it couldn't get worse for the food shops and the time will be to determine whether the cool weather we've experienced in August will give us a very long time for these jobs."
The increase in sale of the whole kitchens and restaurants, along with the early establishments, was 2.7 percent of the month of July, showing that the production of new products to the market was reduced by great commercial brands.
The U.S. government's tracking system collects, collects, analyzes, collects, and is a valid standard in this industry, often and restaurants in the United States.
Every five children have hidden accounts in social media that their parents don't know about.
Research shows that from five children of one child -- some of which are only 11 years old -- some have hidden accounts in social networks that their parents and teachers don't know about.
The study of the guidance from 2,000 students shows the growth of "instagram's fake environments".
This news will increase concerns about the release of sexual content in these accounts.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "symmm" account to show their parents.
One of five children — some even to 11 years old — make social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
In a study of 2,000 students during the guidance period, it revealed fast growth in "Insta's fake accounts" -- reference to an Insta's photo sharing site.
This news will increase concerns about the release of sexual content in these accounts.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a pure account to show the parents, while they had other hidden accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found out that a teenager wanted to " rape me."
In a research done by the United Kingdom's digital intelligence and the Mr. And Mrs. MHC conference of independent schools, it turns out that 40 percent of people have two-year-olds, and half of them have confessed that they have secret documents.
Mike Butchan, head of HMC, said: It's very sad that many young people are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find.
Aisyd Deville on the Scotland sports board will be "the sound of the athletes".
Aisyd Doyle was elected as a non-privileged member of the Scotland sports committee at the current public assembly of the current government annually.
He is the most prominent athlete in Scotland in the field of two and squares, and the board's director, Len-bit, took it as an opportunity for sports pioneers to take advantage of his extensive experience in the last decade at international level.
Bity said, "Ilid has a lot of respect throughout Scotland, the United States, and the global community of athletes, and we're sure that by bringing him to the board of athletes in Scotland, he's going to benefit greatly."
Doyle said, "I'm eager to play as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can have a share and guide Scotland's sports.
The American athlete, who won four Olympic gold medals in 1996 in two hundred meters and 400 meters in the Atlanta Olympic Olympics in 1996, and is now a permanent BBC expert, after a temporary text, lost his ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can determine whether I can recover and how much I'll recover.
It was a really difficult job, but I'm completely healed, and I've learned how to walk again, and I'm going to be doing a very sensitive exercise today!

Adverts with breast pumps compared to mothers with cows have caused two hands in online opinion.
A breast pump company has created two hands in online opinion by contrasting nursing mothers with cows whose milk is washed.
Elvie's consumer technology company published funny video video to inspire a part of the commercials to show freedom that new pumps are giving milkable mothers.
Four real mothers dance with music in a barn full of cattle, which is the poetry of the following text: "Yes, I'm giving milk myself, but you don't see anything." And "If you don't pay attention, these are not my breasts."
The singer goes, "Go, run, run, I'll give the kids milk, run, run, run, I'll take the female milk."
However, this commercial, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused conflict in virtual space.
The video received a number of responses from the audience, which many said was "The Fear" video was joking.
"The use of cows is very weak to promote this product.
A person like us wrote that they should also get pregnant and give birth to a baby so they can produce milk, except that their kids are being kidnapped after a few days of childbirth."
Elvie's breast pump is secretly located in the nurse/mother's bra (Elvie/Mae).
Another person has thought, "It's hard to understand for the mother and for the baby.
But why shouldn't we use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who keep their children?"
And someone else added, "What an inexplicable commercial."
Some supported the commercials, like a woman who claimed to be the song "The Joyful".
"I think it's a pure idea.
If I gave my baby milk again, I'd like to have one.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad was a little stupid, but I accepted it as it was.
Someone wrote this is a smart product.
Another person said, "This is an interesting ad, and his audience is mothers who pump their milk and feel like a cow."
It's not a commercial to praise or judge the Tensimite industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with hidden pumps in their breasts.
The concept behind this ad is based on insight that most women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, without wire or pipe and is hidden inside the chest and gives women freedom to move, to keep babies and even to go out during pumping.
Anna Balin, a colleague and psychologist at the Mother's Department, said that Elvie's pump is like a revolutional product that deserves to be introduced bold and debated.
With the contrast between women and milk cows, we wanted to put down the breast pumps and all its challenges between the particle and at the same time display the sense of freedom that these pumps will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been reported.
During the week that London fashion was held, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion stage while using this product for Martha Yakukovski fashion designer.
Hundreds of immigrant children were moved quietly to a tent camp across the Texas border.
Although illegal statistics have been relatively stable on the border, however, the number of children arrested, part of which is due to the violent policy and politics of the Tromp government, which has made it harder to find support for children.
In the past, most of their supporters were not legal immigrants, so they fear that they would be in danger of moving into the country to support their children.
When the federal authorities announced that possible supporters and adults of their families had to print, and that information was shared with the Immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, Matthew Albenis, a senior member of the Immigration and Customs Agency at Congress, testified that the Agency has arrested thousands of people who have been registered to support children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the people who were arrested had no priors.
Mr. Albens said, "There are about 80 percent of the people who have been supported or supported by family members in the country who have been illegal and many of them are foreigners.
So we're looking for them.
According to the shelter staff, in order to quickly process child welfare, authorities announced new rules based on which, instead of the previous standard, which made the court possible 60 days after the arrest, some of these children are required to be arrested within a month of custody.
Many people are present to defend themselves in order to get a legal status against an immigrant judge using a conference video.
Those who are not qualified for legal support are expelled quickly.
According to the shelter staff and reports from the system in recent months, the more children remain in prison, the more they are exposed to stress and anxiety, which can lead to violence or escape.
The fans said that anxiety in larger centers such as Trenillo, where signs of the problems of a child may be ignored due to the large size of the center.
They went on to move children into tents without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good-bye to friends, which many are fighting right now.
Syria ordered the U.S. occupational forces, France and Turkey to leave immediately.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the teacher’s Secretary of State of Syria said that despite the war in his 8th year old, he asked the Afsans to return to their homes.
The teacher, who also has the Prime Minister's post, said that foreign forces are illegal to fight terrorism on the soil of Syria, and will be treated properly."
He said to the assembly, "They must leave the country without a condition."
The teacher insisted that in Syria, "the war against terrorism has almost ended," a war where more than 300,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes.
He said, "We will continue this holy war until we have cleansed all the parts of Syria from terrorist groups and the presence of any foreign illegal force."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are primarily training and offering advice to the forces, and the Syrian Arab is against President Basar Assad.
France has over 1,000 earthly forces in a country.
In the case of refugees, the teacher said that the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for creating unsounded fear that would keep the refugees away from Syria.
He said, "We've asked international communities and human organizations to provide this return facility."
They turn a problem that's just a friendly human being into a political problem.
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be helped until there was an agreement between Assad and the opposition forces to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats say about recent agreement between Syria and Turkey that a barrier area was built in the main part of the rebel base in Adelbe, which created an opportunity for political negotiations.
Russia-Trek's agreement prevented large forces from attacking Syria into the area where three million people live.
However, the teacher insisted that the agreement had a fixed "decision" and that the military operation would target jihadans, including the Al-Kalsar's resistance fighters.
Stephen DeMistora, the U.N. representative of the United Nations, hopes that the first meeting will be formed by the government and members of the opposition party to write the Constitution for Syria after the war and prepare the way for the election.
The teacher explained the situation of the Syrian government's involvement in the committee and said that the group's work should be limited to "investigation of the Constitution" and warned about interventions.
Why does Tromp win the next round?
With this logic, Mr. Tromp will win the 2020 election, unless the liberal authorities hope to end his scandal before his presidential period is completed.
Which, no doubt, would be the most tragic end of the American President's history."

The chaos is the value of entertainment.
Surely like nothing else on TV, stories that come out of Washington against the world, whether immigrant families can be together again and determine the health of global economy.
It's just a matter where special privileges come from.
And yet, when you find out that you've been watching a group of experts talk about using deep backgrounds for fear of Bob Woodward, the 10000-dollar leather jacket of Paul Manafort (the kind of thick suit) and hidden concepts about the violent description of the Daniels of Mr. Tromp, the issue of being aware of a citizen.

When I met Mr. Phillips this week, the air outside was 80 degrees north of the coast, but he was watching MPNBC inside the house, while recording the CNNN program.
He couldn't have felt it, he couldn't have been able to get away from Bert Kaana, who had had to face the House's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, who was unknown.
Mr. Phillips said to me, "I remember when we did those ridiculous shows in the past, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money sources from abroad became the most difficult election competition in the middle-of-time period.
It is no wonder that the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the unity of Congress's allies, has led to the competition of two competitors on a chair, witnessed the fall of money.
It's recently re-resolved the Democratic Party in the Region of Pittsburgh -- who won in a special election in the last spring.
Lamb is competing with the other candidate, Kate Rottoffs the Republic, who has recently been nominated for the 12th-year-old Pennsylvania area, and has been deeply involved in the new 17th-year-old area.
The plans were then changed, which were divided in January as the Supreme Court of the Old Zones was declared against the Constitution and were unfairly in the interest of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th area led to a massive campaign competition between the DCC and the National Republic of Republics (NRCC).
The name Lamb fell into the language after a close and victory in a special election held in March for the 18 Congress district and many people witnessed it.
The chair was run by the Republican Party for a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in the area.
The political experts had a positive look at the democratics.
The United States of America stopped at that time to support China.
The diplomaticists pointed out that the Great Republic of Dominic and Ecuador have now accepted Beijing with a few distances from Washington.
Mr. Tromp met with President Juan Carlos Warla in June 2017, and had a hotel in Hamburg until the partners fired the Tromp management team.
In early this month, the State Department speaker Heather Noret announced a statement that the authorities of the State Department decided to call the American senior authorities from the Elvador diplomatic mission, the Democratic Republic of evil and evil Republic, due to "the recent decision not to support evil".
But the punishment was only applied to Elvadodor, which was paid for drug control, development, and financial support from Americans about $14 million.
The punishment for the proposal, which included a decline of financial aids and visa restrictions, affected the Central American country and the high unemployment rate and the number of killings.
With internal meetings going forward, North American authorities and Central America delayed a high-level conference with security and economic growth to attend a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step ahead of the effort to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by the middle of September, the high-level government officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, in order to effectively end any trial of El-Lavador.
The politicians said that Mike Pence, the vice president, was scheduled to attend this conference in the middle of October, which shows the government's importance for this meeting.
And the three American ambassadors returned to Elvalodor, and to Dominic's Republic without a word of serious warning from Washington.
Three U.S. positions, two of whom were diplomatic and agreed to remain anonymous about civil negotiations, said Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the details described by three U.S. officials.
Their description was confirmed by an external analyst near the government to remain anonymous.

The next inevitable event may be Robert Muller's report, special advisor, about the possible preventing of Tramp in law enforcement, where there are enough evidence in this case.
According to the report, Mr. Muller will focus his research on whether Mr. Tromp's campaign with Russia's campaign on the attack on our election.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Tromp, right when he's preparing himself for the voter, he's responding to Congress, and maybe he'll finally see a jury of his associates.
Of course, but if it has too much, and I don't mean that Mr. Tromp's fall is inevitable in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, we all have to make decisions that will work out how long this will last.
The German officers were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, but only the West had to resist him and support the Osloacians' check in Monicche.
We failed and lost the opportunity to stop the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history around the axis of these points turns around and goes into an insufferable parade of democracy or fasts.
Now Americans are facing a number of points like this.
What would we do if Mr. Tromp fired the vice-consident General Red Restenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's research?
Resinstein has been in trouble after the release of the news last year on his proposal to record the secret of the President's calls and to comment on the wrong character of the Tramp for the president.
Mr. Resinstein says that the Times report is not accurate.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigations from Bert Kaana are not entirely fair or fair -- or, despite the evidence of sexual assault and false testimony to the Supreme Court?
And most importantly, should we vote for the Congress that answers Mr. Tromp in the middle-of-time election?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will go to a long winter sleep.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovaki, who was transferred to Ashvits' custody by the Nazi regime that occupied my ambassador's home.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light up the Saturday candles on a table with a broken cross on him.

Graham Times, team Rangers, forward with Wayne's team.
On Thursday, Rangers are hosting the Wade Wayne gang, and they know that victory against the Austrias, after receiving the same result at the beginning of this month, in front of the Spanish Waral, will strengthen their position in the European League for the next step.
The injury of Graham Dors' knee area, the middle team's middle player, prevented him from being present in the new season to the result of 2-2, but he believes that Rangers can use this as a launch platform to achieve greater success.
"This 31-year-old player said, "It was a good privilege for us because Vivalal is a good team.
"We entered the game with belief that we could get something and come out with a score.
Maybe we could finally get that ball into the gate, but, in general, it was equal to a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we appeared better.
Thursday will be another big European night.
Fortunately, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got good results in their last game, but I'm sure with the crowd they support, we can push and get positive results.
Last year was a really hard year, despite what happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself are a good feeling here.
Players have good conditions and kids really enjoy; training is good.
Fortunately, we can move forward, leave the last season behind and succeed."

Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, some of them were talking about it with their families.
About half the people in this study said they were talking to their wives about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
Holly Schneeder, vice president of the Life insurance company, said, "People want to take care of a family member, but they don't step forward for conversation."
This is where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not specify your wishes at the right time, you cannot prepare your family for care.
Talk to the legal adviser and your family about where and how to look after them, for this election can be a significant factor in setting costs.
Ask your financial adviser for advice: Financial advice can help you find a solution to the costs.
Your financial choices for long-term care can include long-term insurance, or life insurance based on the value of the money to cover these costs or to your own property - for as long as you have money.
Take care of your legal documents: win in legal slaves.
You can arrange a health care attorney to appoint a reliable person for your medical care and make sure that experts will agree to your needs if you are unable to communicate.
Also bear in mind the use of a lawyer in financial matters.
You choose a sure person to make your financial decisions and make sure that the bills are paid if you are unable to make them.

The earthquake and Sonami in Indonesia.
According to the official authorities, at least 384 people died in an earthquake accident and Sonami, Indonesia, and were expected to increase the number of casualties.
Because of the connection lines, relief authorities were unable to get information from the Dogala area, a region in the north of Palo, the nearest area to the center of this earthquake was 7.5 beard.
In Palo, over 16000 residents were cleared.
Some key truths include Paul and Dongala on the island of Salavii:
Paulo is the capital of the central district of Saliasi, which is located on the west coast of the Sosia island, and has a population of about 379.
When the earthquake and Sonami happened, the city was celebrating her 40th birthday party.
Dogala is a region of over 300 miles (180 km) along the western coast line of Salausi Island.
The area is a smaller office area than one province, with a population of 2,200 tons in 2017.
It is the main economy in the center of Salausi, especially in the coastal part of Dogala.
The extraction of Nicole is also important in the area, but most of the mines in Moruvali are focused on the opposite part of the Saliasi.

Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York.
The Federal Attorney of New York is looking to punish the death penalty for Syphilo Sypo, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight tons -- a rare punishment that was not performed for federal crimes since 1945.
30-year-old Sypo used a rental truck from Home Depot to commit terror terrors on the West Side highway in Manhattan, and hit the passengers and the bikes in October.
According to the plea of the death penalty recorded in the south of New York City, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sypo has deliberately killed eight victims and "intently" has caused them serious physical damage.
According to the court records, they both have the possibility of death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury called Siopoo to 22 counts of punishment, including eight counts of murder charges by smuggling aid, usually used by the federal prosecutor to refer to organized crime and charges of violence and destruction of the motor vehicle.
The prosecutors said that the attack required "projection and design" and that in the description of what Sypoo did, his actions were "extinence, cruel, and cruel".
In the case of the crime, S.H.I.E.L.D., S.I.E.L.D., S.I.E.L.L.D. has stated that S.I.I.E.L.L.D.I.I.I.E.L.L.D.G.I.I.G.I.E.L.D.I.E.L.D. has caused injury, damage, damage, and death of family members of Diego and friends of Diego, Nicholas C.A.A.C.
Five of the victims were from Argentina's tours.
It's been a decade since the last death sentence in South New York.
The defendant, Paul Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in the New York federal case, it was for Josephus and Eltenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed by the electric chair on June 19th.
According to court cases, Sypo, a native of Uzbekistan, did not repent during the days and months after the attack.
The police announced that he told the detectives that he felt good about what he did.
According to the report, Siopo told the authorities that the assassination motive was created after watching the video on his cell phone.
The police also stated that he also requested to take his flag off to the hospital.
He has expressed an innocent statement about 22 punishments.
David Pat, one of the federal public defenders responsible for Yayopo, said that they were clearly disappointed by the D.A.'s decision.
Your leg said, "We think the decision to punish death rather than agree with the plea of the criminal to punish life without freedom will only make it longer for those who fought.
Siopo's defense team had already asked the prosecutor not to be punished for execution.
A member of the House's Watch Party of Parliament says that Naege Farge should be responsible for the Breggite negotiations.
Naegel Farge vowed that he would move a nation's army today in protesting to the Watch Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should fight close pressure between the British and the European Union, as a member of the Parliament of Teresa suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Boon, a member of the House of the Origins, told Remingham that while Mr. Farge was a secretary, the British had already left.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced with the compromise of her cabinet members is being considered by the well-being party of the United Kingdom in the European Union who have joined a separate protest against Braggsite in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to follow the plan of exiting without compromise between the Braggsite supporters, the remaining supporters of the European Union and the European Union.
The allies insisted that despite severe responses, he would try to make a deal with Brux -- and force the opposition forces between the British and the European Union and the trade party to choose between his proposal or the "Hrage".
Mr. Boone, leave in the community, which was held at Soli Hole, said that he wanted to stop the exit plan without compromise.
He suggested that Mr. Farge must have taken care of the co-operations given to the Brassel negotiations.
He said, "If he had the responsibility, we would have gone out by now."
"I'm going to stand up for Breggsit, but we need to stop the exit plan without an agreement."
As he expressed his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight in World Wars to be humiliated.
We want to set our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Boon rejected the fact that public opinion has changed since 2016, "This idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in Europe's ideals is completely false."
He said to the reporter, "I simply must say, Prime Minister, listen to the people's words.
The exit has no popular agreement with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our political activists, who are actually working on the streets and making our choice as regent, are not interested in this plan.
Please leave the plan without an agreement and start listening.
He added to Miss May in a stinging message: The Prime Ministers keep their place when they fulfill their promises.
He said that if politicians are going to break the decision made in Rechamino, 2016, they must be forced to "do the pressure".
He said, "Now this is about trust between us, people and political class."
They're going to betray the British exit from the European Union, but we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let you go."
He added in a message to the eager crowd: "I want you to form our political group, so that those who are on the verge of going out of the European Union will resist pressure.
"We will move the army of the people of this country, who will win us out of the European Union, and will never rest until we have an independent England, self-existing and proud."
At the same time, the supporters in the European Union have marched in the city before they hold a two-hour gathering in the city.
After the anti-existing party started working at the weekend, a few activists started the party's heads.
Lord Adonus, a member of the working party, ridiculed the conservatives at the beginning of the conference for security issues of a party program.
He added, "These are the people who tell us they can install IT systems, and they can provide all the technology necessary for Canada to have the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland."
This is completely ridiculous.
He said there was no such thing as a good British exit from the European Union.
Warren is going to think about his engagement for the president.
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says, after November's election, "He's thinking carefully about his engagement for the president."
Boston Global Reports, this democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future on Saturday, West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Tromp, is nominated for re-residential elections in November to compete against the Republican Party, who was the president of Massachusetts's campaign in 2016.
He was at the center of the theory of women who said he might be a rival in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holiuk was the 36th meeting with the voters, which has been held as a public meeting with the people since the presidential election.
One of the audience asked him if he wanted to be a candidate.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to D.C. to correct and rebuild our pure government, and it needs a woman who's in the top."

Russia's Grand Prize: After the team won Louis Hamilton over Sebastian Wettle, Louis became one more step closer to the world.
On Saturday, from the moment Waltery Bots took over Louis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team would play a lot in the race.
Botas had a good start from the first line, and nearly separated from Hamilton to defend his position in the first two rings, and allowed the V.T. to attack his team.
Wetl was the first person to get into Pete Stupup and let Hamilton get into the traffic of the last car, which would definitely happen.
The Mercedes entered Pete Stupup and appeared from the back, but Hamilton was very close to the side of the car after a few moves because the fugitive was separated from the middle of the road, and after a double move, he took the risk of going to the third place.
Max Westupin began at the back row, and on his 21st birthday, he became seventh at the end of his first round.
Then at most of the time, he was number one, and he didn't switch his tires because he wanted to get to the finish line and get ahead of Kimi Reyconen and turn fourth.
He eventually entered Pete Stup, but was unable to increase his speed within eight rounds of the remaining ones, and became the fourth.
It was a hard day because Waltery did a wonderful job this weekend and really did a really noble thing that allowed me to cross him.
Hamilton said that the team did an exceptional job that has two winners."
It was a really bad nonverbal connection.
On Saturday's Saturday President Donald Tromp ridiculed Senator Diane Finnstein for his insisting not to reveal the content of Christian Bessie Ford's letter to the charge of sexual assault on Bert Kavana, the Supreme Court's best candidate.
The president, who was talking about a campaign in West Virginia, didn't directly mention Ford's testimony on the Senate committee, but instead he said that what's going on in the Senate shows how dirty, dirty and lying people are.
The president said, "What could happen in the Senate and what's beautiful has happened in the past few days is that when you see anger, you see people who are nervous, dirty, and lying."
"They spread and disclose the news. Then they answer, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'"
"I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, have you revealed this news?
Remember his answer... did you expose the document? "Oh, oh, what do you say?"
"Oh, no.
I haven't revealed it."
Well, wait a minute.
He added with a similar tone to the senator saying, "Did we expose the news?... No, we didn't.
They sent a letter to Finnstein, which in July last year, Ford has filed charges against Kaana, and the contents of this letter have been revealed earlier in September -- but Finnstein has denied that it was revealed from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't reveal his problem. It's part of Hill's report to say that Finnstein's statement on the committee.
"He asked me to keep this secret, and I did as he asked."
But his denial for the president wasn't convincing, and he's critical about what happened on Saturday night's occasion: "I'll tell you what really happened, it's a really bad conversation."
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst nonverbal connection I've ever seen."
The President continued his defense of the Supreme Court's candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, and he said that the Democratics were using charges to benefit themselves.
"They are determined to take back power from any way possible.
"You see the post and the mean, they don't care who harms and who they refuse to control."
The top League: "Denney Strez 5-3 Buffs took the Places.
Patrick Doir played two flowers in the match with the Dundi team.
On Saturday, the team returned on Tuesday to the top of the team, and the team won five over three on Tuesday.
With Patrick Dor and Francis Bovilleer' attacks, Jatz was able to play with two flowers at the beginning of the game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan County played the game equal, but then Deveer did the goal for the Jattens.
Franko Butchard doubled the game for Donnie, but again Lucas Landald Nillsen brought two Kingdom Victors into the gate.
This was the third defeat of the Supreme League in the season for Adam Bag's men, who were able to beat Donnie on Friday night in Belfast 2 over 1.
This was the fourth season's meeting between the two teams, when Jatz won his three races with the team.
The first game was won by Doir in fourth minute at 3:35 with the Canal McFafle flower pass, and four minutes later, Bovilleer hit the second flower with David Rotford.
It was half-perhesive, and Sullivan returned the host's team to play again at 13:10, but Matt Marcorhart helped out at 15:16 to play the same flower.
When Doir struck his second flower at the end of the night, he became sure that Jatz had won the first half of the game.
The host's team in his land restored its alliance, and Butchard again played the game again with a powerful flower at 7:37 a.m.
He and Charles Cororran cooperated with Nielson to bring forward the second half of Dundi at the end of the second half of the day, and eventually was confirmed by his fifth flower in the middle of their victory.
Jatz, who has already lost four games of his five games, will hold his next match at home on Friday with Milton Kins.
The Air traffic director sacrificed his life to save hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian people named the head of air traffic control for the safety of the plane carrying hundreds of people.
After a major earthquake on Friday on Solusi Island and following it, more than 800 people died and many were lost.
So severe earthquakes continue to disrupt life in the region, and many people are trapped under the porch of Palo.
However, despite his colleagues fled to save their lives, Antonio Gwanwan, 21 years old, did not leave his post in the control tower that was shaking heavily at Motara S.A.I.E.L.I.I.E.L.I.I.E.L.I.E.L.E.
He stayed there to make sure that flight 621 Batic, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to stand up by.
And then when he sees the tower falling, he jumps out.
He died later at the hospital.
According to EBC News, Australia, Josephus Siriite, Indonesia's weather speaker said that this decision saved hundreds of lives.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balick Pops in California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the plane got to Paulo.
He added, "From hearing this news, our hearts have failed."
At the same time, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths reaches thousands and the country's natural management agency says that access to the cities of Dongla, Sigi and Botong is limited.
Sototoprono Noo, the agency's speaker, said, "We think the numbers of dead people are still increasing, because many bodies are still under the roof and there's no access to many of them."
The waves whose height reached six meters have turned Palo into a heap of soil and will be held on Sunday in the city.
Military and commercial planes also brought help and help.
Rasa Kosoma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News, "There's an ambulance full of dead bodies every minute."
The water's low.
"They steal the goods of small shops everywhere."
John golfand from the World Red Cross in Indonesia, told CN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to face there.
It's a sad event, but it could be much worse."
Jacko Weddo, President of Indonesia, arrived on Sunday to Paulo and said to the military forces of the country, "I want you all to work day and night to do the evacuation well.
Are you ready for this? CN reported.
Early this year, an earthquake occurred in Lambak Indonesia, which took over 550 lives.
The fall of the micronesian plane: The New Jersey Air Force company now says that after the plane crash in the lake a man has been missing.
The aircraft that crashed in a lake in the Pacific Ocean in micronesi after his previous statement that all 47 passengers and crew members were drowning, now says a man is missing.
The Newgate flight company said that one of the passengers died on Saturday afternoon.
It says that with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives, it's working to find this man.
The company has not answered the specific information of the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
After an emergency landing attempt to land from Chok Airport, the plane crashed into the water and local boats were helped to rescue passengers and crews.
The authorities said seven people were transferred to the hospital on Friday.
The company said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the crash and the precise order of events has not yet been specified.
The U.S. Air Force Company and the United States Navy have both claimed that the plane crashed into the lake because of the shortness of the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane was out of the band.
Bill Janes, the American passenger, said that the plane was very low during the landing.
Janes said, "It was very good."
Janes said he and others were able to drown on a plane and walk through water that would reach their backs and bring themselves to emergency exits.
She said that she was scared and screaming, and she took a small wound from the head.
The U.S. Navy also said that the sailors who were working near this plane to repair the dock were using a windboat to save people, and they brought people safely to the beach before the plane crashed about 30 feet (100 feet) into the water.
The information from the air safety network shows that in the last two decades, 114 people have died in the crash of Papaa-Ginne's aircraft, but it did not include New Jersey Air Force.
The analyst presented the time table where the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi died in 2014.
Paul Rolett, the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness to information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone reports to bring together the work of 29-year-old defendant, Quentin Tlesss, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Schultz on the night of the accident.
According to Clary Dover's report, Ruth said that he received location information from a few mobile phones showing that T.I.E. had been with him on the night of the death of Heminger, which opposed the defendant's prior claim.
When the information showed that his phone was with his friend Michelle Sanford when he claimed to be with his friend, the police went to Sanford for questioning.
Sanford stood on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked her if it was true that she was in Sanford's car that night, she said, "She's lying because my car was in Nashville."
The other conflict was that Tlesss said that he had met him about two weeks before he died.
The mobile phone reports showed that at the time it was only a week since they met them.
He said that he had removed the message, calls and contact information from his phone after he died.
Hill said, "Tliss took her away from her life."
The final hearing is to be held on Sunday.
The judge has stated that as he expected, the trial will be brought to the jury that day.
Hi, B: What's the conscious hip-hop?
A third band of hip-hop music wants to challenge the negative view of this kind of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bress, from Brasstwell, claims that hip-hops have strayed from its principle that it was political messages and social issues.
They want to return this style of music to their originals and re-equire the conscious hip-hop.
The artists of music groups such as the Arnaze and Camon have recently seen artists such as Akla and Loki have been re-resolating music in England.
Another black one again?
The nurse from New York has complained to a couple because they fired him after sending a message to him.
A New York nurse complains about a couple who fired her because of racist issues, because she received a wrong message from the mother of the family that she was complaining about being another black nurse.
These couples deny that they're racists, and they compare the complaint to blackmail.
When this nurse went to their home for the first day of his work in 2016, Linsi Polcoman, mother of two children, found out that the new nurse, Gissel Morris, is black and anxious.
Mrs. Pasco-Flaxman wrote to his wife, "No, no, I don't want another black again."
However, instead of sending this message to his wife, he sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
After she found out she was wrong, Mrs. Polco Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, and she said that their good-looking nurse who was an African-American did something bad while she reported that New York was waiting for Nurse Philipney.
The cost of one day's work was paid to Mrs. Morris and then sent her home online cab.
Now, Morris has complained to the couple to pay for the deportation, and he's applied for $350 a day for six months, and he was hired without a contract for a certain period of time at his workplace.
He said to the New York Post on Friday, "I want to show them, so they know they don't do things like this, and I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded with a bad tone of claim that they were racist, whereas they said that his expulsion was wise because they think he can't be trusted after being humiliated.
"My wife sent him a message, and didn't mean it.
He's not racist.
His husband, Joel Paulsco, told the New York Post news: "We're not racist."
"But will you deliver your child to someone who you have been rude to, even if you have done it wrong?
Your newly born child?
Come on."
Paulsco, like this complaint, said that his wife had two months off for her child's birth and was "in a difficult situation."
This bank manager added, "Do you want to look for someone like him?
"His choice is not good."
While this complaint is still going on, public opinion has quickly condemned this couple in social media and has been strongly critical of them because of their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that the P.C. publishers were concerned about the lack of contact with the talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the band girl, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who's supposed to read the book for the first time.
It's very interesting to know what we know today about the great success of Pisington."
He says that his father, before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write to the children, was a BBC camera player, was happy to accept his book, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "tretch and sweet" after his father died last year.
He described Asrington as "the most important member of our family" and added that his father was quite proud of his final success.
And he said, "My father was a man of peace, and he was not a pure man."
"But because of being so real to him, it's like you have a kid who gets something: you're proud of him, although you didn't actually do it.
I think that's how he saw the success of Pisington.
Although he created Pirington and was born of his imagination, he was always crediting the success of the work to him."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the fall of his daughter, he was moved to Louis Pastor Hospital at the time of two cities, but the doctor's efforts were useless to save him.
Mrs. Adnan - Lapprez said he kept calling to say that my daughter was really bad, and that she didn't think she'd make it."
"Then Nad called me to say he'll be gone in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tshi, I love you so much, baby."
I'll join you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart alive were starting to go off and get out of his system.
He was already dead and all of his organs were failing.
I just had to sit there and wait and all this would happen to me.
Because I was among other families and people, I couldn't complain, scream or cry.
I really had to keep my peace.
In the end, Mrs. Adrian-Laupuz, who was now on a plane with other passengers who forgot what had happened to her.
And he said, "No one knew.
"I had laid my head down, and I kept crying."
It's hard to explain this situation, but it was on the plane that felt compassion for me all over me.
That Nad needed my love and I had to understand him.
I knew how much Nad loved him.
The grieving women put cards on the bridge trying to prevent people's suicide.
Two women who have lost their loved ones for suicide try to prevent people from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and a lot of Adams' cards on the bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he got depressed and killed himself at 18 years old.
He said, "I don't want families to experience what I feel every day."
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Liney, said that her son had a future chef who had a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew her with her smile.
They always said his smile would light up every house.
However, he left his job before he died, because "his work was really dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was 11 at the time, was the first person to find his dead body.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried that this will affect her."
Mrs. Davis has made the cards, to tell people there's someone who can ask for help or talk to her, even if she's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk."
Mrs. Hemfress, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark who had been with her for 15 years.
He said, " Mark didn't say that he felt sad or depressed or something like that."
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed the change in his behavior.
Christmas Day was so depressed that when children opened their gifts, they didn't look at them or look at anything."
He said that Mark's death was a very heavy blow for them, but they had to go through this: "This was basically breaking up the family.
Her grief kills us.
But all of us must continue to live and fight hard."

Bret Kaana's future barrier with the FBI's investigation.
On Saturday, Mr. Flick said, "I thought, if we could really do what he wants -- research in limited time, with limited range -- maybe we could get a little together," and he added, "Let's split up," without going out, the committee would be "stresssed."
Why didn't Mr. Kaana and the Republican supporters ask the FBI to start the investigation?
It's because of time.
Until the election between November 6th, there are only five weeks left, if, as expected, the Republicans will act badly, their efforts to find the man who wants to be chosen for the Supreme Court will be extremely weak.
George W.W. Bush took the phone to call the senators and lobby them to support Mr. Kavani, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
The Senate is voted, and right now 51 seats are available to the Republicans and 49 seats in the hands of the Democratics.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Kaana can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Mike Pens, vice president, can vote for himself and declare him the Chief Court of the Supreme Court.
The North Korean Ferraris under Kim's rule.
A South Korean lawor has said that since Kim Jong was established seven years ago, the number of North Korean fugitives has been reduced to South Korea.
The Park Bing - S. S., quoted from the Ministry of South Korea, said, "We had refugee status last year, 1127, which compared to 2706 refugees in 2011."
Mr. Park said that the larger border control between North Korea and China and the higher wages of human trafficking were, including the most effective factors.
Pong Young has made no public statement.
Most refugees from North Korea are eventually given a country in South Korea.
He said that after the end of the two Korean War, over 3,000 from North Korea had crossed the border.
Most people run through the border of China, because China has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than civilian areas heavily protected between Korea.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants not refugees and often forced them back to their country.
The relationship between two North and South Koreans still in war has improved greatly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Piong Young and talked about the nuclear disarmion negotiations that had been stopped.
This happened after a date between Donald Tromp, the President of the United States and Kim Jong, in Singapore, after a general agreement to disarm Korea's nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, Ray Young-ho, the foreign minister of North Korea, made U.S. sanctions cause no progress in nuclear negotiations since then.
In his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ray said, "If we can't trust America, we can't be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances, we'll step forward and not disarm ourselves."
Nancy P.I., says that Bert Kavana is "Hesterian" and it's inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Nancy Paris, leader of the House of Parliament, candidate of the Supreme Court, named Bert Kasana, saying that she is not fit to serve the Supreme Court in a manner that is not appropriate.
In an interview at the Texas Tribon Festival in Austin, Texas, P.I.E.
"I couldn't say it on Thursday, I think if a woman would do so, they would call her "Hessterian."
Kaana emotionally rejected the charges of having sex with her when Christine Bessford and she were both young.
Kaana was at the beginning of her conversation, and when she was talking about her family and her high school years, she used to scream and hear her voice.
He has clearly condemned the democratics on the committee and has considered the charges against himself as "uninformed and organized" because the liberals have organized it because they are nervous about the failure of Hilary Klinton in the presidential election of 2016.
He said, "Caana's testimony proved that he couldn't serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was anti-discriminate.
He said, "I think Kaana showed that she's not qualified for this job, and by how she talks about clinton and democratics, she shows her lack of authority."
When he was asked if Kaana was elected, and if the Democratics had again the majority of Congress, he would try to declare crimes against him or not, his response was negative.
Then he said, "I'm saying this. If he doesn't tell the truth about Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit for the Supreme Court, nor the governor who's working there."
Kaana is currently judging at the Washington District Court of Justice.
He added that as a democratic, he was concerned with possible opposition votes from Kaana against the law of the medical care of Sienna, which was either saved or passed against Wade, because he was a conservative judge.
Kaana refused to answer questions at her own confirmation meetings, asking whether she would return some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
He said, "It's not the time for someone who's a hypocrite and a zealist to go to court and expect us to say, "What's interesting."
Women should manage their tears.
It's a bitter and appropriate criticism, months and years of anger, and he can't get rid of it without crying.
Mrs. Schtinem said to me 45 years later, "When we get nervous, we cry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She went on: "The woman who was in charge of a place helped me a lot, and she told me she cried when she got nervous, but she created a technique, so that when she was nervous and she was crying, she said to someone who talked to her, "I cry because of grief."
"I am angry."
And then he kept doing it.
And I thought it was a very good technique."
The tears are part of the feeling of anger because the tears are basically wrong.
One of my most obvious memories of my first job at the office where the employees were more dead, is that when I cried out because of a very long anger, the older lady took my neck -- the letter manager, who was a little bit afraid of him -- and led me to the stairs.
He said to me, "Never let them see you crying."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they're happy because they hurt you."
Patricia Schward, who was then a member of the U.S. Democratic Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was seen on a boat with a strange woman named Mankney Bissse and left off the election, Mrs. Schveder, who was deeply disappointed, found that he had no reason to be the president himself.
And 30 years later, he said to me, "It wasn't a decision I thought very well about."
"There were seven other candidates in the presidential competition, and my engagement was the last thing they wanted.
One man called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dolls."
Because it was too late to start the campaign, and he didn't have time to collect the budget, so he swore he wouldn't go to the competition until $2 million.
The fight was a failure.
He found out that some of his supporters who gave the men 1,000 dollars only paid him 250 dollars.
And he wondered, "Do they think I'll get a discount?"
When she started her speech and announced that she didn't start an official campaign, she was so impressed with feelings -- she appreciated the people who supported her, she was helpless from a system that made money difficult and couldn't afford the votes instead of the delegates, and she was angry because of the discrimination of those feelings.
Mrs. Sherveder remembers how the media responded to him, "We have a mind disorder."
"You thought Clinx was my sponsor."
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my gravestone?"
"She cried?"
How could the U.S. and China trade war be for Beijing's benefit?
The experts say that the rain was the beginning of the commercial war between the United States and China, and that while the end of this fight was still too much, the difference between these two countries could be in the favor of Beijing for a long time.
Early this year, Donald Tromp, President of the United States, gave the first warning by closing tax on Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and Alminium.
The commercial tensions between two countries this week peaked on 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros), on half of all the imports from China to the United States.
Beijing retaliates to each time, which from the last sample can be referred to as the state of five to ten percent of the US's 60 billion goods.
China has sworn to compete with the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be so fast with these winds.
The return of Washington from his decision means surrendering to his wishes, but for the President of China, Shi Jin Ping, it is very embarrassing to bow before the United States.
However, experts say, if Beijing can play with his cards correctly, the U.S. trade pressures can affect China for a long time by reducing dependence between two countries.
Abigail Grace, a research member who works at the American New Security Center, said, "The fact that political decision without thinking from Washington or Beijing can create conditions that could cause economic collapse in any country is far more dangerous than anything that the authorities have already acknowledged."
Syrian Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees.
Syria says that it is ready for refugees' voluntary return and asks other countries to help with the restoration of the war that has destroyed it for more than seven years.
When the teacher, Secretary of Syrian Foreign Minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, he said that his country's conditions were getting better.
He said, "Because of the advances in the war with terrorism, Syria's situation has become more stable and safer."
The government is trying to rebuild areas that terrorists have destroyed and restore normal lives to the country.
All conditions are available for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who have left because of terrorism and economic measures that had affected their daily life and their livelihood.
According to U.N. estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country by starting the war since 2011.
Six million other people still living in this country need human support.
The teacher said, "The Syrian Rage welcomes the aids to rebuild this corrupt country."
However, he insisted that he did not want parole aids or aids from countries that supported Syria's insurgents.

"I don't usually cry, but I couldn't stop crying today.
It's been a hard year.
Thank you so much for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad we got the Cup back.
After the victory in Europe, the excited Garcii said, "It's the year of the team, and I'm glad I could help."
He told his fellow friend John Ram the opportunity, who was able to defeat the American golf legend at a single game on Sunday 2 and 1.
The 23-year-old Ram said, "To defeat Tigerwoods, I feel so proud, I grew up watching this man play."
