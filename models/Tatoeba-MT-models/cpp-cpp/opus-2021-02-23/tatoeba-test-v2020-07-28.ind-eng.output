It's easy to get along with Tom.
Wanna go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.

Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.

I'll buy you this bag.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
This is our responsibility to help.

The time selection is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.

I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we could.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.

Could I be crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You should've told Tom not to do it.
My mom's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.

You see something?
What are you looking at?

I think he's a doctor.
It's a very rough drop, it's better off the left.
