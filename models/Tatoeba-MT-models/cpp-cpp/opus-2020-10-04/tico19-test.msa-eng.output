How long has this symptom continued?
And all chest pains need to be treated in this way especially at your age
and in the fever
And what you need to check is also your cholesterol blood pressure.
And are you having a fever now?
And are you in pain now?
And besides, do you have trouble breathing?
And can you tell me another symptom you're going through with this simptom?
And how high your fever is.
and I'm also coughing
And I'm having a little celema and cough.
And my chest is really sick today
And is this the right time for your allergic fever?
and he got hurt in the chest.
And I think I'm a little fever.
And I want you to picture that chest pain.
And they also have a little fever.
and with your diabetes history
And you know my chest feels like it's gonna break
And you know people coughing on me all the time
and you have a chest pain.
And you say there's a sense of pressing on your chest.
Anyone in the family who suffers from heart disease of heart attack of cholesterol high blood pressure
Any symptoms or other problems you notice with muscle pain?
Is there anyone else sick like you at home with the same simptom as you?
Are you having any other symptoms?
Are you going through any packs?
Do you still have a chest pain?
Because it's a flu season.
But we should not be ignored by the chest pain that comes from the heart cardium
But the more important problem now is this chest pain
But I have trouble breathing
But I know a lot of coughers on me
But we need to take care of every chest pain very seriously
But you're breathing well now, aren't you?
Because of this chest pain I just forgot
Do you feel like someone pressing your chest
Does it still feel like the breath's tight?
Are they complaining to have a similar symptom?
Are you dealing with any other chronic problem, such as high blood pressure, or something like that?
Do you have any chronic medical problems like diabetes?
Have you experienced any pangs of breath with that chest pain?
Are you facing high blood pressure?
Are you facing such a stress?
Do you know the symptoms he's going through?
Do you see the image?
Drink water with a lot today
But then I took the test for diabetes
But then he has a rather similar symptom to me
How high is your fever temperature?
What about your blood pressure?
If you continue to have a hot fever
If you have a fever with 100 or higher temperatures
if you feel symptoms or problems you need further checking
I had a fever last night.
I have a little fever, too.
I had a fever last night.
I'm having a pain that's pouring out here in the chest
I've had a bit of breathing trouble, too.
I'll send an image to you.
I'm having a little chest pain today
I'm just having a little headache and a little fever today.
In my opinion it's a flu.
In my opinion it's a light flu.
Does it feel like a heavy person sitting on your chest?
It all started with headaches and with fever at about the same time
pain in the middle of my chest
stress like chest pain
It's on my chest.
It's in the middle of my chest.
it's in the middle of the chest
I feel pain in my chest
I'm so worried about this chest pain
I want you to tell me by describing this chest pain
Like high blood pressure or diabetes
Like exactly in the middle of the chest
Now for the fever you can take Tachipirina's candy.
Now Mary's been how many days you've had that symptom.
Now you're saying you're having a chest pain.
Sometimes I have a chest pain
Okay. Are you having any other symptoms together that's just sick?
Or someone sitting on your chest?
about the same as fever and cough headaches and muscle pains
Right in the middle of my chest
Show me this image where you feel pain
'Cause you're having a fever.
So do you think some simptoms might be related to your pregnant condition?
So are your children experiencing some same simptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain.
The fever rises at night
The fever I've had since two days ago
The fever started rising last night.
This is the Porter doctor in the emergency room triage center.
Can you tell me a little more about your chest pain?
I feel pain at the front of my body in my chest.
I'm having a strong pain in my chest
when I'm sick in my chest
What pain do you feel in your chest?
When does this chest pain start?
Where do you feel pain in your chest?
NS
You feel like the distress of breath on your chest.
You know I have diabetes and others.
You said you had this chest pain.
Insidens cumulative coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that rise fast in the European Economy and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
Insidens cumulative cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show similar trends in the European Union country and the United Kingdom, even though it's at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemik is being obsutely infected in all countries.
Based on experiences from Italy, countries, hospitals and insecurity units have to improve their willingness to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 that will need health treatment, and especially careful treatments.
On December 31, 2019, pneumonia cluster was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center of Control and Prevention of the Chinese disease reported an agent that causes it is a coronavirus novel that is now called a coronavirus acid syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Until now proves that about 80% individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, cth. An infection of respiratory channel with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients are cured.
In about 14% case, COVID-19 developed into a worse disease that needs medical treatment in the hospital while the remaining 6% case has a critical disease that needs a lot of special treatment.
The death of a patient being treated at the hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we're assessing the trend in COVID-19 cumulative incidents in every European Economic Constitution (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom and compare the countries to the Hubei Region, China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the country of EU/EA and UK to in Italy during January 31th–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 suffered further geographicularularularity and COVID-19 pandemic pandemics around the world at this time followed this country's dynamic.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization Director (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the 5th issue of Mac Eurosurillance 2020, Spikery et al. reported about the COVID-19 case confirmed in Europe according to WHO's definition.
In EU/EA, the first three cases confirmed by France were reported on January 24, 2020 among those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China.
As far as 15 Mac 2020, the COVID-19 case has been detected in all 30 EEA and the United Kingdom, which are between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39.768 cases and 1,727 deaths have reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy only.
Getting cumulative number and cumulative incidents case COVID-19
At the European Prevention Center and Control of Disease (ECDC), the COVID-19 counts that are informed in every country of the world, are obtained from only the official sources such as the country's health Ministry, the state's national health authorities and WHO, now updated every 8:00 in the morning.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trend in EU/EA and UK, and compare the data with Italy.
As the active COVID case proxy, we've calculated the immutable incidents of the 19th COVID case, so by taking the original path into COVID-19, in every country EU/EA and UK, during the 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also spread the cumulative number of cases that were announced to each country on 15th, March 2020, 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of Italian cases for the 31th of January-15 March 2020.
Trent COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK
Trend in the cumulative incidents of 14 days COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA and UK generally follows the trend in the Hubei Territory (China).
For EU/EA and UK as a whole, COVID-19 cumulative incident began to rise about 21 February and then a significant increase in about 28 February 2020 (O.S.A.).
This is mostly motivated by a quick increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EA countries and UKs indicate the similar trend for COVID-19 cumulative incidents.
Raja 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EA country and UK instead of the Italian case for the 31 January-15 March 2020.
It emphasizes that, as far as 15 Mac 8:00 in the morning, 15 other EU/EA countries and UK has reported the number of cases equal to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our decision indicates that the number of COVID-19 cases that are being informed are increasing fast in EU/EEA and UK.
The COVID-19 cumulative incident Trends that noted suggest that the pandemic is contagious at the same speed in all nations.
Even though the countries are at different stages, the diversity in national public health respondents and a possible differing case definition in countries and different protocols to choose patients that must be tested for COVID-19 authentication, including suspiration test.
In early March 2020, the hospitals in the area were affected in Italy, describing the situation that saw 10% of the patients who were infected with COVID-19 needing and media sources reported that hospitals and the care units in this area have reached maximum capacity.
The data about COVID-19 case entry in the hospital and/or the current care unit is available at EU/EA level for 6% and 1% alone, each (data is not shown).
However, the data must be collected in a systematic way to support the current monitoring data that focuses on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
The research that was carried on in 2010-11 shows a great variation in the care and caregivings of the air bed in Europe, between 29.2 in Germany to 4,2 beds for every 100,000 residents in Portugal.
This means that the country has some or less resources than Italy (12,5 special care and nursing beds for each 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
The moderation scenario associated with health capacity saturation, with a budget for each EU/EA and UK countries of spreading COVID-19 cases entered to hospitals associated with > 90% risks beyond the fitness of treatment, provided in the full size of both the COVID-19 risks of C.E.
Since so far the case has formed a cluster in certain EU/EA and UK countries, and hospitals and special care units are usually controlling the area's focus population, information about cases and settings should be provided in the Tatanama for region units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show the COVID-19 pandemic is being fast-required in EU/EEA and UK.
The country, the hospitals and the units of neat treatment should be prepared for substantial infection scenarios of the gradual SARS-CoV-2 and increase in the number of patients who are infected by COVID-19 who need health treatments, especially health care, such as it's happening in an affected region in Italy.
As urged in recent ECDC's fast risk evaluation, quick approach, proactivate and overall approach is important to slow down SARS-CoV2ularularularularularularularularularularizations, with shortages, because the rate of acceleration in the number of cases may not give the quick increase in the number of decisions and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response according to not implement earlier.
Proper risk evaluation also lists public health care measures to reduce pandemic effects.
There's a short window of opportunity watching countries have the possibility of continuing their control efforts to slow down theularization of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, other EEA health - health systems are likely to face increase in patients that need precise treatment in the next day or week.
The cause of the Koronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to the terrible acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so far has killed more 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in disaster for humans.
Just like the homologic virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of humans in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also spread out of bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanism.
Still, COVID-19 has a lower death number than SARS but it's easier to infection and affect more parents than teenagers and more men than women.
In response to the number of fast - growing issues of the new disease, this article tries to give an accurate view at a time and full of time on the rapid research subject.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, ethology, viral, diagnostics, treatments, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review will help us to understand and to eradicate the life - threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unexpected memory and won't be forgotten by the Chinese people who are urged to sit in the house for the holidays and weeks after that a virus novel disease.
The virus was very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a bad syndrome of acid respiratory syndrome in 2003; so it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization 11 February 2020 and a related disease called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
This epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As long as 2 Mac 2020, the virus has caused over 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients allowed home and over 3,000 patients to die.
WHO warned that COVID-19 is "many public enemies number 1" and potentially become stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 2000 papers have been published about COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, ethologies, diagnoses and treatments since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determines the sequence of viruss that are separated from some patients.
These comments give rise to the progress of research in the field of a new and rapid subject.
When it's appropriate, we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease with CoV, Central Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, started in 2012).
We will also consider things that we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of the disease and other important questions.
Traditionally CoV is considered an unprotected pathogen to humans, usually being the cause of about 15% of the normal flues 4.
However, in this century, we had two times found CoV a high-pacted man, which was SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which led to their own plague in China in 2003 and Saudi in 2012, and it soon spread into many other countries with morbiditi and terrible deaths.
So the current COVID-19 is the third CoV plague in human history recorded.
As shown in Rajah 1.1, an unknown pneumonia cluster reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commissioner.
Seven days later CoV sequence has been issued.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case of Wuhan reported.
In the meantime, the epidemic is spread fast to cities, neighboring areas, and territories.
It was reported that on January 20, people had infections in health - care staff, suggesting that humans could have infections.
On January 23th, the city of Wuhan was ordered to fight with all the public transportation services stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, from 41 patients with verified cases, only 21 has a direct contact with the Wuhan food market that is considered the beginning of infections of unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared the disease as a global health emergency.
By this time, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries throughout the world (Kingh. 2).
The situation is developing rapidly, so the end scope and severity of the disease are not discernible.
On February 11, 2020, multi-centric studies of 8,866 patients including 4.021 COVID-19 that are confirmed to give a more recent illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXaqA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients all age, but most of them are 30-65 years old.
Nearly 42 (47,7%) of patients infected with over 50 years of age, ranging in age 20, and only 14 people were infected at the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grew in most clusters in Hubei and around.
COVID-19 takes the average 5 (2-9) days from starting to diagnostic.
The average time of plural is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the start to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) day.
Base reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and RO is declared is 2.23-4.822.82.82.
The number of people infected by exponent advances before Jan. 2020, matching the great move of before the Spring Festival in China.
The patient's death rate with verified case is 1.4% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the death rate for all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major factors for COVID-19 are the males, the age of many bad pneumonias.
CoV is a family subfamily for large and protected viruses containing a single RNA deria thread.
The virus can be divided into four species, cth., alpha, beta, gama, and delta, between all alphas andCoVs known.
Spike (S) the surface's glycoprotein is tied to the cellular recipe of angiotensic 2 enzyme (ACE2) and diptidyl physics 4 (DPP4) for each of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membrane brane brawls is happening.
Virus RNA genes are released into the sytoplasma; after the virus species, the RNA genom is accompanied by the surface glocoprotein and the valid protensusid forming vectorics containing virals, which are then merged with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 found a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity in 10 compatible samples taken from the site of the disease, the Huanan Sea Food market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 are genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the electron electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the most thin part of human respiratory channels.
ACE2 humans are found to be recipients for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
Still, S proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are weaker in ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which happens to be equal to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new simple protein encoded by orf3b and proteins recorded by orf8.
Orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the virus typhogene and have the IFN
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of the entire human ACE2 at 2,9
They found that the complex, which has open and closed confirmation, has been merged as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which give evidence for the denomination and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be the target of the therapy for drug filtering for restricting SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Original and middle host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov are from bats and are transferred to each human being through musangs and camels.
By comparison of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic comparison with another CoV, bats are considered as the original SARS-CoV-2 host because the new virus is 96% similar to two CoV like SARS of SARS from a bat-SL-CoVX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Still, the intermediate hosts that help the virus to cross the space obstacles to infect permanent human beings are unknown, and the transminition path is still not clear.
Ji, et al., suggests a snake as a virus bearer of bats to humans that involve a re-entering homologic combination in S protein.
According to research, researcher in Guangzhou, China, suggests that the tenggiling - mamalia is a length of ants used in traditional Chinese medicine - is a potential intercessor for SARS-CoV-2 by 99% of genetic homology in CoV found on ggiling and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% that spread throughout the two genomes is still a big difference; so, the final decision to explain the concrete evidence is being held (The King.3.33).
SRAS-CoV-2 phyziaphimia is still a lot not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 45 days below 20 °C and the humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar quality.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraungu and heat radiation at 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, 75% etanol exterminators that contain klorins, bloody acids, chlorofoms, and other fats, but not chlorhreksidina, can disable the virus effectively.
The whole human population has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and because it is considered easy to be attacked by a virus novel.
At this time, no detailed research has been reported on the immunology response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to this earlier study of another CoV, especially the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Reh 4).4).
Generally, after the virus invades hosts, the first virus is identified by the original immunity system so the host through the pattern identifier recipes (PRRs) includes a letin like a C type, a Toll reseptor like the Toll (TLR), a reseptor like NOD (NR), and a recipe like RI (RRR).
Despite different paths, the virus causes the expression of influencies, the maturity of dendritetic cells and synthesis of interferon types I (IFNs) that limit the spread of virus and accelerating the virus's infectivity of the virus.
Still, the SARS-CoV protein can help the virus avoid immun responses.
Soon after that, the immutable responses of the adjustment would also help with the virus.
Limfosit T includes T CD4+ and CD8+ cells to play an important role in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce special virus antibodies and T CD8+ cells continue to kill virus infected cells.
The T-help cell generates collaboration sytokins to help defense cells.
Still, CoV can prevent T cell functions by causing apotosis of T cells.
The sense of humor is also a complementary like C3a and C5a and antibodies as well as important in resistant virus infections.
For example, the antibodies that are excluded from the patients who have been cured are neutralizing MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive response of the immune system generates large radical numbers free in the body that can cause bad damage to lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenarios, failures of some organs, even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection based on early clusters, more likely to trace the gold people with arbitrary and pregnant women.
It's common for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immun functions are affected, they have a higher chance to be infected than others.
The average period of budget of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on research on the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, the study of 1.099 cases shows that the period of sedation is three days average and shifting from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as mentioned above, indicates that the period of plural is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is important for the health authorities to adapt the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period, and to prevent those who are infected but have no symptoms of spreading virus.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the cuarantin period be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main symptom and early of the COVID-19, which can be accompanied without symptoms or other simptoms such as dry coughs, packing breaths, pillowing, pain, headaches, rinorea, breast disease, cigars, loya and vomits.
Some patients have dispnea and/or hyposeemia a week after they begin with illness.
In a bad case, the patient's condition is rapidly increasing to acute respiratory syndrome, recjacking aptic, metabolic asidosis and coagulopati.
Patients who have fever and/or symptoms of breathing and acid fever, even though without laxity of pulmonary imagery, have to be targeted for the virus for the early diagnostics.
Demography research at the end of December 2019 shows that the percentage of symptoms is 98% for fever, 76% for dry coughs, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for maturation; 8% of patients need help.
Similar discoveries have been reported in two recent studys of family clusters and clusters resulting from the preaching of an acvatomatic individual.
By comparison, demographic studies in 2012 show that MERS-CoV patients also have fever (98%), dry coughs (47%), and dispnea (55%) as their main simptomes.
Still, 80% of them need to breathe, much more than COVID-19 and consistent with a higher mortality by the MERS than COVID-19.
The matrix (26%) and throat pains (21%) are also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), matrix properties (20-25%), and puzzle pains (13-25%) are the main simptom and respiratory help was needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
Until 14 February, the death rate of COVID-19 is 2% when the case verified up to 66.576 worldwide.
By way of comparison, the rate of death due to SARS until November 2002 is 10% of the 8,096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demography research in June 2012, the rate of death is 37% of 2.494 cases verified.
A earlier study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is 6.47 height with 95% of a conviction interval (CI) 5.7-7.23, while R0 of SARS-CoV is only circular between 2 and 4.
The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV about simptoms, death rates and RO diseases are shown in Table1.1.
The number above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has greater potential for contagion than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less of bringing death than the two diseases.
So it's a lot more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Starts with crusters are often applied to the same family or to the same assembly or vehicles as a midweek.
Patients often have a history of travelers or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with individuals who are infected or patients in recent two weeks before they get sick.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry a virus with no symptoms longer than two weeks and the heal patients who have been allowed to return from the hospital can bring another virus, which send a warning to increase the quarantine time.
Patients have the number of periferial white blood cells (consciously limfosit) normal or reduced at the early stage.
For example, the limfopenia with the count of white blood cells < 4×109/L includes the count of limfosit < 1×109/L, and the level of aminotransferase and viremia acida has been found in 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
Heart enzyme and muscles and mioglobin levels have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive proteins and eritrosit sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In the patient with a bad case, the D-dimer stage, the product of fibrin degradation in the blood, has increased, and the limfosit count has been decreastically degraded.
The abnormality in the breast radiation found in most COVID-19 patients and was shown by the cruise shadows or glass opacity of the ground in the lungs.
Patients usually have a typic pneumonia, acid lung injuries and acid syndrome hard to breathe (ARDS).
When the ARDS happens, uncontrolled ruins, liquid gatherings and fibrosis are quick to hit the gas exchange badly.
The pneumocation of the type-I and type-II reduces the suffocating stage and increases the surface tension, and reduces the lung capabilities to expand and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, bad breast radiation discoveries are usually paralleled with the worst level of the disease.
On February 1820, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the decimal decimalation, the formation of the hialin, and the formation of limfosit interstitial lymphoids and a multiblycept cells in the patient's lungs who died because of the disease, consistent with the virus infection patologies and ARDS and similar to the SARS and MERS patology.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through the negative polymerase serial reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnoses.
However, because of the high lymphatic level, which may have forwarded epidemic, clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnostics (that are no longer depending on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations have occurred with SARS diagnostics.
Thus, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestation, lab tests and radiation discoveries are important and impractivity to make effective diagnoses.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protol of the use of SHRLOCK based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-CoV-2 synthetic × 10-18 molec/L to 200 × 10-18 lp/18 lpl (10-100 copy of input in less than an hour without necessary equipment.
May the new technique be able to enhance the sensitivity and facility clearly if it is verified in the clinical sample.
Because of a lack of experience with CoV novel, doctors can usually provide support treatments to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or suggested before for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus diseases (Jadual2.2).
This therapy may include occasional and potential antiviral drugs, imunosupressions, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicines, and psychological support.
In addition, the plasma that a patient has received is recommended for her to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical corporation to wake up antibodi and vaccine for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is usually attacking lungs at the beginning and may also attack, at a lower stage, other organs producing ACE2, like gastrousus and waist systems.
Even so, displaced and breathing failure are a major threat to the patient and a major cause of death.
Thus, breathing support is important to heal symptoms and save lives and including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, invasive ventilation and mechanical invasive ventilation depending on the level of the disease.
Patients with bad simptoms of breathing need to be supported by extracorporum membraneogeneum (ECMO), composing cardioulmonarial relocation techniques used for kardium or respirator failure treatment.
Besides, electrotic balance, prevention and jangkitan treatment and sepsis shock, and vital organ function protection is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that the sytokin storms are the result of an excessive response to the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The sitokin storm is a shadow of systemic breakdown that is characterized by sitokin serial release including TF, IL-1 tape, IL-2, IL-6, IFN.
This sytokin started a cell to release a large radical number of frees that are the main source of the ARDS and various organ failures.
Disorientation is important in sytokin storm treatment, especially for severe patients.
Corticsteroids and tocilizumabs, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodi, have been used to care for sitokin storms.
Other imunity charge for sytokin storms includes the IFN-
Steroid, as an imunosupres, has been used extensively in caring for SARS to reduce ravacy damage.
Still, steroids on high two don't benefit from the terrible lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids on two high can cause severe side effects, especially osteonecrosis avascular, to track the prognosis strictly.
However, two low to simple corticsteroids for a short period of time have been recommended to be carefully used for critical COVID-19 patients.
While this article was written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, the use of intravena with the remdesivir, a nucleotida analog, has been found to be effective against an American patient infected by COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel drug that Gilead originally built for treatments of the disease caused by the Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Then, the remdesivir also shows the possibility of another single threading virus that includes the MERS and SARS virus.
In view of this observation, Gilead has given the mixture to China to run a pair of attempts against individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the result is very awaited.
Besides, baricitinb, interferon-
The properties, the loyas, the vomits, the damage and the other bad effects can happen after the therapy combined with the lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used to a patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibodies generate
Blood collected from a patient who has been diagnosed with an infectious illness to cope with the same illness or to protect individuals who are healthy from its infection have a long history.
True, cured patients usually have a relatively high stage of antibodi to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodi is imunoglobulin (Ig) produced by limfosit B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and to identify the unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralize them directly.
Thus, plasma has been collected from the blood of a bunch of patients who have healed from COVID-19 and has been injected to 10 patients who are in serious circumstances.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, accompanied by friction and reduced viral burdens and saturation in blood.
However, confirmation and explanations are needed to suggest that this method of using large scales before special therapy is yet built.
In addition, there are some harmful effects associated with plasma, and it requires careful consideration.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immun responses and cause sytokin release syndrome, which is potentially potentially risking life.
Antibodies in the blood are usually low, and the demand for plasma is large to care for critical patients.
It's hard to wake up and produce a special antibodies quickly to fight global epidemic.
Therefore, it's more important and practical to separate B cells than a patient who has recovered and recognizes the genetic code that encodes the antibodi or filters the antibodies that work on essential virus proteins.
This way, we can increase the antibodi cost.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in different formulas according to disease diagnostics based on TCM theory.
Most effective components remain unknown or ambiguous consider it difficult to extract and confirm such components or its optimum combination.
At this time, due to the shortage of special and effective therapy for COVID-19, the TCM has become one of the major alternatives for patients with light symptoms to light up to simple or for those who have recovered from a severe stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsule were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
The highest cure rate in COVID-19 patients have been seen in several areas in China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hubei region (50%), which uses TCM in just about 30% of patients COVID-19, has a lowest cure rate (13%).
This is, of course, a somewhat harsh comparison. Many other factors, such as numbers and the severity of a patient’s mind, need to make that estimate.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his workmate published research to compare western medicines (WM) with the combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time it takes for the body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms and treatments in the later hospital is shorter in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic state becomes worse (between light to bad) is less than the WM+TCM group only (7.4% than 46.2%) and the death rate is lower in the WM+TCM group than WM only (8.8%).
Still, the detection and security of TCM are still waiting for a more controlled attempt at a larger level and more centers.
It would be interesting to describe the action mechanism and explain the effective components in TCM treatment or the combination of the treatment if possible.
A patient suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 most of them have a strong fear of very easily infected disease and could cause death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredity, loneliness and anger.
In addition to infections, such as fever, hypocsia, and coughing, such as insomnia that are caused by corticsteroids can lead to anxiety and higher mental distress.
At the early phase of the SARS plague, various psychiattric morbidits include constant depression, anxiety, panic attacks, panic attacks, psychotic symptoms, deliriums, and suicides are also reported.
Pronunciation of mandatory contact and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people feel more worried and guilty about infection effects, quarantine and stigma in their family and friends.
So mental health treatment needs to be given to COVID-19, individuals suspected and people who contact with them and the public society that needs it.
Psychological support must include the curing of multiple disciplined mental health teams, clear communications that are now fixed and correct about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatments and professional electronic devices to avoid close contact with each other.
The powerful vaccine is important to disrupt the chain of transfer from the animal and human area infected with the vulnerable hosts and usually completes antivirus treatments in epidemic controls caused by the virus.
The effort has been done by evicting a S vector based on proteins to generate a long-term antibodier and effective and/or aviation that protects from SARS-CoV.
Vacsin that is directly weakening has been tested in animal models for SARS.
Still, this potential vaccine detection in older individuals and their dangerous challenges models and protection against zoonotic virus infections has to be determined before clinical research began.
It's probably because the SARS has ended 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, the spooric cases and the MERS clusters continue to take place in the Middle East and stretch to another region because of ongoing zoonotic sources in the endemic area.
The displacement strategy was built for MERS by using unactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nano particles, particles like viruss and subunits of recombination proteins and some of them have been tested in animal models.
A safe and effective vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 for individuals who are not immumically required immediately and important to control the current epidemic.
However, it is difficult to cope with difficulties because it takes a long period of 18 months for the construction of vaccine and dynamic variations of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just indicated a full clinical path in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually heal without being infected again.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with morbidity rates and high deaths in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is vital for health care agency to put their services first, especially in areas where resourceless.
Based on a clinical study that has been reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with COVID-19 patients prognosis (Jadual3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 usually happens at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients are over 50 years old in research on 8,866 cases specified above.
Patients who need neat treatment are more likely to have a hidden irbidity and complications and a lot older than those who don't need it (at median 66 age than 51), recommending age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients's decision.
Jantian: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 over 0.27/100,000), as specified above.
Asrbidi and complications: Patients with COVID-19 that need loving care are more likely to experience acidic and arithmic injury.
The kardium problem is also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be bound to the positive ACE2 college that may lead to a heart disflicted in COVID-19 patients.
Also, it has been observed that hidden age and disease are related and that there are potentially disturbing activities.
Abnormal lab discovery: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in blood indicate ravity or tissue injury and has been recommended as potential prognosis for disease, responses to therapy and final recovery.
Connect the CRP level link to the state and the COVID-19 prognosis has also been recommended.
In addition, dehidrogenase lacts, aminotransferase aspartats, aminolanina aminotransferase (ALT), and growing kinase creativity (CK) can also help predicting decisions.
This enzyme is ripped into huge amounts of organs, especially those in the heart and heart, and was evicted from tissue damage.
Thus, it became a traditional marker for a heart or a heart.
The main clinical symptom: breast and clinical symptoms progress should be considered by time along with other issues to predict the consequences and CAVID-19 complications.
The use of steroids: As expressed above, steroids are commonly used as a synthetic therapy for infected diseases to reduce the damage of radiation.
The display of two corticsteroids has been used extensively in severe SARS patients, many of the former patients suffer from osteonecrosic acid with severe acidity of life and quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids must be used on low doses and for a short period in COVID-19 patients.
mental pressure: As mentioned above, during COVID-19 patients have suffered from extraordinary pressure because they are often faced with old quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and patient friends.
It's important to provide your psychology counsel and long-term support to help this patient recover from pressure and return to normal life.
According to demography research in a long way, COVID-19 looks like having a different epidemiology feature than SARS.
In addition to the double rhythm in the lower breathing cycle, the SARS-CoV-2 can double with efficiently in the upper respiratory salt and cause light symptoms or no simptoms in the initial jangkiting phases, the same as other CoV causes normal cerema.
Therefore, the patient infected at the initial phase or the duration can produce a large number of viruses during day - to - day activities, causing it to be very difficult to control epidemic.
However, theularization of SARS-CoV is thought to be happening during a bad illness, when most infections don't occur in the early phase.
So the current COVID-19 epidemic is much worse and hard to control than the SARS plague.
A great effort is running in China, including the warring order in Wuhan and the city around and the quarantine continued almost all the population with the hope of breaking SARS-CoV-2ularization.
Even though this action marshals economic and other sectors in the country, new patients are down, marking epidemicity.
The most optimistic estimate is that the plague will end at the end of Mac and the reduction phase will be running for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al, confirms that COVID-19, which seems much easier to bear than SARS, won't end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al, makes a model for predicting the epidemic result and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both middle turbinats and a strong patient who had healed and left hospital two weeks before, which marked that the new known virus could be repeated episods such as influenza.
However, a compelling signal occurred in China based on a number of coming downwards, showing that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola was originally predicted would cause a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with a severe quarantine and refining, the disease was finally controlled.
Therefore, just like SARS-CoV, maybe the SARS-CoV-2 infection has become weaker and finally ends or becomes less patogen viruss that exist with humans.
The comparison between COVID-19 epidemic and SARS and MERS is provided below (KOh55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily infected through cough or grenades, and can also be infected through direct contact with the material that has been infected with the virus.
The virus is also found in the unclean, which creates new possibilities about exposure from unclean to mouth.
The recent study of 138 has reported that 41% case may be caused by nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health officials.
So carefully guarding must be used to protect the people, especially health officials, social workers, family members, friends, even people on the road that deals with the patient or those who are infected.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of our stroke is using a face mask; both the use of the superhero mask and the N95 (rive # 1860) helps control the spread of the virus.
The operating mask prevents a liquid typing from a person who is possibly infected from being spread through disbanding or sticking on the surface of the material, the next one can be spread to others.
However, only the N95 type mask that can protect from the virion secrecy of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% vison that can penetrate N95 type mask; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same as SARS-CoV of sizes in which they both weigh less 85 nm.
Since the virus particles can penetrate five operating masks together, the health officials who have directly contact with the patient need to wear the N95 mask (the #1860s) instead of the operating mask.
In addition to the face mask, health officials need to use self - protection tools to reduce contact with the virus.
Virus affects individuals by an eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 even having had a N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes that suffered from a crash.
In that regard, health officials also need to wear the caretle of the transparency or the eye mirrors of security when facing a patient.
For the public in areas that are affected or possibly affected, it is advisable for all residents to wash their hands with regular baking soap, stay at home and reduce contact with people who are likely to be infected.
Three feet ’ distances were considered an appropriate distance from the patient.
These steps are an effective method in reducing infection risks besides preventing virus infections.
Even though SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, high homology for SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 warned China as the SARS plague hit in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020 Centre Control and Prevention of Disease Wuhan tried to reduce its citizens' concern by saying that this novel virus has a low infectivity rate and limited reproduction to humans and preventing and repelling disease is not a problem.
The message has been able to lessen the public's concern, especially when the whole country is making preparations for the Summer Festival, and it cannot be welcomed to block the ventilation of plague on the minimum scale of Wuhan.
The disease agency in China can take lessons from this and can make an improvement in the future.
For example, the agency evidently (1) is more careful in making an announcement to the public because of every detail that is given affecting the people's attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to extraordinary information received from clinics than waiting for a formal report than for doctors or employees; (3) more firm in flooding the plague than the public was abduct; and (4) more often practice to increase public awareness of the disease of epidemic disease and test and repair the social reaction system.
COVID-19ularation is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that starts at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it's been poking across China and nearly 50 countries around the world when this writing is made.
Since this virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and symptoms are also almost equal to SARS, COVID-19ularularization has created the sentence that the SARS plague has been repeated.
However, there's a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important in protecting epidemics and caring for patients.
COVID-19 affects the individuals rather than the young and more to the males than the women, the survival and death rates are also higher for older people than the bells.
SARS has a higher death rate than COVID-19 (10.91% than 1.4%).
COVID-19 patients can spread virus without having any symptoms while SARS patients spread viruses in a sick state, which causes difficulty in membling COVID-19ularity than SARS.
This explains the causes of SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
For example, the viruses exist in an area that is very likely to be viral.
This discovery indirectly increases the risk of virus infection.
Based on rapid progress in research on COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be framed, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homolog found on SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV like SARS bats, we can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is also coming from the bat.
What animal is the pulse that spread the virus from the housewife, for example bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to #1 and 2, we can't decide theularity with a sketch, and the plague can recurs at any time.
Even though the molecular model test and biokimia have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how can the virus actually enter the airline cells and the next cause patology changes?
Does the virus help bind ACE2 expression cells on other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot reach a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does this virus develop genetically through infection among mankind?
Is it going to be a pandemic around the world, erased like SARS or reverted periodically like the celema?
This is important but will take time to find answers to the above questions and other questions.
However, no matter what cost is in order, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and return our life to normal.
Human coronavirus zoonotics
Mutation and adaptation have led evolution along with coronavirus (CoV) and its main host, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoV (HcoV) had been known to cause minor illness, such as the flu.
The Currency Syndrome of Myth Accelerators and Central Eastern Releasing Syndrome has changed the view and exposed how HCoV is terrible and can pose a threat to life.
SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has drawn attention to CoV and surprises us with its easy infection but less patogenic than SARS-CoV.
The HCoV infection is zoonosis and understanding of the origin of the HCV zootics can help us.
Most HCoV is from a bat that is not patogenic.
The intermediate host for some HCoV is also known.
Identifying an animal host has an ongoing implication for prevention of human disease.
Investigation of CoV host interaction in animals allows the importance of understanding about CoV's patgenesis in humans acquired.
In this study, we're giving a whole picture of an existing knowledge involving seven HCoVs, with focus on its discovery and its origin of zoonotic and transminition between the species.
The important thing is to compare and distinguish the difference between the HCoV and the virus evolutional perspective and the regeneration of the genome.
Epidemic disease during COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange and the implications of the virus evolution of disease is also subjected.
Coronavirus (CoV) is from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a single group of rNA threads, positive, varieties.
The length of this genome is between 26 and 32 kilobase and is the biggest genome among the RNA virus and is given the name "CoV" because of its form of morphology that looks like a crown under electron microscope.
From the structure, CoV has an uncluttered genome that shares the same subscription.
The two-thirds of this genome have two large open read frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are lined together, which are later translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replication.
Poliprotein is then processed to produce 16 non-structure proteins, known as nsp1~16.
Genomics are made up of ORFs for instructor proteins, including packs (S), cover (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific protein accessory proteins are coded according to different CoV's nasabah.
Based on the difference of protein order, CoV is classified to four generas (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gama-CoV and delta-CoV), which is the result of most HCoV and divided into four sequences (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rats act as a gene source to most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of the gama-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has overcome the species barriers and some of them have appeared as a human patogen.
Until now, 7 human coronaviruss are known.
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 that is an alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoV is including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, bad rhythm respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Central Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 custom led to simple simptoms, such as celema and/or constellation.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that were known are definitely very patogenic, resulting in a bad ventilation channel, resulting in the lower sensation of patients who have high probability to get syndrome in acute respiratorytress (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestation.
The first HCoV-229E Strain, B814, has been discarded from a patient's nose disco in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through a broad research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both resulting in the independent control symptoms.
This concept has been widely accepted that the HCoV infection is harmless until the SARS epidemics appear.
The SARS Plague occurred in 2003 and was one of the worst ruins in history, infecting some 8,000 people with some 10% severe death rates.
Ten years later, Central Eastern breathing syndrome (MERS) caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with spooric spread throughout the world.
Novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is an agent that caused the continued coronavirus epidemic (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as 3 March 2020.
Warning has been given and the world needs to be prepared to face the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin of bats, rats and domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the origin of the whole HCov of bats, where the virus is adaptable and not patogenic but shows a great genetic diversity.
COVID-2019 Epidemic has brought huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the whole world.
The HCoV zoonotic original detection provides frames for original history so, alarm power and partition factors for species jumping.
It may also drive and make it easier to search for the hosts of the reservoir, the intermediate and packing for SARS-CoV-2, with an important application in the abundance of the time to come.
In this original study we unlocked the whole picture of the origin of the zoonotic, transmission between species and pat etógenesis of HCoV.
Especially, we preach and discuss the common theme where the HCoVvirion is not a patogenic in the reservoir is a host but became a patogen after interspesis transmitted to new hosts.
We also reexamine the direction of the HCoV evolutionary flow where the growth of transfection often appears with patogen declining.
The result of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 plague is discussed in this context.
CoV animal has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E strain B814 of a patient's nose discating, the different CoV has been emptied in various animals infected, including daggers, rats, bulls, pigs, cats and dogs.
In a few decades ago, seven HCoVs were identified.
A simple summary of HCoV discovery in chronology rule 1) can provide information and teaching.
The first HCoV-229E Strain has been separated from the patient infections of germs on the upper respiratory channel in 1966, and the next has been adjusted to grow in WI-38 lung cells lines.
The patient who is infected with HCoV-229E is seen with a cinema symptom, including headaches, sneezing, punches and throats, with fevers and coughs seen in 10~20% case.
And then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was excluded from the organ cult and the next arithmic quote in the infested mouse's brain.
The HCoV-OC43 infection image is seen similar to infection by HCoV-229E, which symptomically cannot be adjusted from infections with other respiratory channel patogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus virus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are scattered around the world and tends to contagiate more during winters in the simpler climate.
Normally, the period of watering these two viruses is less than a week, followed by disease for about two weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have a light-smoker.
Only a few terimunocommum patients show a bad bottom respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia athpical pneumonia", is the pandemic that was due to the first HCoV that was properly recorded in human history and his ethical agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Territory in China.
The SARS Epidemic led to 8.096 cases reported by 774 deaths, scattered in many countries and continents.
Besides super, it's asserted that every case can cause about two secondary cases, with a period of watering between 4 and 7 days and the free virus obsolete emerged on the 10th day of sickness.
The patient who was infected with SARS-CoV at first showed mialgia, headaches, fever, dedar and cold, followed by dispnea, cough and respiration as a late symptom.
Limfofenia, a deliberate heart function test and a growing kinase creativity is the normal abnormality of SARS lab.
Difused alveolar damage, epitelium cells development and makrofaj increases are also noted in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients then need mechanical care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the infection of the lower respiratory salt, various organs include the gastrousus salt, the heart and the pillow can also be infected in this bad case, often accompanied by the sitokin storm, which can cause death especially in the patients that are terimunopromi.
The virus was first separated from the open lung biopsy a brother to an index patient travelling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been made for HCoV investigation.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7- month of the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
At first, the virus was found widespread among the children, the gold citizens and the terimunomodized patients with respiratory diseases.
Coriza's presence, conjunction, fever and bronkiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another free study explained about the same virus seduction of a 8- month-old child's nasal specimen who suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although known in the Netherlands, the virus actually spread across the world.
It's noted that HCoV-NL63 was the cause of about 4.7% normal respiration disease and the time of the time when it was the start of summer, the spring and the winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HOV-HKU1 had been excluded from a 71-year-old man who had been sent to the hospital with pneumonia and bronkiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchilitis infected in community, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be associated with acute acid academy.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found all over the world, causing light respiration disease.
All four HCoVs infected in this community have been adapted well to humans and generally less possible to mutation and cause very patogenic disease, even though accidents have occurred for the unknown reason because there's been rarer cases of a minor HCoV-NL63 subtype, which recently reported has caused severe acquisition of respiratory rates in China.
Generally, when this HCoV gets the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuous in the human body, this virus also becomes less sinister or patogenic.
MERS-CoV was first exiled in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and psychiatrist failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases verified by the lab from the Middle East, the case imported by the occasional secondary injection to the meeting contact has been reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
Another second scourge occurred in South Korea in 2015 by the exact 186 case confirmed.
The clinical design for MERS is equal to the SARS, marked by the acute moniatic psychia.
Unlike the SARS, many patients with MERS have suffered a failure of acid waist, which is so far unique to the MERS between diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of the patient shows gastrousus symptoms, such as cemetery and vomiting.
As of February 14 of 2020, over 2500 cases confirmed by lab have been reported with a high case death of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruss that hit man.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, the pneumonia patient cluster was known to be related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been detected in Wuhan, Hubei Region, China.
The World Health Organization calls the disease COV-19, underfinal respiratory infections that are happening because of SARS-CoV-2 as the Public Health Security on International Levels and as part of the name of the COVID-19.
As far as Mac 2020, 90.053 cases have been reported throughout the world, with a ruthless death of 3.4%.
Ketara, the case death in Hubei, China is 4.2%, when the case death outside the area is 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 caused severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough, and dispnea.
The characteristics of the sheep also apply to some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the worst symptoms and can grow fast into a hard-breed syndrome.
Even though SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because the nucleotides of the high nucleotide is 82%, the virus is grouped into different foreheads on the filogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 seems less patogenic but more likely to be contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 subject has been reported and may be contributing to appropriateularity around the world.
Compares and separates SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs to a very interesting equation and difference.
First of all, the time of the plural and the duration of HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoV.
Secondly, the simptom COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four HCoV found of community (cth. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
From one face, the SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates the properties that are more often seen during infections by the HCoV found from the community, including unspecified symptom presence, light or no symptoms.
In other ways, the poor small subset of COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the SARS-CoV infection case, even though the ratio is low.
Third,ularization of SARS-CoV-2 also shows an interesting feature for both HCoVs found of Community and SARS-CoV.
From one point, the SARS-CoV-2 infection is at least the height of the HCoV found of the community.
In other ways, it's hard to confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 infections are declining after human beings like in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, just like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a shit sample.
Whether a unclean transfer into the mouth for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role like in the SARS-CoV case at least under certain circumstances waiting for enlightenment through research in the future.
It's also very interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 might start up by season like in the HCoV case that is infected in the community.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 features include infection, ethnicity and spread that are continuing after humans will affect the fate of the end of the COVID-19 COVID.
All four HCoVs infected in Community made light symptoms well adapt to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans who have adapted well to these four-three HCoVs.
In other words, both could have survived the old HCoV pandemic.
HOV, who caused severe human illnesses and humans suffering from a serious HCoV disease, was removed.
In order to allow this to happen, the HCoV has to double in humans until enough level to allow the grouping mutation to fit against a host partition factor.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague lasts and the more people infected, the greater the chances for that virus to adapt fully to humans.
If the virus is adapted well, itsularity in humans will be difficult to block with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, four CoVs who were infected in community circulated in human population, sparked common flues in the terimunompromi subject.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted to humans well and the virusularity in humans can't be preserved.
The virus needs to remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoir and seek an opportunity to spread to the vulnerable human target, perhaps through one or more intermediate and reproductive hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same feature as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the fourth HCoV that is infected in Community.
It's very easily contagious like HCoV infected in community, at least at this time.
However, the virus is more patogenic than HCoV that is infected in Community and less patogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will be fully adapted to humans and spread among humans without reservoir or intermediate hosts.
Before talking about the origins of the animal that became the source of HCoV, we better discuss definitions and properties of evolutionary hosts, so, reservoirs, intermediate and provider HCoV.
A animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if he has a very close heir that shares high homology at the nucleotides rate.
The blood virus is usually well adapted and not patogenics in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host keeps HCoV constantly and for long-term.
In both cases, the host is usually naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or his viion.
On the other hand, if a new HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt properly to new hosts and usually patogenics.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source for human infections and plays a role as a reproductive host by justifying the virus for a while and then spreading the virus to mankind to strengthen human scale of human infections.
HCoV can experience a death road infection if it can't keep its infection in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and help create long-term intensity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
The epidemiology data revealed indiscriminately that the SARS index case has a history of contact with the hunted animals.
The next seroprevalens investigation shows that animal seller has an anti-SARS-CoV IgG prevalent higher than the public.
The mong lamri (Murderma larvata) and the dog in the first-living animal market must have been known to bring viruss such as SARS-CoV that are almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly with the fact that no SARS reported again after killing all the musangs in the market.
However, it has been reported that the pharmaceutical musang from the woods or the fields without exposure to the animal market lives most negative SARS-CoV, suggesting that the moangs may only be an intersection host but not reservoiring to SARS-CoV.
Most obvious, considering 80% of the different animals in the market at Guangzhou has anti-SARS-CoV antibodi, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also be able to support intersectioning hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
All of this seems to be a dead street host for SARS-CoV.
The next search for the original animal host so for SARS-CoV to expose the connected CoV bat, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) the Rhinolophus bat is related to SARS, which exists in China's lace bats.
This bat is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genes.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92% nucleotid homology rates with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for the new concept that the bat hosts produce a human pathogen.
Some CoV such as SARS (SL-CoVs) has also been identified from bats, but nothing except one named WIV1 can be excluded as a living virus.
Human angiotension change engine 2 (ACE2) is known as recipients for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a bat's unclean sample is shown using bats, musangs and ACE2 humans as a receiver for cell entry.
More interestingly, healthy SARS patients have been found capable of neutralizing WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related offspring for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of nuclear forward homology.
Even though there's a high homology between these two viruss, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and bats are not a live SARS-CoV reservoir host.
Phylogenetic analysis put MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bat using the same host reciper, synchronized ptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
Polimerase RNA sequence depends on the RNA of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in the versus-coV bats known from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV lives can be found in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and the closest family of CoV-Hku25 bats share only 87% nucleotides' homology.
So the bat may not be a live reservoir host to MERS-CoV.
Instead, research in the Middle East shows that arab camel has a positive effect on the special autographing antibodi MERS-CoV, just like a camel in the Middle East from various African countries.
MERS-CoV lives similar to the virus found in humans have been excluded through arab unta, next shows that the camel works as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It also needs to be noted that most simple symptoms but large viral bullets have been observed on camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Particularly, camels that are infected release the virus not only through the breathing path but also through the waist path, which is also the path to the virus released from the bat.
Anyway, the matter remains since many valid MERS cases have no contact history with camels before simptoms begin, the possibility of the human spread path to mankind or the unknown preaching path involving an unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% homologous nukleotida with CoV RaTG13 bats separated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the severation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
In a sense, bats may not be the nearest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 but the almost similar CoV bat was found in the future.
Maybe, intermediate hosts to SARS-CoV-2 are from the wild species sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Borong Seafoot market, associated with many early cases COVID-19, showing the possibility of a spreading animal event to humans.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that small mammals who are threatened as tenggling can also store descendants of SARS-CoV-2.
This CoV tenggiling Genom shares 85-92% of nucleotid homology rates with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they're connected to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the nucleotides rate.
They're gathered in two subs of the viruss like SARS-CoV-2 in the pilogenetic tree, one of which shares the prescriptives domains that are more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of amino acids.
In the real difference, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more distorted, even though there's a degree of higher homology rate.
Previous research on the infected tenggling also reported the viral contig detection of the lung sample, which was then found to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study uses a grouping method and select manual layout to generate a part of the partial genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full virus genome.
We can't deny the possibility that the tenggling is one of the intermediate animals hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, at this time, there's no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 from the constant ventilation of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV related to SARS-COV-2 tenggiling.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV related to SARS-COV-2 tenggiling.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutional path in bats, tenggling and other mammals still need to be set.
While the highest homology order has been found in the RBD between SARS-COV-2 and thugling, beta-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 shared the highest-genom accelerated homology.
A strong speculation states that the high level equation between RBDs from the beta-CoV corresponds SARS-2 thugling and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by evolution based on an optional reference.
A favored response to the recombination between the SARS-CoV-2 collaboration and RaTG13 species of wild animals.
As the power of the evolutionary driver, the merger is widespread in the co-CoV beta.
The research is still being done about the origin of the immediate zoonotic SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the very patogenic HCoV-229E zoontic, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been tested.
Phylogenetic evidence shows both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be from CoV bat, while the victor HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 has been found in a mouse.
It has been reported that CoV bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the three North American color bats show a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another CoV bat, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, that has been detected in Ghana, when the camelid was also suspected as intermediate host.
To make it clear, the current knowledge of the origin of an animal of the known HCoV is formulated in Diagram 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoVularization among the species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 respites species to infect humans of domestic animals about 1890, breathing infection pandemics have been recorded.
The history of HCoV-229Eularization between species is vague.
But the bat-CoV alpha is connected to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them are alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some lines of evidence support virusularity from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpaka may have contact with bats in shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpaka.
Secondly, bat alpha-CoV relates to HCoV-229E is a variety and not patogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV alpaka generates respiratory diseases in infected animals
Finally, alpaka alpha-CoV is not found on wild animals.
So it's possible that alpaka has an alpha-CoV corresponding HCoV-229E from humans.
The truth is, bat is the direct source of human patogen viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah, and the Hendra virus.
So it's not that bats can move HCoV-229E to humans directly.
As an alternative, even though the bat-coV is into the depth of the HCoV-229E gene, the alpaka and the unta may be the intermediate host that transfers the virus to mankind, really like in the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is the best example ofularity between the species of bats to the camels and the arab camels to humans.
The original MERS-CoV Evolution of the bat was known at the start of the introduction and was strengthened with the next discovery.
It is clear that the bat provides the bottom of the species of virus to exchange genetic fractions between species andularity between species.
Long age, dense colony, close social interactions and strong flying skills are all the things that encourage bats to be the ideal virus plant.
Besides, MERS-CoV has been introduced to the arab camel during the free-dekad.
It adapts well to these camels that have turned from intermediate hosts to stable reservoir hosts and returned to it.
MERS-CoV causes a very lighter disease and maintains a low mutation rate relatively in this animal.
His spectrumularularity to humans is accidental and man remains as the final host to MERS-CoV because hisularity cannot be maintained.
Contrasts the camel functions in the MERS-CoV spread, the tenggiling function, if available, in SARS-CoV-2ularity is different.
Particularly, I'm co-coV tenggling is very patogenic in the twiggling.
They're probably the last host to be-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2, the same as the musangs in the SARS-CoV case.
Some possibilities for theularization of SARS-CoV-2 of the species of animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in the study of the future.
First, the bat can be a reservoir host for the virus related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological niche with bats through a trade or a mining of rock.
Secondly, the tenggling can be one of the new intermediate hosts known by the SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans are infected with viruses through the trade and eat the animals of the wild.
Maybe many mammals include domestic animals exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, recollection and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have been happening in the third species that have contact with both bats and thumbs.
The original animal search for SARS-CoV-2 is still continuing.
In addition to the different kind of host animals, the three main factors in the viral are also important in making CoV pass through species barriers.
First of all, relatively high mutation rates in RNA marking.
Compared to a single threading RNA virus, CoV mutation rates that are suspended can be considered "simple" to "high" with average exchange rates are ~10-4 exchange rates per year each 2 base, depending on CoV adaptation phase to novel hosts.
CoV has an exoribucleas of pruf reading, the determination causes very high variables and weakening or perhaps the absence of life.
Interestingly, the nuologist of Remdesivir is known to press CoV's marking through this exorruclease and RNA polimerase that depends on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical experiments.
Even so, CoV mutation rate is about a million times higher than the host.
Besides, mutation rates are usually high when CoV doesn't adapt properly to hosts.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, mutation rates on SARS-CoV-2 seem low, suggesting high adaptation rates to humans.
Perhaps he has already adapted to another host that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this is also used to MERS-CoV, who adapt well with arab camel.
Theoretically, it's impossible that generates will make vaccine and antiviruss against SARS-CoV-2 are insensitive within a short period of time.
Secondly, the biggest RNA genome in CoV uses extra paralysis in genome changes for mutation and recombination, and increases the probability of evolution along with the species, which is useful for the appearance of CoV novels when the state is appropriate.
This is supported by the unique open literature frame and the function of proteins encoded toward the end of 3' genomes.
Third, CoV changed the template randomly and frequently during RNA marking through the unique "tiru-select" mechanism.
In a host that works as a former mixer, the thread switch often occurs during the RNA CoV transcryption.
RNA subgenom and very full homolog can be rejoined to produce new CoV.
The phylogenetic evidence of revival so has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals like SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The virus host interaction is related to infection.
In addition to three virus factors expressed above, virus interaction with a host reception is another major factor that affects theularity of the species.
Here, the SARS-CoV relocation is taken as a special example, which also indicates positive options during the exposure of the species.
Based on a comparison between a human seduction and a SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV thought to be a quick adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations at RBDs on S proteins.
Generally, the RBD on a S protein on CoV interacts with cells and is elected strongly by host antibodies.
In the SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318 amino acid to the S1 piece, which binds to ACE2 humans and the receptions together for the virus entry.
RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 reciper of various animals, including bats, musangs, rats and raccoons, allowing the spread of virus between species.
The truth is that only 6 amino acids are noted as different from the seizing of human viruses and musangs in the RBD and 4 of them are located in the motive of the recipeer for interaction with the ACE2 reception.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N mutation and S487T on his RBD, which may increase the interaction of the pacax proteins with the human ACE2 recipe.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important to adapting virus to humans.
Should be taken prompt that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same prescriptive cells as SARS-CoV.
30% of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S proteins gives the impression that this SC2 protein connection with the human ACE2 might have been changed.
Indeed, cryo-EM research shows this bond that 10 to 20 times higher than the ACE2 human and SARS-CoV S.
It's also interesting to determine if any receptionor is together may be needed to spread SARS-CoV-2.
More interesting, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different S parts.
There are many other HCoV recipients that exist, such as aminoptadase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O synonymic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It's probably responsible for the successful adaptation of CoV in humans after the infection of the species between its animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receivers, the exposure between the HCoV species also depends on host dependence and other barriers.
These protein proteins between humans and reservoir hosts so HCoV like bats, arab camel and roden may create barriers toularity between species.
The HCoV needs to seize host dependency factor and modify the host partition factor for succession of the species.
In this case, the molecular separators in the important area of these virus interactions are still unrecognizable and characterized.
The network around the unreligious genome for host dependency and partition factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology may produce results.
Notification of novel HCoV: return to startup
CoV bat's diversity gave us a wide chance to perform the HCoV novel.
From this point, the bat CoV acted as the HCoV gen pool.
In addition, quick mutation and genetic recombinants also trigger the HCoV evolution and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, decoding or losing novel protein encoding genes has the potential to change viral fenotip suppnotically.
Between SARS-CoV protein accessory, ORF8 has been considered as important in adaptation to humans, because the cross virus of SARS-CoV has been excluded, but it has been found to encoded the scaling ORF8 protein.
The nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV feature has been found in the strain that was excluded at the beginning of human epidemic.
This extermination separates ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered as a modification mutation that encourages host exchange.
Besides, SARS-CoV has the possibility of a recompact history with an alpha and gama CV, which a large number of smaller recombination regions have been identified in RNA polimerase depending on RNA.
The recoding location is also known in nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to experience a recombination between different descendants, which happened in arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it's also noted in another HCoV, who sees HCoV joining with other animals in the genes instead of its structure.
Warning is also to be warned that false selections can contribute to unwitting changes in the virus genome, which are likely to result from freeing the virus from the pressure of the given selection, such as the host immune system.
One example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 full length in the HCoV-229E prototype thread, due to the extinguishing of two nucleotides.
While the ORF4 solid can be seen in bat virus and camels associated with HCoV-229E, alfa-CoV alpaka's alpaka shows a single nucleotides insertion, which produces a skeleton.
Finally, the HCoV novel evolution was also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
The amptom or light symptoms were detected only when CoV infected bats, marking the adjustment together between CoV and bat.
It seems that anatomics and psychology are properly adapted to CoV.
For example, the damage in the deficiency of the pro-composition response in bats efficiently reduces the patologies expressed by CoV.
In addition, the original murder cell activity is kept in bats due to the increase in the regenency of the reproduction of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression for the first class molecular complex of histoness.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species generated from the high bat metabolism activity can both hold CoV's markings and disrupting literature by exoriboclease, while pressing the selection to patogenic virus control when introduced to new hosts.
More CoV patogenic strains may also evolve through relocation, bringing to the processing of a novel protein or a feature of protein for host adaptation.
So it's not a coincidence that three HCoV novels had appeared in the past two decades.
CoV is not a patogenic or makes a light symptom in their reservoir hosts like bats and camels.
It doubled fast without a strong host response.
This is where the secret of the amptomatic bearer is seen and the cause of a bad case in human infections.
The worst simptoms are due to hypothers' immun responses and sitokin storms where immun responses are stronger, worse lung damage.
On the other hand, in the amptomatic bearer, the immun response has been interfered from CoV's marking.
Same strategy that deactivate immun responses may have a useful effect on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responds are very powerful in bats.
Therefore, interferons of type 1 is at least in early SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans should be useful.
Besides, inflammation in bats is not effective.
For this reason, the interaction of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in caring for COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 softness follows the common theme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although the bat-CoV bell share 95% of nuclear homological homicide with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also CoV bats that share 96% of nuclear hometics with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the musangs and other animals at the market have been found having a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 is not identified.
Beta-CoV tenggiling very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 was found, signaling that the tenggling may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV coggiling can donate gene fragments to the end version SARS-CoV-2.
Even though there's a question, there's no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by humans intentionally or accidentally.
CoV has been back in focus because of SARS-CoV-2 recently.
The study of CoV in the bats and other animals has drastically changed our view of the origin of zoonotics and animal reservoirs for HCoV in humanularity.
The thorough evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have its original from bats and transferred to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection has been traced from human contact with the musang at the market, closing the wet market and killing the musang should be able to end SARS epidemic with effectiveness.
For the same reason, tenggling had to be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonoticularularularularularity, because multiple progeny-coV tenggling procures connected to SARS-CoV-2.
Still, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 are transferred to humans through the twilight and other mammals need to be explained in the future investigation.
Instead, MERS-CoV has existed in the arab camel for a long time.
This camel has become an important tool for transportation and a major source of meat, milk, skin, and fur products for local society.
This camel is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as they were charged at the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent reenularization of MERS, a thorough approach must be taken to wake the effective vaccine to oppose the MERS-CoV for the camel, which is combined with other jangkit control steps.
Since we cannot remove this virus, new genotips may appear to cause plague.
CoV's zoonotics are scattered in the woods.
Especially, CoV bat with zoonotic potential is very different.
There are many opportunities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and reenact, making new CoV's appearance more likely to be contagious and/or can kill within humans in the future.
Business eats wild animals in some places in China must be stopped to reduce unnecessarily human and animal contact.
With the hardest experiences of the SARS, MERS and COVID-19, preparations and better response plans have to be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet long ago.
The virus remains in the reservoirs so that there's a chance to contagie.
Although bats have many features that make it easier to spread the virus, human chances of having contact with the bats and other wild species can be memorized if society is educated to avoid that animal.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is a need to understand CoV and its original ecological, which will prove useful in preventing animalularity to humans and future plagues.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoonosis is with humans from reservoiring ecological hybrids so for zoonotic viruses.
Some of the things that are a matter of the origin of the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 is still unanswered.
First, if a bat infected the SARS-CoV-2 legacy virus to the twilight, it'll be interesting to see how bats and thumb can share the same ecological nic.
Secondly, if bats play more positive roles in exposure to humans, we have to determine how humans get contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way he interacts with different species including humans, bats, and thumbs need to be explained.
Finally, since many mammals include exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and infections need to be carried out.
Whether bats, twigs or other mammals are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or similar parent virus will be identified in the original hosts in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will explain the SARS-CoV-2 evolutional path in animals, with important implications in prevention and COVID-19 control in humans.
Updating now the diagnostic "kes" and "cas verified" for COVID-19 required
On February 6, 2020, our team has published a quick guideline for diagnosis and jangkitation of coronavirus novels 2019 (19-nCoV), and this guideline provides our experience as a good reference to resisting this pandemic in the world.
Still, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, consciousness and knowledge grow slowly according to the ongoing research findings that are running and clinical practice experience; so, diagnostics and treatments are also updated now.
In this letter, we have answered a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "sufficient case" and "the case" according to the 17th Diagnostic Guideline and the 17th COVID Rawating (7) issued by the Chinese Republic's National Health Committee.
In December 2019, the coronavirus novel 2019 (19-nCoV) had caused a plague, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been called the bad acute acute acid syndrome of a coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11th March 2020, WHO announced COVID-10 as pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has erected a quick advice line and the guide has been published in the 06 February 2020 Satelligence.
That guide has been very interesting since published.
However, please inform you that COVID-19 is a new illness, our awareness and knowledge grow slowly according to the current research findings that are running and clinical practice experience; so, the strategy and the treatment to continue to update.
For example, the Guideline Diagnostics and Rawatstics for COVID-19 issued by the Chinese Republican Republical Committee (htttp://www.nc.gov.cn/), between January 2020 and 3 Mac 2020, have issued a number of editions with some legally changed contexts.
Now our guideline accepts comments by Zhou et al, they introduce simplemarking suggestions based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guideline and also become a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We recognized their important efforts and thanked them.
However, their efforts also require updates now by the Diagnostic Guidelines and Rawatans for COVID-19 (the seventh instance of testing) the latest and most recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 Mac 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires a combination of any item of the history of epidemiology with two clinical manifestation items to produce a thorough analysis, or to meet three clinical manifestation items if without clear epidemiology history:
Epidemiology history: (1) Travel or travel history or live in the city of Wuhan and environment, or other society where COVID-19 cases are reported in 14 days before simptoms begin; (2) history of contact with SAR-CoV2 jangkitations (with positive nucleic acid tests; (3) history corresponding to patients with fevers or symptoms from the city of Wuhan and around, or around the region, or another Community where COVID-19 were reported in 14 days before the simptom; (4) the history of clusterys (ens / 2/s/s/s/comps/camps in the period in short period 2 weeks, in the period, the school class, the school.).
Manifestation clinical: (1) fever and/or symptom breathing; (2) with COVID-19 jangkiting properties; (3) the number of white blood cells indicates normal, decreasing, or reduced limfosit count at the beginning.
Diagnostics of the verified case must depend on a case that is believed to any patogenic item or ciologial evidence such as: (1) a positive time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the total vimity genes show high homogenity to the known coronavirus novel; (3) positive to IgM and antibodi IgM and antibodiG which is special to SARV-2 in test; or IdiG special ig-SRSR-CoV2 conversion from negative, or fiber-CoV to the negative reces of fasa in my fasa.
We can see that the real time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory channel or blood samples has been added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (June 22, 2020).
Patogenic detection of blood samples has been inserted into the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then the serological evidence was put into the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the ongoing work of researchers who search for the optimum nuctical acid detection of nucleic acid detection, and samples from the respiratory channel include blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and supports the positive resulting of the antibodies in the verified criteria.
In addition, there's a lot of evidence that reminds us of guarding with a psychic or accematical patients.
So the flow chart from Zhou et al. It has to be updated now, as they set up invivu without clinical symptoms as "low-sweet."
The score system also needs to be confirmed in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and call the reader to give a comment.
To diagnostic to the suspected "cakes" and "cakes verified", we suggest to detect and obey the new guideline of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline from time to time to offer help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death rate in a day due to the virus.
Until last night, the Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Research of the Wabak Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported the amount of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 healthy cases sitting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In the cover of online news, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death includes four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are above 60, two of them 51 and 60, and 41-50 years.
He also told two victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 as a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials tell one of the local news sources, Anadolu Agency that one of the diseases is Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Commissioner Anti Rasuah Bengali, who was treated at the Kuwait Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Wall Minister and the Bridge of Bangladesh, Obadul Quader said that public transportation would be closed longer than the original planning, until Saturday would come.
This public transport was originally started on March 26 and was designed to finish Saturday, 4 April.
Transportation of important items -- medicine, oil and food -- still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection encoded in Bangladesh is on 8 Mac, in two people who return from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
As far as 19 Mac, the three have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 is more than a million infections all over the world.
At Thursday, the total number of U.S.-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million throughout the world, according to the data from the Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, an epidemic that's overgrown from coronavirus.
This level sign was present on the same day Malawi confirmed the first infection of the coronovirus and Zambia had the first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea claims, until Thursday, it is among some countries that are free of coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 cases confirmed, including 79.332 cases in twenty-four hours leading the 10 morning Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases are reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS news reported, quoting from Johns Hopksins University data, over 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Throughout the world, countries announce more strict steps to stop the plague from spreading.
At Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, the chief city of Moscow, extended the city's cover until 1 May.
In all the country, President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russians to continue paid without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's Parliament voted to extend emergencys to 15 days; votes confirmed by 215 votes support, ten exceptions, and one block.
The Saudi Arab held the order in the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah to the whole day; before this, the order of the collar was applied only between three o’clock and 6 in the morning.
Thailand has planned to carry out the collar order between 10 nights and 4 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the order of sitting at home until 1 May.
Engineers in Australia lowered the toilet limit once manage this.
On Sunday evenings and Saturdays, the chain of Australia Woolworths and Coles's stores dropped their purchase restrictions on toilets to two and one packets once manage each in all the stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced the limit of one pack, on Monday.
This limit is broadcast as a message on the exit list, and on the Facebook page the chain.
The buyer reported buys stock because of COVID-19 fear if individuals need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also confiscated the purchase of a toilet toilet for delivery to one pack every message.
This change follows the four-packing partition for each of these businesses introduced by Woolworths and Coles each at 4 and 5 Mac.
Coles, in the media broadcast on 8 Mac, reported that with the application of four packing partitions, "many stores are still running out of stock in an hour after delivery", and calls the request as "never occurred", while ALDI, in Facebook delivery on Tuesday, called "unbelievable".
The sales rose in "a sudden" last week, according to Woolworths spokeswoman.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
In order to keep the lowness of Coles, the Coles takes a bigger package than the provider and improves the delivery frequency, Woolworths for additional stocks, while ALDI makes stock for special Wednesday plans can be obtained early.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Constitution, said that the voter tried to add a stock but the local party partition at the time of delivery by the truck made it difficult.
He's expecting a compensation of product, when the supplier is trying to fulfill a request, and a little special.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that the following early stock releases, some stores were not allowed to run special Wednesdays.
In News.com.au's report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a runtimer scholar of the Queensland technology University, said that the store's suspending stock every night.
He told me the toilet is a big item, bringing to a low quantity at a stock sum, and, when it was sold, leaving the large, empty shelf room, strengthening the feelings of need.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if the product like a toilet tus and an ossuary material can [believe] and have quantity, you might slow down the panic of Russell Zimmerman on ABC News.
Producer of the toilet signals relived the publishers who gave a Crap on Wednesday and then they're running out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Tandas Kleenex, and Solaris Paper who made Sorbent, asserted that they worked 24/7 for supply, according to the New.com.au report.
Domain.com, estate site, reported some real estate dealer offering free-bourne markers to the first delivery at Melbourne's extended session, when a small amount of alongation is held by the buyer's going on off-day holidays at the Pekerja Day.
The NT News Thursday edition, the daily print in Darwin, inserts eight pages of an additional letter intended to be cut and used as a toilet tusu.
The shops on the original refused to wear a partition, according to a report from the Australian ABC on 3 Mac who witnessed they said they had no plan to introduce the limit to purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also got high requests, including masks, boiling materials, dry foods, washing hands and floors.
Same outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the Ocado's market on the Ocado line appears to limit Andrew's toilet buying to two rolls of 12.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 as pandemic
On Wednesday, the world's CO-19 COD COVID is happening — a disease that follows from the SARS-CoV-2 coronary — as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemik" means only where disease has spread, not how dangerous that particular case is, WHO realizes the need to urge the government to act:
All nations can still change this pandemic course.
If the country detects, tests, cares, separates, moves and moves their people to action, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director of WHO.
We're so worried about both stages of infectation and volatile and unsatisfied levels.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center Center and Prevention of Disease, the pandemic "never happened before."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "slain from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the appearance of the spread of the whole world that is continuing.
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen before a pandemic injected by coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen before a pandemic can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic was followed by the WHO in January to announce the epidemic as a public health emergency in the international level.
Director of the U.S. Institute of Loss and Criminal Infectious, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the plague, "The short word, things are going to get worse."
So far as Thursday, Associated Press reported there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemik 2019–20 is the magnitude of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is running because of a bad coronavirus acid syndrome, 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
It was known in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as General Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and was declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
For 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases COVID-19 have reported in 210 countries and regions, causing about 97,000 deaths.
About 364.000 people have recovered.
Case rate has been summarized by 4% in China, while in the world between 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
The common symptoms include fever, coughs, and breath packed.
Complications may include pneumonia and syndrome in acute respiratory.
The time of exposure to the start of the symptom is usually about five days, but it is possible to be between two and twelve days.
No vaccosis or known antivirus treatments.
The main concern is symptom and support therapy. The prevention suggested includes washing hands, shutting down the rhythms, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and scanting for those who suspect themselves being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by running travel partitions, quarantines, collars, dangerous controls at work and the collection of facilities.
This pandemic has caused global socioeconomic disorders, disposing or dissociating sports events, religious, political and culture, and a widespread deficiency of the purchase of panic.
Schools and universitys have been closed either across the country or at local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students population.
Incorrect information about the virus has spread online, and there are the xenofobia incidents and discrimination against the Chinese, other people are born, and the appearance of East and Southeast Asia, and they're from the area with the obvious virus case.
As a result of the devastation and heavy industrial closing, there are declining in air pollution and carbon release.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China, reported pneumonia pneumonia case cluster from the cause unknown on December 31, 2019, and the investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of that case has to do with the Huanan Sea Borong Food market and caused the virus to be thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the plague was known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that was just found connected to the coronavirus of the bat, the coronavirus of the twigling, and the SARS-CoV. The earliest known people were found to have been sick on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent connection with the wet market clustery later.
For the early cluster of the case reported in December 2019, the two thirds were found to have a connection with the market.
On March 13th, 2020, an unordered report from South China Morning Post suggests that a case detected back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from the Hubei region, may have been the first case.
Maybe there's a number of cases not reported matching, especially among them with lighter simptoms.
Until 26 February, relatively few cases that have been reported among teenagers, with those 19 years of age and below equal 2,4% cases worldwide.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and the tests have been confirmed positively according to official protocols.
As far as 23 Mac, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official bases not to test those who have a light symptom, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 Mac found that in China, up to January 23, an 86% of COVID-19 infections has not been detected, and that this infection is the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistic analysis published in 30 Mac asserts that the number of infections in Italy is greater than the case reported.
The initial estimate of the increase number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of Disease formulated that number might be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recovered.
For no one, the time of the simptom development to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common of it is 14 days.
For 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths are among those over 60 years of age, and 75% has a health problem existing including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The number of real deaths than COVID-19 may be much higher, because maybe not including those who died without testing - eth. at home, in the care center, etc.
Separate data from Italy found that the number of deaths overweight during that pandemic over the official COVID death count with factor 4-5x.
Women's spokesman for A.S. Center Control and Prevention of Disease. (CDC) states "We know that [all of the specified deaths] is less mapping", the statement supported by a report on less count in the A.S.
The first death outside the mainland of China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14, which came in February 14.
Up to February 28 out of China, over a dozen deaths of every country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until 13 Mac, over forty countries and regions have reported death, on every continent except Antarctica, some steps have been used in common to express the quantity of death.
This number is different from the area and according to time, and is influenced by the number of tests, health care controls, treatment quality, time since early epidemics, and the characteristics of populations such as age, sex, and whole health.
According to the University statistics of Johns Hopkins, the ratio of death with global cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) by 10 April 2020.
The number is different according to the area.
In China, budgets for death ratio by lowering 173% (for them with a symptom starting 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for them with simptoms start after 1 February 2020). Other drugs include cases death rates (CFR), which describe their percent being diagnosed by disease, and the rate of infection (IFR), which describes their percent of infected (diagnostics and unabdiagnostics) of disease.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow special populations from infections through cases solutions.
A number of academicists have tried to count this number for special population.
The Ubatan Center established the Oxford University Evidence asserts that the rate of infections for the pandemic is overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate for this range is the consistency of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistics study that analyzes test effects on a CFR budget.
WHO asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The period of the peaks and the climax of the plague is unsure and can be different according to the location.
The Boni Maciej of the Penn State University states: "It is permitted not to be checked, the infected epidemic is usually multiplying and then it begins decreasing when the disease is out of available home.
But it's almost impossible to make any reasonable encouragement now about the time of the situation."
The right medical adviser of the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan argued that "pandemik can end up near June" if all nations can be moved to follow WHO's advice about steps to stop the virus.
On 17 Mac, Adam Kucharski from London's Clean school and Tropica Ubat said that SARS-CoV-2 would continue, maybe for a year or two.
According to the Imperial College study headed by Neil Ferguson, physical and other steps will be needed "until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University states, "I don't think it's possible this coronavirus-- 'cause it's very easy to bear--it's going to be completely lost" and it's "may be a seasoned disease, come back every year."
The growth of the return will depend on the immunity of the group and the mutation level.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecified and people who are infected may be as a symptom.
Two most common simptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory supplier income, loss of smell, panic breath, headaches and joints, throat pain, headaches, coldness, hemoptisis, hemoptisis, cinema, or syanosis. WHO states that about one of six people is very sick and having difficulty in breathing.
The Centre Control and Prevention of Disease (CDC) A.S. lists emergency symptoms as breathing trouble, pain or pressure on an ongoing chest, sudden error, hard to wake up, and eyes or lips become catastrophics; medical treatments are immediately advised if these symptoms exist. The next disease growth can lead to a bad condition, syndrome in the acid, the syndrome in the acid, the shock, the shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be as symptoms, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infections, so researchers have given advice that they have to have their contacts with those infected should be monitored close and checked to ensure no infections.
China suspends the ratio of the amptomatics from a little to 44%.
The period of normal creeping (time between infections and simptoms) starts from one to 14 days; the most common of five days. As an example of uncertainty, the breakdown of the COVID-19 who loses their smell at first 30% and then falls to 15%.
A number of details about how the disease is being determined.
This disease is believed to be poised mainly during a meeting contact and through a small typhoon produced during a cough, circumference, or talk; with a close contact at a distance from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Kajian has found that an unprotected rock leading to the point of moving down to 15 feet (15 feet) to 1,2 feet (2,7 ft).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transferred through a small, long-term titis in the air, which may be generated in the day of speech.
The Titisan could land in the mouth or nose of the people nearby or may be dragged into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonari (CPR) can cause respiratory reinstation to be diverted and result in an air - bearing witnessing.
The virus could also be spread when someone touched an unclean surface, including the skin, and then touched their eyes, their noses, or mouths.
Although there is any viral concern that can spread through unclean, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the probability of injection into the mouth of SARS-CoV-2.Virus is the most easily infected during the first three days after the simptom, but infection may occur before symptoms appear and then at the stage for the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease until three days before the symptom began, suggesting that infection can occur before it exists a obvious symptom.
Just a few ascemptomatic cases confirmed by labs exist, but assembling tomatomaticalularularity was identified by some countries during contact detection investigation.
The Centre of Prevention and Control of European Disease (ECDC) says that even though it is not so clear how easy it is, one is usually infecting two to three others.
Specifically, the virus has been detected for three days at plastic (polipropilena) and rust - resistant shells 304 for a day on a cardbod, and for four hours on copper.
This, however, is different according to the humidity and temperature, the pets and other animals have been tested positively for COVID-19.
There's no evidence that animals can transfer viruss to humans, but the British authorities advise to wash hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Bad recession syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus novel, beginning to be separated from three people who have pneumonias associated with kluster cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to crownviruses in nature, outside the human body, the virus was killed by the soap, which destroyed his protective gloves.SARS-CoV-2 is very close to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the geneticly clustered crownvirus is with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the Sarbecovirus subgenus (son of B) along with two threads that were obtained from the bats.
The virus is 96% similar to the level of the genome full of the other coronavirus bat samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference between amino acids in a particular part of the genome sequence of viruses from ventilating with viruss from humans.
The whole genome difference until now found the most 92% genetic material shared between the tenggling coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove the squandering as intermediate homes.
The infection by the virus can be diagnosized for a while based on symptom, even though the businessman finally goes through the transcryption turn the reaction of the polimerase chain (rRT-PCR) for the infected reses or CT.
A study that compares the PCR with the CT in Wuhan suggests that the CT is obviously more sensitive than the PCR, even though less specific, with most of the features of its interest is overlapping with pneumonia and other diseases.
As far as Mac 2020, American Radial collaboration recommends that "CT shouldn't be used to filter or as the first line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published some RNA test protocol for SARS-CoV-1, with the first release on January 17,
The test used a turning transcryption reaction of the current polimerase chain (rRT-PCR).
This test can be run on a respiratory sample or a blood.
Test results are not available in just a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is run with a nasofaringeal swab of the throat, but it can also be used. A number of labs and companies are building a serology test, which detects antibodi.
As far as April 620, none of this test has proved sufficiently suitable for an extensive use.
In the U.S. serological tests built by the Cellex have been proposed for the use of emergencys by verified labs.
The properties of identifying properties on radiographs and computing tomographers (CT) for a sketching oang include unavailable asimtricished glass relief and pleura efusiation.
The Italian Radology union is collecting the databases in the airline to search for confirmation of the verified case.
The result of delay with other infections such as inovirus, the tnpa verification by the PCR has a limited array in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in China compares the CT's breast decision to the PCR and shows that even though it's less specific for infection, it's faster and more sensitive, suggesting the method's consideration as a filter tool in the epidemic area.
The rotation nerve network based on artificial intelligence has been built to detect virusized ciiiimation with both radiographs and CT.
The strategy to prevent disease from infection includes keeping the whole cleanliness, washing your hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and rubbish or squeezing on the tissue and putting it into the trash.
Those who may have already been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in the public.
Physical prison steps are also suggested to prevent infections, and many governments have restricted or advised to avoid any unnecessary trips to or from the countries and areas affected by the plague.
Still, the virus has reached the level of infection in the major part of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in Community, and some communists don't know where or how they are infected.
The use of the location data from the cell phone by the government for this purpose has raised concern about privacy, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issue the fact that requests the limit on this surveillance.
Multiple mobile apples have been run or suggested for volunteer use, and as of April 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts groups are working on friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to check close a user with other cell phones.
The user then accepts the message if they have been contacted with someone who has been tested positively for COVID-19.
No COVID-19 vaccine, even though many organizations are trying to wake the vaccine.
Washing hands recommended to avoid exposure to the plague.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the restroom or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after emerging their noses, coughs, or grenades.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is killed by the soap of the house, which destroys the protective bubble.
The CDC next recommends the use of an alcohol-based thinking of the hand with at least 60% of alcohol according to the content when soap and water are not available for use.
OTHERS strongly urge many to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (in a minute of exposure to the strokes for the faceless fluctuation), including 62–7% etanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodiium hipoclorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroksidan, and 0.2–7.5% povid-iodin.
Other strings, such as benzalkonium chlorida and chrohexydina gluconat, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case COVID is suspected or verified in such facilities as the office or a local care center, all areas such as offices, waterrooms, general areas, shared electronic equipments such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and ATM machines used by the sick, should be unloaded.
The health organization recommends that people close their mouths and noses with unharmed arms or tissues when they circumference and immediately remove any tissue.
The surgical mask is recommended for those who may be infected, because using the mask can limit the amount and distance of ecosmosis travels that spread while speaking, insins, and coughs.
WHO has issued a time and ways to use a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, the virologist at the University of Leeds, "The mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is the main source of jangkitance without right hand care."
WHO has recommended the use of their healthy masks only if they risk high risks, like those who care about COVID-19, even though they also admit that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of facial masks by communists.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a non - medical mask made of cloths. China specifically recommends the use of the medical mask used to waste by healthy citizens, especially when they are close to (1 meters (3 ft) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends using an operation mask while using public transportation or being in a crowded place.
Thailand’s health officials encouraged the crowds to make laundry masks in their home and washed them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbid going out to public without wearing masks or closing one’s nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnamese urged everyone to wear a face - to - face mask when going to the marketplace to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government decreed that everyone who entered the runcit store must wear a face mask.
Israel had asked the inhabitants to wear a face - to - face mask in public.
Taiwan, who has produced ten million masks every day since the mid-Math, has asked passengers to train and bus between cities to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has forced the mask to wear when it comes out, as well as recommending the home mask maker for those who cannot buy a face mask.
Face masks have also been used widely in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social prisons (called as physical prisons) are accompanied by jangkitial controls that are intended to slow the spread of disease by inquiring a close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel partition; and endings of school, work, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Individuals can perform social prisons permanently at home, limit travel, avoid panic accommodations, use hacaˈs of touch, and tackle themselves physically from others.
Many governments are now undertaking or recommending social prisons in the aftermath of the epidemic.
The size of the maximum assembly recommended by the U.S. government body and health organizations is quickly reduced from 250 people (if there are no known COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germans prohibited public meetings by more than two people, older adults and they were with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune systems to respond to increased risks for serious diseases and complications and served by the CDC to stay in the home as much as possible with a community plague.
The use of the term "sociative imprisonment" has led to the immutable that people have to experience social isolation completely, instead of encouraging them to contact others in an alternative way. Some people have issued the sexual health guideline to use during pandemic.
This includes the suggestions for having sex only with someone who lives with you, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
It has been suggested to those who were detected by COVID-19 and those suspected have been infected.
Medical agencies have issued a detailed order for right self-entering, many governments have ordered or suggested an independent quarantine to the entire population living in the area affected.
The strongest quarantine order has been issued to those who belong to a high- risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who had previously wandered into the country or region with widespreadularularularity have been advised to go through an independent quarantine for 14 days from the possibility of the final exposure.
The strategy in control of the plague is to gush or oppress, and deployment.
Contamination is carried on at the initial stage of the plague and is suggesting to track and isolate those infected and introduce the jangkitation and other vacccination steps to stop disease from pending to the population remaining.
When it can no longer be able to block theularity of the disease, then attempts turn to the level of releasing: steps are taken to slow theularization and reduce the effects of the health and society care system.
Step combinations of steps weigh down and lower may be carried out at the same time.
Pressure requires more forceful steps to resign the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of health services to be overloaded and provides more time for vaccine and treatment built.
The pulse is not a pharmaceautical pulse that can take care ofular transmissions, such as personal precaution, the mass, the body masonry, the move of the society that is subjected to physical prisons such as closeing and canceling large assembly; the community's involvement to encourage reception and interference in such interference; so also the environments like the surface. More drast action is being placed to membrankular relocation in China after the outbreak is clear to be taken after the outbreak, the problem is clear, and the city is revolved and the restrictions of the ban.
Other countries also take various steps that are suggested to limit virus infections.
South Korea introduces a huge network and local recognition, and warns about individual movements infected.
Singapore provides financial support for those who are infected and put on high fines to those who failed to do so.
Taiwan raises a face - to - face income and diverting medical supplies. The simulation of Great Britain and the United States shows that reduction (stillation but doesn't stop preaching epidemics) and pressing (stitching the growth of epidemics) has a major challenge.
The basis of optimum reduction may reduce health care requirements that affect 2/3 and half deaths, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to be weighed down.
Pressures can be optional but need to be preserved as long as the virus goes in human population (or until the vaccine exists, if it comes first), because the preaching will immediately reboot when the prevention steps are strengthened.
Pairing long - term hands to press pandemics result in social and economic cost.
No antivirus drugs are specified for COVID-19, but the development effort is under way, including testing existing drugs.
Wishing a semeasure given in the bubble, drinking water and resting will help ease symptoms.
Depending on the acidity, oxygen therapy, intravena liquid and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids may make it worse.
Some of the collections that were previously proposed for treatment of other viruses are on the screen to be used in COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "dramatic and home" can provide relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The enhancement of capacity and health care adjustments for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a basic consequence of the plague.
The ECDC and the WHO Department of Europe has issued a guideline for hospitals and the main health care services to move resources in various stages, including focusing the lab service to the COVID-19 test, canceling electrative procedures when necessary, separating and dissolving positive COVID-19 patients, and increasing the ability to care for individuals by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about the first case place (which is called an empty number patient) comes up.
The first known coronavirus novel can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, coronavirus case numbers in Hubei slowly increase.
This case is mostly associated with the Sea Borong Seafoo, which also sells living animals, and one theory is the virus from one of these types; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30th, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital informed their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, have been warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another one, Ai Fen, has been cursed by the superiors because of this.
Wuhan Dibanding Health Commission and then issue public notice on December 31, and informs WHO.
The unknown lungs have been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to trigger investigation at the beginning of January, at the early stage of the plague, the double rate is less than every seven and a half days.
Early and early in the middle of January 2020, the virus spread into another Chinese area, helped by the New Year’s New China and Wuhan migration into transportation and the main train trade.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The official data later indicated that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms on January 20,20. As of March 26, the United States has overcome China and Italy with the highest possible case rate on April 9,20, over 1,61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 have died and over 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and regions have had at least one case.
As a result of this pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Areas have limited free movement and run border control.
The national reaction has entered such a calibration of quarantine as a command sitting in the house, a command for shelter, or an emergency order. For 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are under an emergency form in the United States, over 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in emergency in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On 26 Mac, 1.7 billion people around the world are in an emergency form, which increases to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first COVID 19 case was verified back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unauthorised report suggests the initial case was on November 17th.
Dr. Zhang Jixiang observed a pneumonia cluster on December 26, then his hospital informed CDC Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
Early genetic test for patient samples on December 27, 2019 shows the presence of coronavirus like SARS.

The lab test of the coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is associated with the method to detect virus presence and methods detecting antibodi which are produced as a response to infections.
The presence of the virus in the sample is verified by RT-PCR, which tracks the coronavirus RNA.
This test is special and designed only to track the RNA-CoV-CARS virus.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibodi detection can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibodi tests indicate the number of patients who have suffered from the disease, including those whose symptoms are too light to report or who have a symptom.
The rate of death due to the proper disease and group immunity rate in the population can be determined from the test results.
Because of a limited test, as long as Mac 2020 no country has the data that can be expected of the virus prevalent in their population.
Until 23 Mac, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there's a lot of varieties in the number of tests that have been done throughout the countries.
This kind of diversity is also likely to affect the rate of the case death that is clearly reported, which may be overreactly summed in some countries.
Using reverse reaction reactions of polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) the test time can be performed in the respiratory sample obtained through various methods, including nasofaringeal and sputum samples.
The decision was usually available within hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test done with the swab of the throat was only trusted in the first week of disease.
Then the virus can be lost in the throat while it keeps double in the lungs.
For those who are tested in the second round, alternate sample materials can then be taken from in the airway of a yag in using the catetering or material cause coughs (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was erected in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the reversing reaction reactions of real polyemerase, and became the base for 250,000 cutes to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also built a test by January 23, 2020. South Korean Kogenebiotech built a SARS-CoV-2-existing kid based on PCR, Kilinic gred (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies who accept an emergency usage from the National Medical Producation for the SARV-CoV2-based SCR. In the United States, the Center for Control and Prevention Control (DCC) has been passed on the RTRRT-CRRRCS.
One of the three genetic tests in old versions of the test exam caused an uncertain result of a broken reagen, and the bottle neck test at CDC at Atlanta; this average makes less than 100 samples a day processed through February 2020;
Tests using two components cannot be trusted until 28 February 2020, and before they are allowed to start the test.
The test has been passed by the Food Administration and Dad's Administration under the Truth of the U.S. commercial lab started the test early of March 2020.
As far as 5 Mac 2020 LabCorp announces the availability of COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics also make COVID-19 tests available throughout the country starting 9 March 2020.
No quantity limit was announced; grouping specimens and processing must be run by CDC needs.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were built and produced by the Virology Research Center and VECTOR State Bioteknology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Survival in Health. On 12 March 2020, Klinik Mayo reported has awakened a test to detect the COVID-19 infection.
On 19th of March 2020, the FDA issued the truth of the use of emergency (EA) to Abbott Laboratories for tests on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA before that has issued similar truths to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21th March 2020, the same Cepheid also received EU from the FDA for a revolving test about 45 minutes.
The FDA has released a test using isotermal acid enforcement technology instead of PCR.
Since this test doesn't require a series of temperature cycles that change in this method can give positive results in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At this time there were about 18.000 of these machines in the A.S. and Abbott expected to speed up the output to send 50,000 tests a day. The test using monobodi monoklons that specifically bind to the nucleapsid proteon (N protein) coronavirus novels are being built in Taiwan, with the hope that the test can make decisions in 15 to 20 minutes the same test as the fast influenza test.
On Mac 2020 a written review concluded that "the chestdiographer has a small diagnostic value at the top, while the CT [commputered autograph] discovery may have been present even before the simptom starts.
The CT typical feature includes the opacity of multilocal glass bars with solid, asimetric, and posterior dish.
Subpleture domination, opening and obsessing are formed when disease evolves.
A study that compares the PCR to the CT at Wuhan at the point of pandemic in the moment suggested that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, even though less special, with a lot of the properties of the claiming to act with pneumonia and other diseases.
As far as March 2020, the American Radical Kolej recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as the first line test to diagnostic COVID-19".
Part of the immun response to infection is an antibodi income including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals starting seven days or next after simptoms are started, to determine paranoia, and in population surveillance. A evaluate can be done at the center lab (CLT) or through a point-of-care test (PoCT).
The automatic high cellusing system in many clinical labs will be able to run this evaluation but the availability will depend on the income rate for each system.
For CLT's single specimen of periferial blood is used, even though serial specimens can be used to follow immun responses.
For PoCT single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a fist on the skin.
Not like the service PCR method isn't required before the evaluation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that give prompts to agencies as necessary and so can now pass their antibodies test.
As far as 7 April 2020, only a test has been passed by the FDA under the permission of the emergency usage. It was at the end of March 2020, the Medical Laboratory Euroimmun Medical Laboratory diagnoses and Epitope diagnosed the European graduation for their test kit, which could detect the antibodi IgG and IgA against the virus in the blood sample.
The test capacity is a few hundred samples in a few hours and so is much faster at the conventional PCR judgment for the virus RNA.
An antibodi can usually be detected 14 days after the infection started. In the early April, UK found no antibodi test kit that was bought pretty well to use.
Hong Kong has provided a schema watching the patients who are suspected can stay at home, "the emergency rate will give the patient specimen tube", they're venting into the tube, sending back and getting the test results soon. The NHS of British has declared that it was being a pioneer to test a schema for a suspected case in the house, which would move out the risk of patients if they went to hospital or had to quit an ambulance if they had to be used. In the test for the COVID to be treated for the COV-19s, a medical care of taking appropriate steps.
In Germany, the Statutori Medical Insurance Center has helped South Korea to do some of the most severe test of the country, and in Germany, the Statutorial Health Insurance Association said on 2 Mac, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests a day in the abulatory and 10,700 have been tested in the previous week.
Dancing is often handled by a health issue when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a whole capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
As far as 19 Mac's test has been offered in a few big cities.
For 26th March 2020 the number of tests done in Germany is unknown, for only positive results are reported.
The first survey of the lab revealed up to the 12/2020 calendar week as at least 483, 295 samples were tested including 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, testers at Technion and Rambam Hospital and test the method of testing samples of more than 64 patients sim, by collecting samples and testing only further if the samples are available are positive available. The carets are provided for a 2000 accommodated emergency rates called "Ho-Yu" or "Mata" in the Chinese language has been opened by more than 520 BI, a day.
With a construction monitored by the Wan Jian BGI founder and the five days, the model has shown the case in Hubei will be 47% higher and costs matching to control quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach targets.
Wuhan's lab has immediately been traced by Hou Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a number of 12 cities throughout China.
So 4 Mac 2020 the whole daily number is 50,000 tests a day. The open source, the multix forms of the Origami Assays have been issued that can test as many as 1122 patients for COVID19 using only 93 evaluations. This balanced shape can be run in small labs without needing robotic caire control.
Until Mac, the lack and the inadequacy of the reagenency has made the big exams in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore sample supplies that involve warming samples in 98 C (2018 F) for 5 minutes to remove RNA genomes for the next test. On the 31th of March it has been declared that the United Arab Emerity is testing more subjects for every head of the Coronavirrus than any other country, and it is on the right path to increase the scale of the test level for a large number of populations.
It's through the combination of past pandu capabilities, and the purchase of large-time population labs of processing from groups of 42 and BGI (based to the "Hou-Yan" emergency detecting lab in China)
Builded in 14 days, this lab is capable of running thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world on this scale to be controlled outside China.
Different test spells of different parts of the genetic profile have been built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization accepts a German method for a cute income sent to a low-efficiency country without a source to wake its own kits.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol built by the United States Center of Disease Control is not available until January 28, slowing the test in the U.S. China and the United States have a problem with the later test reliability, and this country and Australia are unable to supply sufficient demands and suggestions for tests by the experts of health.
On the other hand, experts tell South Korea’s vast readiness to make tests helped reduce the spread of coronavirus novels.
Test capacity, most of which is in private sector lab, built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 Mac, the World Health Organization called to improve the test program as the best way to slow down the speed of COVID-19 pandemic pandemics.
In March 2020 China reported problems with precision on their test kit.
In the United States, the test kit built by the CDC had the "weakness;" the government then issued the bureaucracy partition that had prevented a private test. The Spanish country bought a test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the decision was not correct.
The Pharaoh explained that the wrong decision could be due to the failure of collecting samples or using a proper kit.
The Spanish Ministry said it would retrieve the kit that restored the wrong decision, and will replace it with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kit that the Chech Republic bought of China gave the wrong decision.
The Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this kit be removed to Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry tell the Turkish test kit bought from China has a "high error" and not "using it". UK buys 3,5 million cutes tests from China but at the beginning of April 2020 announces this test cannot be used.
The test, followed by their positive quarantine and detecting those who were connected with positive SARS-CoV-2 in individuals, giving positive results.
Investigators working in the city of Vo in Italy, the first COVID-19 death site in Italy, run two rounds of tests on the entire population of almost 3,400 people, about ten days.
Nearly half the positive individuals are tested have no symptoms, and all the cases found have been quarantined.
With travel partitions, it has eliminated a whole new infection.
With an aggressive contact detection, travel partition, the test, and quarantine, the coronavirrus pandemic 2020 in Singapore has moved slower than the other country built, but without a firm partition like the closets of restaurants and runcit shops.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore has begun to advise its people to sit at home on March 28, but school will be reopened on the day after March 23.
Some other countries have also controlled decimals by detecting aggressive contacts, incoming partitions, tests and quarantines, but with less aggressive emergency commands, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study of statistics found that a country that made more tests, relative to the number of deaths, has a low death rate, perhaps because these countries can detect those who only have light symptoms or no directly better.
WHO suggested that countries who don't have a test and national lab capacity with limited experience about COVID-19 send five positive samples and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO lab references for a verification test.
From 16 lab references, 7 is found in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positif column as % test" is held by the state test base.
The country that only tests individuals entered to the hospital will get positive values higher as % test than the country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest are the same.
Smoothing (or washing of hands) is the act of cleaning one's hands to remove dust, fat, microorganism, or other unwanted material.
Smoking hands with solid soaps consistently at certain "critical" in the day prevents the infectation of many diseases, such as the dent and the mosquito, which spread through an unclean path to the mouth.
Individuals may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or ordinary flues, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths (e. g. mutant).
Five critical times in the day that witness to washing your hands with soap are important: before and after throwing a large water, after cleaning the child's back or turning the lamp, before feeding children, before eating and before and before and after providing food or taking over raw meat, fish or birds.
If there is no water or soap, one can wash the hands with ashes, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
First, time, and after preparing something for the meal.
Before and after controlling the sick.
After turning a lampin or cleaning the children who have used the toilet.
Later, we had to cut off the nose and froze.
After touching animals or animals ’ food or animal waste.
Medical hygiene is the practice of hygiene that involves medical procedures.

That is particularly important for those who control food and medical work, but it is also a major practice in general.
Smoothing hands have many health benefits, including reducing the spread of the flu, the crownvirus, and other infected diseases; preventing the roots of curtains; reducing respiratory infections;
And lower the rate of the baby's death when it's born at home.
The study in 2013 showed the practice of washing good hands will lead to a small increase in the high growth of children under five years of age.
In the building country, the rate of death in childhood associated with respiratory disease and birit properties can be reduced by introducing simple behavior, for example, washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate of this disease to nearly 50%.
The intervence that encourages the washing of hands can reduce the episod of the sheept mark as much as one third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in the low-estimation area.
48% of the mixing of the birit properties can be associated with washing hands with soaps. Smokeing with soaps is the only effective and expensive way to avoid the calibration and infections of the respiratory acids (day), as automatic behavior done at home, schools and society worldwide.
Pneumonia, the main day, is the cause of death number one among children under the age of five, sacrificeing lives about 1,8 million children a year.
The property of birit and pneumonia together causes nearly 3,5 million children's death every year.
According to UNICEF, planting the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or a mechanism, reducing death from the diarrhea almost half and death because of the acid infections of nearly one quarter.
Smoothing is usually merged with other sanitation intervention as part of water, sanitation, and hypothesis.
Driving their hands can also protect them from the impetigos that are transferred through regular physical contact.
A damaging small effect when washing your hands is too often is that washing too hard hands can lead to the damage that skin has been caused by the drying on the skin.
A study from Denmark in 2012 found that overcrowded hands could lead to the gatal-gatal, the side-shaped skin, known as the ekzema of hand or the dermatis, which used to be among health care workers.
Too often washing hands is also seen as one of the obsessive obsessive disorders (OCD).
There are five critical days all day that washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transfer of unclean plague to the mouth: after using the toilet (discretion, the brush), after cleaning the child's back, before feeding the children, before eating and before/sebe giving food or controlling the raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when the proper way to wash your hands must be practiced to avoid infections include before and after treating torn or wound; after rubbishing, coughing, or rubbishing their noses; after touching animal shit or controlling; and after holding the trash.
Rate washing hands using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a study of washing hands in 54 countries found that average 38.7% of the house has a way of washing hands with soap. In 2014, studies show Saudi Arabs have the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States is nearly in the middle of 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Some behavioral metodologies now exist to increase the washing of hands with soaps at times critically critical.
An important Health Care Program that is carried out by the Educational Department in the Philippines is an example of a large period of action in regard to health and child education.
Spreading twice a year, plus by washing hands every day with soap, and rubbing teeth every day with florida. It is the core of this national program.
It's been executed in Indonesia.
Impressions of microorganisms from skin become more useful by adding soap or detergenerate into the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce obstacles in the solution, and increase the constantity.
It's just that water is not a sketch cleaner because of the fat and protein, which is a organic component of soil, not late in water.
However, waterwater is a normal part of cleaning.
Because of its reusable nature, soft soap may store the bacteria obtained from the previous usage.
A few little studies about the bacteria transfer from the dirted soap found transfer is impossible because bacteria are removed when they are washed with buses.
The CDC site is still saying "screaming liquids that are released without using their hands are better. "
An anti -bakery plays a huge promotions for people in general who care about health concerns.
There is no evidence so far that using antiseptics or symptoms recommended selecting antibiotic survival organisms.
However, antibaktereria soaps contain ordinary antibakeria agents such as a trick, which has a list of widespread endurance against organisms.
So even though the strain of antibodies is not selected by antibakeria soaps, it may not work so well as it is used to be.
In addition to the skin protectors and agents, this advanced form of formation may contain asid (asetic, asetic acid, askorbic acid, hydic acid) as a pH programmer, assumption of active acids and scumptions (alsolu vera, vitamins, bulbs, and plants extract). An applisis complication of the Physics of the University of Oregon indicate that the soaphyuses have the same effect as an antibakterical acid that the users of tricloses contains in the triclosures of diseases and remove bacteriaes from the hand.
The water is not too hot to wash hands not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria regenerates at the temperature (37 °C) of the body.
Pregnancy water, however, works more than cold water to remove natural oil, which has land and bacteria.
Unlike many people who believe, scientific studies indicate that using moam water has no effect on lowering the microb content of the hand.
Hand cleaner or hand antiseptic is a hand membership agent that is not water based on water.
In the late 1990s and in the early part of the 21st century, the alcohol of a hand cleaning agent was not based on water (also known as a water joy based on alcohol, greasing antiseptic hands, or plumbing) became popular.
Most is based on isopropil or etanol that isformed with abalan agent such as Karbomer (acrilic acid acid policy) into the gel, or humid like glycerin into a liquid, or busa for use and to reduce the effects of alcohol drying.
By adding melting hydrogen oxide activity will increase the antimicroba activity. The curtain that contains the minimum of 60 to 95% of alcohol is a checkout bug remover.
The joy of alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria sustaining drugs, tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and hepatitis.
Alcohol cleaner that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99.9% (35 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria at the hand of 30 seconds after use and 99.99% (universal 4 to 5 logs) bacteria on hand one minute after use. Hand cleaner is most effective on bacteria and less affects some viruses.
Alcohol cleaner based on alcohol almost doesn't work on the virus of norovirus type (or Norwalk), which causes the most infective gastrorentrytics. Antiseptic hands or voice of alcohol which is sufficient to be used to defuse or protect both hands correctly.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all the fingers were rubbed for about 30 seconds until liquid, basins or gels are dry.
The end of the finger must also be washed well, by rubbing it in both hands, the Centers and Prevention of A.S. diseases recommends washing hands rather than emitting the cleaner, especially when the hands look dirty.
The use of these agents has increased because of its easy use and quick homicide activity on microorganisms, however, it can't replace the right hand washing unless there's no soap and water.
The use of hand cleaner based on alcohol can often cause dry skin unless emoliens and/or skin slides are added to formulas.
Sing alcohol effect can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emoliens to formulas.
In the clinical test, the hypothesis of the alcohol that contains the emoliene caused the embroidering of the skin with soap or antimicroba detergenerate.
Disaster contacts, contact uretic syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol abdomen or extra materials in the joy of alcohol hand is rare.
The tendency to lower contact pythons to be attractive rather than to use soap and water to wash hands.
Agents aren't water, despite effective, don't clean the hands of organic materials, it's just exterminating germs.
Because it's not as good as soap and water to prevent the spread of patogen, because the pathogen is still in hand.
The detection of alcohol - free hand is high depending on its ingredients and its formulas, and in history it has been less successful than alcohol and alcohol drink.
Recently, the formulation that uses the benzalkonium klorida has proved to have ongoing antimicroba activity and cumulative after use, not like alcohol that has proved to be less effective detection after many times, is likely due to the negative reactions on the skin progressively.
Most people feel that they cannot have soap; rather, they use ashes or soil.
Abu or land may be more effective than using just water but may be less effective than soap.
Anxiety could exist if soil or ashes were contaminated with microorganisms that might increase the infectivity of disease.
Abu is also a bug agent like soap because it forms an alkali solution if it has contact with water.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap if soap cannot be found.
The U.S. Disease Control Center suggests the technique to wash the right hands to prevent the infectation of a disease including the following steps:
It's wet hands with soap or cold water.
It is recommended that water flows because it may have been contaminated at the same time, at the same time, it does not seem to affect the temperature.
Blow his hands with soap, including the back of his hands, between his fingers and under my nails.
Saabun removes skin, and research shows that people tend to wash more carefully when using soap than with water.
Sental for at least 20 seconds.
Stimulating the processes, which help remove the germs from the skin, and gravitating them with longer discarding more germs.
When well with flowing water.
Raising in the basin can reorder your hands.
Snap with clean towels or let them dry by air.
The wet and moist hands are easier to get dirty again, the thumb, the wrists, the part between the finger and the bottom of the fingerprints are a part that's always out of sight.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and nail painted.
Slapping losses are usually recommended to avoid hands from dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transfer.
There are several cheap options to make it easier to wash your hands if there's no pipe and/or soap, e.g. menuting water from gantung or pumps with appropriate holes and/or using ashes if necessary in the building country. If limited water supply (as in school or outside the building area), there is a solution that saves water like "pippipipi" and other cheap options.
The tippi pipe is easy technology using a jag hanging with rope, and the towels controlled by the feet to pour some water on the hands and soap.
The important part in the cleaning process is the effective hand filtering, but it is debated about the form of the most effective filtering in the public bathroom.
More and more studies show that paper towels are far cleaner than those who use electricity in most of the bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was made by the University of Westminster, London, and enforced by the paper towel industry, the European Tisu Symposium, to adjust the level of hygiene when using paper towels, warm air sweaters, and modern jet air sweaters.
After washing and seizing hands with warm air dryers, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the finger end is found averagely increasing by 194% and at the base of the hand 254%.
Driving with jet air dryers has caused the amount of bacteria to increase at the bottom of the fingertips averagely 42% and at the base of the hands of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the end is average reduced to 76% and on the hands site up to 77%.
The airflower, which's pulling out of the unit at the rate of 180 m/s (650 km/holm; 400 bsj), could drag out microorganisma from the hand and the units and potentially polluting other waterroom users and the environment of the water room for 2 meters.
The use of the warm airbrushing spreads microorganisma up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study made by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated a different handwriting method.
The following changes are found in bacteria count after handring:
There are many different sweaters, and the sweater is compared to paper towels for drying.
Washing hands using handwashing tissue is an alternative option while traveling when there's no soap and water.
Alcohol cleaner needs to contain at least 60% alcohol.
Stealing for medical treatment has long been a duty when Ignaz Semmelweis doctor from Hungary found his detection (in 1846) in avoiding hospital illness.
There are electronic devices that warn the hospital staff to wash hands when they forget.
A study found that the use could lower infection rates.
Washing hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using a lot of soap and water or gel to rinse and rub each side of the hand.
Hands need to be rubbed together with the finger that enters in silly.
If there's any dirt under the nails, a hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since gear may remain in the water at our hands, we need to dye it properly and wipe it so dry with clean towels.
After emptinessing, the paper towel had to be used to close the water (and open the door when necessary).
This thing avoids getting hands dirty again when it touches the surface.
Washing hands in the health care environment is designed to remove microorganisms of patogen ("man") and avoid spreading them.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that a less permanent washing of hands is at an unacceptable stage in most medical environment, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching a patient, next spread microorganism.
One study indicates that proper washing and other simple procedures have a limited amount of cateter - perceptions. The Worldwide Health Organization publishes a standard in which to wash and watch hands in medical care factories.
Guides on how to describe the hands of this organization can be found on its web site to make comments to many people.
Relevant research has been done by Whitby et al.
The commercial device can measure and confirm hand hygiene, if the selia landing demonstration is required.
Worldwide Health Organization has "Lima Momen" to wash hands:
after exposed to body blood/screen
Before the accepted duty, and
After treating patients. Supplement of antiseptic chemicals on soaps or "antimicrobial" gave a murder action to an agent washing hands.
Such homicide may be wanted before surgery or in a state where an antibiotic resistant organism is widespread. To 'spent' someone's hands for surgery, there will have to be a pipe that can be turned on and shut down without touching with hands, some chlorhksidina or iodin, a sterile towel to block the hands after the laundry, and a sterile sykat for rubbrushing and other sterile to clean under the finger.
All the jewelry needs to be unloaded.
This procedure needs to wash the hands and the lower arm up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Ten minutes long massage time is not required.
When pouring, under the arm the water must be removed from flowing back to the hand.
After the laundry was completed, his hands were wrapped in sterile cloths and an operation was used.
We might slow down the use of the gear, using antiseptics before and after treating the sick better, as well as helping to wash hands.
For controlling the infection of the clerical staff in the hospital, it's found the biggest benefit of the washing of the hand comes from the first 20%, and very few benefits are gained when the exposure frequency increases over 35%.
Washing with the usual soap results more than three times infectious diseases that were transferred to food instead of washing with antibakeria soaps.
But the soap and water are more effective than the alcohol-based fluenza to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the spectrum of Klostridium from the hand. The media to improve the cleanliness in the health environment can include education for the staff about the washing of hand, improve the readiness of alcohol, and a written reminder and verbally to the staff.
There was a need for more research on which intervention was most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as an effective and essential tool for good health, even well - fed.
In any event, the lack of water supplies that can be expected, soap or the facility washing hands in the house, at school, and at work made it a challenge to reach a global washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, private and public toilets wash very close to every private toilet is rare, even though there are cheap options available to build a washing station.
However, the low - washing rate is also possible because of a pattern taken from a lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocating to wash hands with soap can affect basic results, increased awareness of the benefits of washing hands and leads to long - term population behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
Systemtic checks for 70 studies found the approach based on Communiti is effective to increase the secrecy in LMIC, while social processing campaigns are less effective. One example of the procession of washing hands at school is "Three Star Traveling" by UNICEE that takes the school to make sure the students wash their hands with soaps, between other conditions of cleanliness.
When minimum standards are reached, school can move from one to at last three stars,
Building a wash station may be part of the promotion campaign washing hands that are done to reduce the disease and death of a child.
The Day of Kicking the World Hands is another example of a campaign that is trying to improve behavior, as a result of a 20-20 coronary epidemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of the emoji washing hands.
Some studies have considered the cost of completely washing hands in the construction country related to DALY.
However, one survey suggests that it promotes the washing of hands with soaps much more cost than any other water interference and sanitation.
In the middle of the 19th century, two hygiene pioneers were first recognized by the hands of Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the English "defense of Modern nursing."
At that time, most people still believe that infection is caused by a rotten smell called a miasmas.
In the 1980s, food and infections associated with health care caused the U.S. Centers and Prevention of Disease to be more active in promoting the hygiene of the hands as a vital way to prevent infection spread.
The pig flues in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic pandemic in 2020 led to a increase of awareness about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, poster with the "kick wash the right hand" was hung next to the sink washing hands in the public bathroom and in the office building and the airport in Germany.
The phrase "saves a person's hand from something" means announce a person's will to take responsibility for it or share the involvement in it.
It came from Matthew’s Bible texts when Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to join Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase by the use of more widely used in some English community.
In Macbeth by Shakespreare, Lady Macbeth began compulsively washing his hands in the trial to wash the imaginable stain, representing his guilt of his crimes he did and what he influenced for his husband to do.
It is observed that people, once remembering or reflecting on unethical practices, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they appreciate more the washing of hands.
Besides, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to be involved in other payments, such as volunteer work.
Religion establishes the washing of hands for cleanliness and symbolic purposes, washing their hands in symbolically, using water without soap to wash, is part of the ritual of washing hands within many religions including the beliefs of the Bahai, the Hindus, the pharmacy, the pharmacy of the Jewish religion, the Lavabo in Christianity and the Wudhu in Islam.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims are obliged to wash their hands after using toilets.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims also have to wash their hands before and after meals.
Work control dangers against COVID-19
The danger of the work control for COVID-19 is an application for health metodology and job security for a danger control to coronavirus prevention 2019 (COVID-19).
Right danger control at work depends on work and work jobs, based on risk evaluation of the exposure source, disease disorder in community, and risk factors for each employee who may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Security Administration and Health Department (OSHA), the job with the risk of undertaking has minimal contact with the civilians and other colleagues, where basic jangkitization steps are suggested to include washing hands, encourage workers to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics, and maintain regular cleanliness and exaggeration at work.
The job with the risk of simple exposure includes a job that requires regular contact or close contact with an unknown or suspected one has COVID-19, but it may be infected because of exposure in the actual community or international travel.
These include employees who have contact with public people like school, working environments with high population density, and some environments with high volumes.
The danger control for this group, besides the basic infection prevention steps include landing using air filters with high efficiency, sneezing, and having self-protected equipment if they were connected with those COVID-19 infected.
OSHA assumes health care workers and bodies exposed to the known or suspected COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to the high risk of persuasion if the employee performs aerosol income procedures on, or collects or controls specimen from the known or suspected COVID-19.
The security control that is appropriate for these employees includes engineering controls such as landing rooms with negative pressure and self-protective equipment that suits the job.
COVID-19 puzzles can have some effects on the job.
Employees may not attend for work because they are sick, have to take care of others, and fear strangers.
Traffic patterns may change, either in the area of the requested goods, and how to get these items (like shopping at the top time or through delivery service or the past drive service).
Finally, delivery from the affected geographical area could be interrupted by COVID-19.
Plans deal with risk levels associated with various jobs and jobs, including dropouts, risk factors that arise from home environments and community conditions, and risk factors for each employee as old age or chronic medical condition.
It also emphasizes control to overcome the risks, and a contingensency plan for situations that may result from the plague.
At ease and infectious reactions of disease may be subjected to national launch synor or subnational.
Objective to the response to the plague includes reducingularity within the staff, protecting people who are at high risk for bad health complications, maintain business operations, and recommending bad effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The disease disorder in the community is where the business affects the response.
The risk control hierarchy is the frame used extensively in security and employment health to barter the danger controls by detection.
When the COVID-19 dangers cannot be removed, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the last is self-protective equipment.
The engineering control involves an exhaustion of the workers from the dangers of work and not depending on employees, and it can be the most effective solution to run.
Administration control is a change in a work base or procedure that requires the action of a employee or employer.
Self - protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administration control but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on dangers to employees, properly installed by adaptation (cth respirator), used consistentlyly, always checked and replaced, if necessary, and correctly removed, cleared and removed or removed to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. and Health Administration, the job of lower exposure risks has minimal contact with the public and other colleagues.
The basic prevention of jangkitations that are recommended for all jobs includes regularly and thoroughly washing hands, encouraging the workers to sit in the house if they are sick, respiratory ethics include shutting down when knobs and waists, providing boots and containers, preparing for work telework or shifts if necessary, not encouraging workers to use other people's tools or equipment, and keeping regular members and stating collabs at work.
Pronunciation and identification of potentially infected individuals is critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others at work.
The Centre Control and Prevention of A.S. Disease. (CDC) recommends that employees who have a ventilation symptoms sit in the house so that they are free from fever, fever or symptoms, at least 24 hours without using other fever or medications to reduce other symptoms, and the base of flexible illnesses, allow workers to sit in the house to care for the sick family, and to know about this base.
According to OSHA, the job of risking simple exposure includes a job that needs regular contact or close contact in six feet (1.8 m) from the unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but it may be infected with SARS-CoV2 because the communience that is happening around the business location, or because that person recently made an international trip to the location with the extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This includes employees who have contacts with civilians such as at school, working environments with high populations and some high volume environments. The engineering for this group and the increased riskier groups include installing air filters with high grades, increasing the rates, installing physical barriers such as physics and installing patrons and packing windows for customers. The administration of this group and the risking group includes encouraging workers to sit in the house, substituting for communications, creating a potentially intercess, preventing the travels with the outbreaks of COVID, building communications, which include the current pacembling risks, training and training employing patrons and patrons of patrons and coopers, which are necessary to installing the work force and to supporters, and limiting the security at the very large-s of the authorities.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respiratory use.
If a person falls sick in the plane, the proper control to protect the workers and other passengers includes withdrawing the sick from another person at six feet, assigning a crew to guard the sick, and giving a face to the sick, or asking the sick to close the mouth and nose with a hail when it or sinks.
The cabin crew needs to wear medical gloves once in caring for a sick traveler or touching potentially contaminated fluid or surface, and perhaps extra self-protective equipment if the sick traveler has a fever, an ongoing cough or breathing difficulty.
The gloves and items of other waste need to be cleared in the biohavior bag, and the surface is contaminated, and the surface must be cleaned up and uncovered after that.
In any case, medical followups need to be made in the cabins that were isolated. For school and child care facility, the CDC recommends short-terming covers to clean or extermination if the infected people have been in the school building without counting the community's spread.
When there's a minimum Communityular to simple, social strategies can take over such as canceling field trips, assembly and other big meetings such as physical education, collar classes or dining at the cafeteria, adding room between tables, coming and backs that were busy, restricting visitors not important, and using a separate health location for children with simptoms like cema.
When there is a high infection in local community, instead of socially distance strategies, the school stoping continues can be considered. CDC considers the risk of a obsolete health risk for the power member who performs routine activities are low.
The law enforcement officer who must do contact with a valid or suspected individual has COVID-19 recommended to follow the same line of guidance as the emergency medical technicians including the right self-protective equipment.
If a close contact occurs during the arrest, the employees need to sort their belts and task equipment before using back with a sleeve or a house cleaner, and follow the standard operation for repairing and smugglinging of PPE used and to slash and washing clothes.
OSHAA considers health caregivers and morgues to be high categories or to be high - rated risks for seductions.
Exposure jobs include medical treatment, support, labs, and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It's a very high risk of exposure if employees do aerosol income procedure on, or collect or control specimens from the known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol income procedure includes intubation, cough parental procedure, broncocopi, some gogian procedures, or invasive specimen collection.
The homework of the high risk of exposure includes the employee involved in providing the known or suspected body of the COVID-19 case in their death; it was a very high risk of admission if they were autopsychiatry. Additional engineering control of this risk group includes aductioning room for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol income procedure is performed.
Surrounding with particularly negative pressure may be appropriate in some areas of caregiver living or body care.
The specimen needs to be handled with the alertness of 3 Frequency.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are going to be isolated to different waiting places depending on whether they are the case COVID-19 suspected. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory for those who work within 6 feet of known patients, or suspected, infected SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol income procedure.
In the United States, the N95 filter-face respiratory which is passed on or better must be used in the context of a thorough and written respiratory program, including the fit, training and medical exams.
The other type of respiratory can provide higher protection and improve the workers' comforts.
WHO recommends only surgery masks for the incoming checkout.
For those who collect breathing specimens from, care, or transport patients COVID-19 without aerosol income procedures, WHO recommends surgery masks, eye protector, or face shields, armor and handbeats.
If aerosol income procedure is done, the operation mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2 respiratory.
Since the global PPE supplies are not enough, WHO recommends that the PPE needs are recorded through the teleperation, physical barriers such as windows are clear, by allowing those who are directly involved in nursing to enter COVID-19 patients's room, using only PPE that is required for specific tasks, to continue the same respiratory use without unmoving when caring for many patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and installing the PPE supply chain, and not encouraging the use of the masks for individuals.

SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Lower the load and prepare for the future
TARIKH/SA HANTAR: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
PALESTION: CC0: No rights preserved
We found ourselves in an amazing state this month.
The19 COVID Epidemic is something that makes our connections in the world and the responsibility we have for each other becomes clear.
We don't have a challenge like this before, but we know that our best responses depend on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community construction that are in the middle of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all our fellow workers through e-mails, phones and bubbles are extraordinary confirmation for extraordinary human beings we're quite lucky enough to work together.
I'm very grateful and proud to be your colleagues all.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how much this world means now when it can refer to Wikipedia, and how much it becomes a powerful symbol because this critical source remains online and is available to all.
Your job makes all of this possible, either you make sure that your workmates get paid or our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, more now.
It's a moment that is not just what we do but the way we do it, it'll give meaning to the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we'll make some significant adjustments on how we work together, starting next week.
Configuration to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, c teams met last night to discuss our approach and our schedule for the day and the moon will come.
In that discussion, we considered what we considered to be a response in keeping with our encounter and the best way of making sure that this organization survives today.
Together, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to slow down a little, it's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our schedule for daily work is approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until it is announced.
We didn't announce leave-- if you could work at normal time, missions can use you.
However, the world is beyond any prediction, whether you are caring for a loved one, buying kitchen items, or going to a doctor, your best interests are yours.
We won't record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not be told, but we told him.
It doesn't require a sick day or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team reconselement the calendar and schedule to ensure the main work area is covered.
(If you were diagnosed positive COVID-19, inform Bryan in T
Those paid by hours will be paid in full.
We've already told and confirmed our commitment to honor our contractor's contractor commitment and our workingmates paid by hours.
Each one will be paid according to their normal hours of work in normal circumstances.
It's including if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use secular work as a way of dispensing stress to their neighbors.
What we do can be so satisfying us, especially in these times.
Again, this is about your self - care.
We're just asking you to communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can adapt it accordingly.
Some jobs are important.
There are things we need to keep going.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Amants and Security, and Dana collections do critical work that may need extra help.
We'll start a process with all the departments to evaluate the current objective and move our focus to support what is important to our mission.
There's a lot to be done for all of us, we'll just focus on the most important project.
slowing down now won't be bad then.
We didn't plan to move "two times to pursue what was left behind" as soon as this pandemic passed away.
You are not expecting to work more time to meet the current unrealistic end date.
We admitted that things had changed and would work hard to set up new targets and new lines if necessary.
What happened to APP ( Annual Plans)?
To adjust to real reality and the expectations of our daily working hours, we would like to adjust our 2020-2021 birthday presentation line.
Our desire to recommend further 2019-2020 plans that allow more time for shopping to allow workers to give priority to critical work, self - care and their dear care while helping those who need or want to work with less work periods for the next few weeks.
Time - line extensions often reduce the burden of work and pressure of current plans around the organization.
We'll introduce our suggestions to the Society in the next week and will inform the representatives and troops of the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team on your capabilities in this.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues might be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In any case, as a step of caution, we have hired an antivirus cleanup team to cut off all the surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They're using the hospital gred antivirus solution to cut off every surface and lobi and elevator system that reaches our level.
This building accepts a custom care protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We felt at ease in the office when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all the psychiatrists in DC.
As long as last week, our DC office switched to a remote supply completely aligned with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some colleagues know about a county in NYC, we also talked about one location in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues, and it may be postponed.
Some of our fellow workers were working hundreds of miles for the first time.
Workmates for a long time knew that it could be an adjustment and want to give you some advice:
Limit the meeting period for the older one or two hours.
If the session is required longer, consider how to divide for a few days.
Consider the agenda and send literature ahead of time.
Make a default video, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier for collaboration and direct connections.
Have a leader to control every meeting, someone to monitor the bual for questions and tracking the list of speakers, and someone helps to take notes (or do collaborative notes).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable head font.
Use the replacement payment for your well-being food.
Join the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution job
The HR Operation team is looking at an ergonomic webinar guide to support increased tasks all over the Foundation.
Since a few weeks ago, we have asked all the community geographic recipients to undo the public program that Wikimedia financed, such as editaton until WHO announced the pandemic ending.
We told them that we understood our request for the cancellation and other partitions could be something impossible to prepare their approved gear activities and nothing would be taken for the inconvenience or change the goal.
In the next week we'll follow up with an additional guide on Wikimania and the state community trial and other themetics.
General sentiments from all the global community seem to be the grief of the disorder but feel relieved of the clarity and the ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Go ahead, CRT is trying to wake up a page about Meta-Wiki to provide room for the community to monitor the impak and follow our communications with them.
Keep related to COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for Khamis to come, at 1400 UTC/07:00 for special personnel meetings.
We'll use this time to share more updates now, answer your questions and take a little time to talk to each other.
We're together in this matter and are here to help as far as we can.
At this time, you can continue looking for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19 related information to the Wiki Office.
CRT will make sure all these pages are updated and all the information is in one place.
We also tried to keep regular communication with the staff that was in a very impressed country at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main flow of work, or a bouquet challenge, or any help you need, don't hesitate to check and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become connectors if necessary.
If you have a hard or sensitive thing, please e-mail to Bryan Judan - Global Operation Director HR.
None of this change should be seen as our service and responsibility.
But all of this is a recognition at this time, our work and responsibility may have to be adjusted in a way that's not like the past.
These are the steps we believe we need to support each other so that we can keep working, provide our movement with the support they need, and the service of the world they can expect.
We will be on our most distant assignment, waiting for us when the day will come.
For now, it's time to support each other and create room for important tasks will come in weeks and possible months to come.
We need you all to make it real, and we need you all to take care of yourself and the family so that you'll be ready at the best stage when the need arrives.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotension change engine 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme connected to the outer surface of cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and usage.
ACE2 encountered angiotensin (ACE) enzyme activity associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the Ang(1-7) makes it a necessary medicine to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also act as the center of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
Human version for enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 enzyme is zink that contains metaloenzim located on the endotelium surface and other cells.
Protein ACE2 contains M2 peptidase N-terminal domain and amino renal collectionrin.
ACE2 is a protein membrane of one-one path, with its enzyme domain active is exposed to the surface of the cell in the lungs and other tissues.
Domain outside the ACE2 cell sticks from the transbreed domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the result of the protein is released into the blood flow and is finally disabled into urin.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 twins on the membrane of the most of the alveolus cells of the II lungs, intract small ususes, arteries and endothelium cells and arterial muscle cells in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypotalamus and brain bars.
The main ACE2 function is to act as a expander to ACE.
ACE attached a hormone I angiotension into angiotensial cup of angiotensi II.
ACE2 sticks the amid acid fenilalanina amino carboksl-terminal of angiotensi II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydropowers into angiotension bowler (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-HH).
ACE2 can also stick a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradikin, apelin, neurotension, dinorfin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane of amino neutral SLC6A19 and is shown in Hartnup disease.
As a transmemant protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry in the cell for some coronaries including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (CARS-SARS cause SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (COV-19 cause virus).
Particularly, the binding of S1 pack proteins for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the encoded domain on the ACE2 above the cell surface resulted in endositosis and the virus translocation and enzyme into the endosom located between cells.
The entry process also requires a supply of protein S by the TMPRSS2 certification of the TMPRS2 hosts, pension under the current research as a potential terapeutic. This has caused some hypothesis that reduce ACE2 levels in the cell may help in resisting infections.
Anyway, various professional unions and bodyguards recommend to continue the standard ACE paint and ARB therapy.
The systematic check and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "ACE painter users are associated with a 34% large reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with control."
Moreover, "the pneumonia rate is also reduced to patients who are treated by ACE pensions who have higher risks for pneumonia, especially for them with strokes and heart failures.
The use of ACE paints is also associated with the reduction of death rates related to pneumonia, even though the decision is less powerful than the whole risk of pneumonia."
Man's rejoining ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapist for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase hemodinamic pulmonary hemodinic oxygen in a pig child with syndrome in the respiration of the lipoacarida acid.
The rest of the life of the rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes in addition to the effect (three) for 24 hours.
Some discoveries recommend that rhACE2 can be a medicine that can be expected for them with inlerants on the anesthetical respiration system of angiotensin respiration (RAS) or in a disease that surrounds angiotensi II is enhanced. rhACE2 infusi is considered in clinical studies for syndrome treatments respiration.
The b'COVID-19 application of mobile software is designed to help tracking contacts as response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic pandemic, which is a process of identifying people ("related") which may relate to infected individuals.
Many applications were built or suggested by government officials supporting various territories and powers.
A number of works for building contact tracking applications are already developed.
Privacy is generated, especially about systems based on the user's geographic location.
Alternative is less disturbing including Bluetooth signal usage to record user proxy logs on another cell phone.
On April 1020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate the functionation to support applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating system.
In China, the Chinese government, collaborating with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check if they've ever had a relationship with those COVID-19 infected.
It was used throughout over 200 cities in China, in Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
An application was built by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launchs "StopKorna!", an application based on Bluetooth to trace the exposure with the potentially infected people and give a quick response to the authorities of health care.
The application was built by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Health Ministry.
As of April 1420, the application was waiting for graduation by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12 of April, the government declared that the transaction application is at the stage of advanced development, and will be available for launch in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand consider the application based on the applications TraceTogether Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. The Russian desires to introduce the geobce application for patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 who live in Moscow, designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with the system based on the application, including the wrong positive and the potential of infectation if the application is limited to only a few populations.
Coping anxiety about the inflagration of the "coronavirus" application, Apple sets a limit for types of organizations that can add coronavirus related applications to its Apps Store, limiting it to the "power" only or the name organization.
Google and Amazon have performed the same partition.
Privacy shutters express their concern about a mass surveillance effect using coronavirus applications, especially about whether infrastructure was created to handle the coronavirus pandemic pandemic will be stopped as soon as the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issue a fact requesting to have a limit over surveillance like this.
The organization declares eight conditions on government projects:
"Be careful of the law, if necessary."
further monitoring and surveillance should have unsettled clauses;
data usage should be limited to COVID-19;
The security of the data and the name must be protected and shown as protected by evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with the third party should be defined in the law;
Be protected against the abuse and rights of the citizens to respond to abuse;
activation means that all "concerned parties" should be needed, including public health experts and the abandoned group. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The Google/Apple design suggestions desire to handle ongoing surveillance problems by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating system as soon as it is necessary.
Some countries use localization based on networks instead of applications, removing both needs for downloading applications and ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, tracking was passed on by networks.
Solutions based on networks that have access to raw locations data have large potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with the centered server need to have access to the private location data; a number of privacy maintenance systems are created that use the base servers only for mutual communications (see sections below).
In South Korea, a system based on an application is used to do contact tracking.
Instead of using specific applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and this intersection generates notes through text messages to potential individuals infected.
In addition to using this information to warn the potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available for the public, something that is allowed for a major change in the information laws after the MERS plague in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. The countries including Germany consider to use the core system and privacy maintenance.
As of April 620, details haven't been broadcast yet.
The contact tracking with privacy maintenance is the concept recommended with the research literacy of the body is starting since 2013. As far as 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts work for privacy friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) for the user's proxy system on another mobile phone.
In any event, PEPP-PT is coordination efforts containing focus and unsubjected approach, and not a single protocol. Unlock protocol includes Mobile Protocol Proxy Proxy Proxy Proxy for Privilisation (DPPT/DP-3T), Temocular Contact Number (TCN, Fka, CEN), Protocolative Programs and Mechanism for Mobiles (PAC) and other.
In this protocol, a known personal data is sure never left the device, and all the matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab community is creating SafePaths, one platform to use privacy maintenance techniques when collecting and using location or data of each other the course section to track COVID-19ularization.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without disturbing data privacy.
On April 5 of 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by several groups united about the same method and large-entered protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and maiming global operation capabilities of acceleration and warning applications, an important aspect of reaching widespread usage.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has made the source open for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government application.
On April 10 of April 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the mobile platforms of Android and iOS, announced a initiative for the exploration of their charged contacts will maintain privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy criptography.
They also publish the core technology specification used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system desires to be launched in three levels:
Tool launching to allow the government to create coronavirus management tracking applications
Integration of this function directly into iOS and Android plans for Google and Apples to deal with the implementation and continue surveillance by first discarding the system through the update of the operating system, and then removing it in the same way as the threat just passed.

Vacsin COVID-19 is a hypothesis vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccine completes the clinical experiments, there are many trials in progress to wake the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it didn't expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, cause virus, to be available less than 18 months.
Five candidate vaccine is in the Fasa 1 security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The world's world's major outbreak in 2020, gave investment and investigation activity to wake up vaccine.
Many organizations are using the genome published to wake a vaccine maybe against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI initiative impensative for accelerating vaccine development, recycling capacity, periodic execution and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different tech platforms were under research and construction at the beginning of 2020 to create a powerful vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform proposes to advance into the Fasa I security study:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Fasa 1 and Vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vectors (Fasa I and potential vaccine Developers: Canno Biologicalcs, vector inovirus type 5)
As reported by the CEPI scientists in April, a number of 115 potential vaccines are in the initial stage of construction, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others are declared, but with little public information available (respected as plan or designed).
Fasa I-II attempts to run early security tests and munogenency, usually randomly, plasebo controlled and multiple sites, while specifying two effectively.
Level III usually involves more denomination including control group and test detection on vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for bad effects on two optimums.
Of 79 candidate vaccines in active development (as early as April 2020), 74 is not yet in human judgment) is still in "practical" research.

At the end of Mac, the Canadian government announced the repair of C$275 million for the research project on medical precautions against COVID-19, including many candidates of vaccine in Canada and Canadian universitys such as Medicago and the initiative of University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million special to wake the COVID-19 vaccine, with a plan to establish the national vaccine of some new vaccine that can be used if another coronavirrus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on PittCoVacc tests, the COVID-19 vaccine vaccine that may be in the mouse, stating that "MNA gives the subsecine subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodits of the strong antigen [in rat] that has been established 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of potential vaccine based on DNA as a possibility of nose tearers.
By using bacteriaofaj, DNA will be designed to imitate human bacteria to produce zarahs like harmless viruses, which can trigger immun systems to produce antibodis against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universitys gathered sources for supercomputer access to IBM, combined with the source of cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccine has heterologist effects, also called unspecified effects.
This means they can have benefits other than the disease they have prevented.
Random experiments in Australia were intended to register 4,170 health - care workers.
There are possible vaccines in unsafe or effective construction.
Early research to evaluate vaccine detection using COVID-19 specific animal models like ACE2 transgenic mouse, other makmal animals and non-man-human, indicates the need for biolevel 3 security rates to control life viruss, and international coordination to ensure standard security procedures.
Vaccis against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models, not human.
In 2020, no cure vaccine or protector for SARS had proved safe and effective on humans.
According to the research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identifying and development of vaccine and new medicines to care for the SARS were priorities for the government and public health agencies around the world as well as for no vaccine that had proved against the MERS.
When the MERS spread, an existing SARS investigation can be a useful template to wake the vaccine and the therapy against the MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there's one MERS vaccine that has completed the DNA, I'm the clinical test on humans, and the three others are running, all of them are virus vacccine vactors, two inoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector MVA (MA-MERSS).
The broadcasts on social media promote conspiracy theory that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known and a vaccine is already available.
Patents collected by various social media broadcasts refer to an existing patent for genetics and vaccine sequences for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
The b'Koronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection because of the heart condition of a syndrome syndrome respiration 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Normally waves include fever, coughing and packing breath.
The other spectacles may include fatigue, muscle disease, diarrhea, cavity, loss of smell and abdomen pain.
The time from exposure until the start of the glass was usually for five days but could begin between two and twelve days.
While obsessed with cases cause light symptoms, some progress into virus ventilation and multiple organ failures.
For 17 April 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported throughout 210 countries and regions, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
It especially spreads between people when they are close to one another, often through small coughs or insincere patterns.
While these titis are produced during breaths, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface instead of being infections for a long distance.
It has also been common for many people to be infected with an infectious surface and then to touch their eyes, their noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on the surface until 72 hours.
The most infected during the first three days after the start of the symptoms, even though the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and in the next stage of disease. The standard method is with the reaction of the actual transcryption chain (cRT-PCR) of the nasofaringeal swab.
The use of a mask is recommended to those who suspect themselves to bring their viruss and guards.
The recommendation for the use of the masks of common publics differs, with some authorities recommending no use, some recommend the use and others are obliged to use it.
At this time, no vaccine or special virus treatment for COVID-19.
Local illness transfers are recorded in most countries throughout the six regions of WHO.
Those who are infected with viruss may be as symptomatic or show symptoms like flus like fever, coughs, fatigue and breath distress.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, pains or chest pressure continuous, confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips; medical attention immediately served if these gelaja-gelas appear.
Less commonly, the upper end of breathing, such as silk, watered nose, or binocular pain may be noticed.
The gastrousus spectacles are like a loya, vomit and diarrhea are noted in multiple percent.
Some cases in China at first show only data and palpity.
In some areas, disease can develop into pneumonia, multiple organs and death failure.
It's called an immunity period.
An immutable period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of patients who show symptoms will do it in 11.5 days since infections. The report indicates that not all those infected are signaling symptoms.
This accematical harnessing role in transfer is still not fully known; however, the initial evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of disease.
Their increment that is infected doesn't show the unknown symptoms at this time and is being tested, with the Korean Control and Prevention Center (KDCC) reported that 20% of all cases confirmed to remain in their hospitals.
China's National Health Commission began to insert ass tomatomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; from 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) was asvasmetic at the time of testing.
Kahak and saliva can carry a lot of virus burdens.
Speaking strongly letting go more titis than talking normally.
One study in Singapore found that because of the failure to close the mouth, the rockets could move as many as 15 feet (15 feet) to drive.
Although the virus is not naturally, the National Science Academy suggests that bioaerosol transfer is possible and air collecter in position in the hallway outside of the room people show a lot of positive samples for the virus RNA.
Some such medical procedures as intubation and cardioppulmonari (CPR) may lead to respiration into aerosol and, in turn, result in delivery.
Even though there's a concern it spread through the chin, this risk is believed to be low, the virus is very contagious when those who have a symptoms; although the preaching is possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risks are low.
The European Center for Prevention Disease and Control (ECDC) mentioned even though it is not obvious about the impairment of disease, a person infects two to three people in general.
Particularly, the virus was found as possible for a day on a cardboad, so three days above plastic (polipropilena) and smoothly holding karats, and up to four hours over 99% copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature.
Sabuns and detergents also work when they are properly used; soap products weaken the layers of viral fat, deactivate them, and free them from skin and other surfaces.
Other strings such as benzalkonium chlorida and chlorhexydina glucloats. In a Hong Kong study, the example of saliva was taken for median for two days after the start of the hospital entry.
In five of six patients, the first sample shows the highest load of the virus, and the six patients show the highest load of the virus on the second day tested.
The Koronavirus syndrome syndrome syndrome met 2 (SARS-CoV-CoV-2) is a bad syndrome syndrome novel of respiration syndrome, the first separated from three people with pneumonia is related to the cluster case of acpiration act in Wuhan.
All the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus novels occur in the original connection coronavirus.
Out of human body, the virus was killed by the soap in the house, which blocked his protective bubbles.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesss the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin enzymes (ACE2), the most in the alveolus type of lungs.
Virus uses glycoprotein's special surface called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter host cells.
The acute cardiium injury was found in 12% of the infected people who were put into hospitals in Wuhan, China and more often in a bad disease.
High cardiovascular symptoms rates, due to systemic breakdown and immune system disease during the progress of disease, but acute miokardium injuries may also be associated with ACE2 reciper in the heart.
ACE2 reseptor is very much inside the heart and is involved in the heart function.
Inside high trombosis (31%) and tromembolism poison (25%) found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a weak prognosis. Autopsyen who died because COVID-19 has encountered alveolus crashed (AD), and the limfositation contained crash in the lungs.
Even though the SARS-COV-2 had tropicalme for ACE2 epitial expression cells on the respiratory channel, the patient with COVID-19 bad has systemic hyperactal symptoms.
Particularly, the T cell rexs the patogenic GM-CSF is shown to synchronize with monosit resemblance IL-6 and bad lung lungs in COVID-19 patients.
The limphystic decency is also reported during autopsy.
WHO published some test protocols for disease.
The standard testing method is the reaction of the political chain transcryption turning time (rPT-PCR).
The test is typically done on breathing samples obtained by swab nasofaringeal; however, a nose swab or a box sample may also be used.
The decision is usually available in just a few hours until two days.
The blood test can be used but it takes two blood samples taken from two weeks in line and its decision has a small amount of value.
The Chinese scientists are capable of reducing coronavirus strains and publishing genetic sequences so that the world's labs can freely wake up the test of polymerase chain (PCR) to detect the infection by the virus.
For 4 April 2020, antibodi tests (possibly detect active infection and whether someone was infected in the past) were in construction but not used extensively.
Chinese experience with testing has indicated only 60 to 70% accuracy.
The FDA in the United States has released the first initial care test on 21th March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guideline was published by the Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan University suggested the method for jangkitation based on clinical and the risk of epidemiology.
The opacity of glass collapsed with a hybrid distribution, asimmetric and postposts were common in early infections.
Dominans subples, many coverages (cluttered sockets with multiple alveolus filling) and unifications may arise when disease rises.
Some data can be found about monoscopics and COVID-19 patopsy.
The founding of the primary patology when autopsy is:
Makroscopei: pleury, perichistics, lungtuation and pulmonary edema
Four types of accelerators for viral pneumonia can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocation, hiperplasia, large typical pneumocation, invasion of spaces with limphic abuse and formation of multinukleat giant cells
bad pneumonia: difused alveolus damage (DAD) with a difused alveolus extension.
DOD is the cause of the syndrome instress of acute respiration (ARDS) and bad hyphosemia.
restoring pneumonia: Exuting support in alveolus and phybrosis pulmonary spaces
Blood: intravaskular coagulanization spread (DIC), leukoeritroblatic design
Steps of prevention to reduce infection include living at home, preventing people, often washing hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing cleanness and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouths with unstoppable hands.
The CDC recommends that it closes the mouth and nose with a tissue when it rhythms or siphons and recommends the use of the inside of the shoulder if no tissue.
The proper cleanup of the hands after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of the cover of cloths in the public, partly to limit transfers by a person who has a symptom. The social prison strategy is intended to reduce the relationship of those infected with the large group through school closing and place, limiting trips and canceling large public meetings.
The intercept guide lines also include for the crowd to be at least six feet (1.8 m) away among them.
No drugs are known to be effective to prevent COVID-19, because the vaccine is unexpected until at most in 2021, the main thing in handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce epidemic peaks, known as "scale hardness".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the restroom or when the hands look dirty, before eating or after eavesting their nose, coughs or goughs.
More recommends to use an alcohol consumption based on hands with at least 60% of alcohol but only when soap and water are not provided. For areas that have no business-evaluation, WHO provides two consumptions for local production.
In this mess, antimicrob activity appears from etanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen of oxide is used to help get rid of bacteria' spores in alcohol; it's not "the active material for hand antisepsis".
Gliserol added as a slider.
Multitudes are cared for with support care, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital effects.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects themselves has a virus to wear a simple face mask.
The esktrakporeum membraneogenation is used to handle the respiratory failure issue, but the advantage is still under consideration.
Personal cleanness and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
The support treatment may be useful for them with light symptoms at the early stage of infection.
Critical care members and pneumonologists in the U.S.A. collecting treatment disposers from various agencies as free sources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no special treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for the use of the first line.
The precaution is to be taken in to minimize the risk of virus transfer, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosol, such as intubation or hand landing.
For health care professionals to keep those COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person is put in the Confidence Room of the Confidence (AIIR) in using standard precautions, precautions and precautions. CDC provides a guideline for the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during pandemic pandemic.
Approached equipment is: PPE dresses, respiratory or facial masks, eyebrows and medical gloves, if available, breathing (better than facial mask) is more important.
The N95 Respirator passed by the industry settings but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used under the EU (EA) Use Truth.
It's designed to protect from a lifelike particles like powder but it's effective against special biology agents not secure for use outside labels.
When the mask cannot be found, the CDC recommends the use of the face shield or as the final option, the mask itself.
Most cases COVID-19 are not bad until it requires mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percent need it.
Type of breathing support for individuals with COVID-19 is linked to an active respiratory failure being tested for patients in the hospital with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by high-ligned nose canula or positive air channel pressure two stages.
Whether these two are giving the same benefit to people who are critically ill are unknown.
Some doctors chose to remain with mechanical ventilation if it could be found because these techniques are blocking the spread of aerosol particles rather than the nose of highstreams.
Many built countries don't have enough hospital beds per capita, which restrict the health system capacity to handle a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases that require a hospital entry.
A study in China found 5% that was entered into a regular care unit, 2,3% needed mechanical support of ventilators and 1.4% dead.
In China, at least 30% of patients in the hospital with COVID-19 will be put to ICU at the end.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated because the syndrome is in myt's respiration in COVID-19 and the activation is getting harder.
Ventilators can control high pressure and PEP are required to maximize oxygen presentation while implying the risk of ventilator and pneumotoraks related lung injuries.
High PEP may not be available on longer ventilator.
Research for potential treatment began in January 2020, and some antivirus drugs were in clinical experiments.
Remdesivir appears as most expected.
Even if new drugs may take up to 2021 to be built, some medications are being tested have been proposed for other uses already in further tests.
Antivirus drugs may be tested to people who suffer serious illnesses.
WHO recommends volunteers to take part in potentially improvised attempts and care security.
It hasn't been through clinical research needed to show it safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched mobile applications to deal with disease.
Users were asked to enter their names and IDs.
This application can detect a close connection using surveillance data and thus risk for potential infections.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends a self-expansive quarantine, it also warns local health authorities.
In March 2020, the Israelite government permitted security agencies to track down their mobile phone data.
Steps are taken to enforce quarantine and protect those associated with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutche Telkom shared the data at the location of the aggregate telephone with the German federal agency, Robert Koch Institute, to oversee and prevent preaching virus.
The Russians run the facial recognition technology to track the cuarantin mix.
The Italian health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by the mobile phone handler that "40% of people kept moving everywhere."
The German government runs hackhon end of 48 hours with more than 42.000 participants.
Also President Estonia, Kaljulaid Kersti called to the world for the creative solution to coronavirusularularularity.
Individuals may face pressure from quarantine, travel partitions, effects from treatments, or fear of their own infections.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, pressure and economicity are thousands of perfect mental health and well-being that threaten people's mental health and well-being."
Disease will cause a light effect in a little or no symptoms, like normal top respiration disease like normal celema.
A mild recovery was common for two weeks.
A pregnant woman may risk a high risk getting a bad COVID-19 infection based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is less than a few people, COVID-19 might affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those who are seriously affected, COVID-19 can quickly become syndrome at act respiratorys (ARDS) caused respiratory failure, second shock, or multiple organ failures.
Complications are related to COVID-19 including the sepsis, unnatural dissolution and damage to the heart, the kidneys and the heart.
Imnatural executions, especially increase in protrombin time, have been visible in a total 6% of those who were put into the hospital with COVID-19, while the kidney function is unusually noticed in 4% of this group.
At least 20-30% of the crowd infected COVID-19 indicates the increase in the enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median between the start of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the hospital entry.
Anyway, patients are transferred to the ICU have a median time for seven days between hospital entry and death.
In the early case study, the median of the initial indication of symptoms until the death is 14 days, with a six-and - 41 - day coverage.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China, the man has a death rate of 2.8% while women with a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopatology checking on post-mortem lung samples indicate alveolus damage is fused with advanced mobile fibromisoids in both lungs.
Virus sytopath changes noted in pneumost.
The lung image shows a syndrome of actt respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the death reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by the rise of troponin or kardiium.
According to Mac's month data from the United States, 89% of those who are put in the hospital with existing health conditions, the availability of medical and region socioconomy may also affect the death rate.
Estimated death rates from different conditions because of their differences in territory, but also because of medical difficulty.
The lower count of a light case can cause much budget for death rates.
Anyway, the fact that death is caused by an infection in the past can mean the time death rate.
Smokers have 1.4 times more likely to experience the bad symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 more likely to need to take care of the world or die than those who don't smoke.
The Hong Kong Hospital's government found 20% deployment to 30% in lung capabilities in some patients who recover from disease, and the lung scans suggest organ damage.
It may also lead to the syndrome after the regular care of recovery.
As far as March 2020, it's not known that earlier infections gave effective immunity and long-term in those who recover from this disease.
Imunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behavior, but in case with the recovery of COVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for coronavirus at a date that has been reported.
All these cases are believed to be worse with long-term infections than recycling infections.
The virus is resemblance and comes from animals, through floods.
The real origin is unknown but until December 2019 the total infection is nearly driven through the transfer of humans to humans.
A study for the first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, exposed the initial date of symptoms is on December 1, 2019.
The official Publishing of WHO reported the beginning of the symptoms is on December 8, 2019.
Some steps are usually used to measure death rates.
These numbers are different from the region and according to time and are influenced by the number of tests, health systems quality, treatment options, periods since early infections and characteristics of populations such as age, sex and whole health.
At the end of 2019, WHO sets the ICD-10 emergency code of U07.1 for the death of the SARS-CoV-2 infections verified by the death of a mamal and U07.2 for the death of the SARS-CoV-CoV2 infection without confirmation of the COVID-19 makmals that are diagnosed clinical or epidemiology. The mortal ratio of deaths corresponding to the number of deaths that are disadivided by the number of diagnosis in the given time.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of death over global cases is 6.9% (153,82/2,240,191) by 17 April 2020.
The number is different by regions. The other steps include cases death rate (CFR), which reflect the percentage of individuals diagnostically died from disease, and the rate of infections (IFR) that reflect the percentage of individuals infected (diagnostics and undiagnosed) that the world is killed by disease.
These statistics are not controlled in time and obey certain populations from infections to case solutions.
While not everyone wakes antibodies, antibodi presence may provide information about the number of people infected.
In the heart of the Italian infection, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, disease is spread by Carnival's party, and exposure to younger people, causing a lower death rate in comparison, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially covered.
Moreover, Germany’s health system is still not extreme.
In the Netherlands, at least 3% may have an antibodi as considered from the bloodder.
69 (0.004% of population) confirmed deaths the world due to COVID-19.
Pandemic images and death rates differ for men and women.
The death rate is higher for men in research is conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is that they are in their 50s, with the gap between men and women graving only at the age of 90.
In China, death rate is 2,8 percent for men and 1,7 percent for women.
The real reason for the difference of this sex is unknown but genetic factors and behavior may be the reason.
Differences of immunology based on sex, a lack of smoking enzyme in women and men form morbid conditions together like hypertension at a younger age than a woman could contribute to higher death rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected are men and 72% of the number that died because COVID-19 is a man.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not traced sex data for COVID-19 infection.
Research suggests that blue diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women.
A higher dosage of health employees, especially the nurse, is the female sheathers and has higher infections against viruses.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that this disease's official name is "COVID-19".
WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO succept for crown, VI for the virus, D for disease and 19 for the first time the plague must be identified: December 31, 2019.
The name selected to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), the species of animals or crowd groups, in line with the international dissociation of the name to avoid stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 syndrome syndrome to be named a terrible acpiration 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Further WHO uses the COVID-19 virus and "virus responsible for COVID-19) in public communication.
Both diseases and viruss are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During early exposure in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases are commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and a 2019-nCoV respiration disease as a temporary name for virus and disease based on the use of location for disease and virus.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was announced on February 11, 2020.
Because of the capacity boundary, some digital debris issued health care materials such as nose swab and ventilator parts.
In one example, when the Italian hospital needs a ventilator in immediately, and the supplier can't send it on the necessary scale of time, one start of the engineering around the local and produces 100 inchs that are needed all night.
After beginning COVID-19, conspiration theory, misrepresentation and incorrect information came up in terms of origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease and spread on online quickly.
Humans have the ability to spread virus to some other animals.
Research failed to find evidence of the virus's copying in chenzir, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccine are proposed to treat the disease.
International research on the vaccine and the 19th COVID drugs are being employed by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In Mac, the World Health Organization started " SOLIDARITY experimenting" to evaluate the effects of antiviral treatment at the moment with the most predictable detection.
No vaccine can be found but various agencies are actually developing an active vaccine candidate.
The previous attempt on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 used ACE2 recipeers to enter human cells.
There are three invading strategies being investigated.
First, researchers suggest to build virus vaccine in general.
The use of the virus is either active or dead, intended to get an immediate response to the human body against new infections with COVID-19.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, is intended to create a sensitive vaccine with the immune system in some subunits.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, the investigation was piled on a S-pack protein that helped the virus disabling the ACE2 enscriptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccine (the DNA or RNA vaccine, novel techniques to create a revaction).
The experimental vaccine from any of these strategy needs to be tested for safety and detection on March 16, 2020, the first clinical experiment began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vacsin contains unprotected genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease. An antibodi dependency dependencies are recommended as a potential challenge to the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a conflict.
There have been over 300 active clinical trials under way since April 2020.
Seven evaluate trials have been proposed as a treatment for malaria, including four studies to the above hidroksichloquine or chloroquine.
The alternate antivirus drugs include most Chinese investigations, with nine experiments of Phase III over the remdesivir for some countries have to be reported by the end of April.
A clinical check for COVID-19 vaccine and candidates are provided for April 2020. Some antiviral drugs are currently being considered for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydrochlocheloquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir joining with interferonavir.
There's a tentactive evidence for detection by the redesivir so far as not 2020.
The clinical growth is noted in a patient’s care for with loving use of remdesivir.
Chloroquine was used to treat malaria beforeji in China in February 2020, making a predecessor.
Anyway, there's a call to reexamination the same research.
Korean Power and Chin recommend the use of chloroquine.
After all, Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending two dailys as one gram, admits that two times are very dangerous and can bring death.
On 28th March 2020, the FDA published the truth of the use of emergency for hydroxicloquine and chloroquine according to the words of the medical specialists who were infected COVID-19. The 7th Chinese guideline also includes interferon, onviron or umifenovir to use against COVID-19.
The early data indicates that the high two onvirins are necessary to reinject SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for further research in vivo after showing low spectation on SARS-CoV-2. Research indicates that the initial upgrade of protein by serina protease transmembran 2 (TMPRSSS2) is important for the SARS-CoV-2 entry through the interaction with the ACE2 recipe.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxchloquine together or without azithromyycin has a major limit that prevents medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not renect SARS-CoV-CoV2 in vitro and no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
The stokinstorm can be complication in the next level for the bad COVID-19.
There's evidence that hydroxychloroquine has an antisitokin storm feature. Tocilizumab has been put in the medical guideline by the National Health Suruhanjaya of China after a small study completed.
It's not a random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing a positive decision with a bad disease.
Combined with a cerebral feritine test to identify the sitokin storm, this means to fight the development, which is considered the cause of death for some infected people.
Antagonist interleukin-6 reseptor aggregate by the FDA based on a retrocutative case study for sytokin release syndrome refraktori steroids caused by different reasons, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
Until now, there's no random evidence that tocilibulabs are effective treatments for the CRS.
Transfering antibodies are engraved and deafened by their immune system that heals from COVID-19 to those who need it are being tried as a non- vaccine method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tried on SARS with no conclusive decision.
The virus neutralization is the experimented action mechanism of passive antibodi therapy can be defensive defensive defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, are such as a possible antibodi dependencies and/or fagositosis.
Another form of passive antibodi therapy, for example, uses monoclon antibodies produced in construction.
Recovering the serum, which consists of blood fluids from recovered patients and contains special antibodies on this virus can be enhanced for faster execution.
coronavirus disease, a connected syndrome group.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Central Hospital of Wuhan, later infected and died because of COVID-19 after creating awareness of virusularity.
