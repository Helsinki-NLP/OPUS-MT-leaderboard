The councilman Wales is worried about the look like a doll.
There's a belief among several AMs for the proposal of their nicknames should be changed to the MWP (Anggota Wales Parliament).
It occurred because of a plan to change the name of the trial to the Wales Parliament.
AM's whole political spectrum is afraid it can invite a break.
A AM part of the Buruh Party commented: “The participants took a major ‘imize ’ with ‘Twp ’ and ‘Pwp ’ interest. ”
For outside reader Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means 'gila' and 'pwp' means ‘najis'.'
AM of Plaid says, the whole party is 'unhappy' and has suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Wales said his party was "opened up" about change of name, but he said it was a brief oral jump from the MWP to the Boneka.
In this context, the term ‘w ’ in Wales is termed similar to the English of Yorkshire (“u ”).
He said: "The command of the Council must be a matter for its own people."
The Wales Kingdom Act of 2017 gave authority to the Wales council to change his name.
In June, the Sugganjaya informed public negotiations of cadangan that got a large support to call the council as Wales Parliament.
Regarding the AM title, the Commission of the Wales and the WMP Parliament, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public negotiation.
The AM seems to suggest alternative options, but trouble to reach the agreement and can eject the head of the Honor Officer, Elin Jones, who was expected to give the legal warrant about changes in a few weeks.
The law on the change of other changes entered by the way the ceremony works, including the rules about loss of the AM and design of the committee system.
AM will get the last vote on the question of what to say when they discuss the laws.
Macedonia has made a vote in the referendum about changing the name of the country
The voter would vote on Sundays whether they would convert the name of their country to ‘ Macedonian North Republic. ’
A popular vote was set up in an attempt to settle disputes for several decades with the neighboring Greek State, with its own Macedonian territory.
Athens has long asserted that it was the name of the neighbor of the north side of the area to represent his charges on the area and has repeatedly contradicted his membership offer for the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the fight against the change of the name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that change of name is just the price to pay to join the EU and NATO union.
The Bell of St. Martin Silent 'cause the Churches are in the midst of Harlem.
"The old man I met said, according to history, there were bars and churches in every corner of the street," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, both are gone."
He said the lost bar is understood.
"The crowd is socializing in different ways now," he said.
"Bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people are going always."
For the church, he's worried about the money from an asset sales won't last long as the leaders expect it, "and they'll come back soon where they started.
The churches, he said, can be replaced by the buildings of apartments and condominium that are inhabited by people who do not want to help keep the holy place still in this neighborhood.
"The man who's gonna buy the condominium in this building is a white man," he said, "and so will make these churches completely closed because it's not possible that most people who go into this condominium will become members of the churches."
The two churches were built by white people before Harlem became black - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
Methuselah travels in the 1930s.
The black man who has worshipped nearby has taken the property of the building.
St. Martin has been taken over by the blacks under the Honored John Howard Johnson, who presided at 125th Street, a major way to buy out at Harlem, who opposes the change of black skin in the job.
The fire in 1939 broke the building badly, but as Pastor's priest, Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bells.
David Johnson, a son and a substitute Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly calls the tower bell a ‘ poor people.'
One who played the carilon in July called it something else: ‘ From a cultural archive ’ and ‘ a history industry cannot be replaced. ’
Pakar, Tiffany Ng of University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world that would be played by black musicians, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger bell in the Churchside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin for the last few months has been a complex of architects and contractors, some were taken by church leaders, others by the Episcoal bishops.
The Vestri - the body of the congregation administration, made up of the public leader - writing the bishop in July with the concern the bishop "will try to get cost out of the vestri room, even though the vestri room is not involved in the architecture and contractor that the bishop brought in.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of intelligence in the bishops ’ department.
Jerung hurt 13-year-olds when diving for a caravan in California
A shark attacked and harmed a 13 - year - old boy in Saturday when he was diving for a refrigerator in California on the opening day of the rust, said the officers.
The attack occurred before 7: 00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinity.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screamed for help and then strolled along with a bunch of people to help pull him out from the water.

I have to bite!"
The whole bone of his bone has been torn and opened," Hammel said he noticed when he got the boy.
"I yelled to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Add Hammel.
The children were flying to Rady's Boy Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical circumstances.
The species of sharks who are responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in the media's covert that the sharks had been found in that area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed the harmless shark species.
Giles added to the victim's trauma injuries on the top of his body.
Officers closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinity for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles states there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sciencebury Plan to enter the beauty market in UK
Sciencebury took Boots, Superdreg and Debenhams from the beauty style space in the soneka building controlled by the expert assistants.
As part of the effort to enter the beauty market that is worth £2.8 billion in the UK, which continues to flourish while the sales of fashions and home equipment, larger beauty spaces will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and are taken to more buildings next year if they produce success.
The investment in beauty shows up when the market finds ways to use a record room that used to be charged for TV, microwaves and home equipment.
Sciencebury says it's going to double the size of her beauty offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaww for the first time.
Multiple products are available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more spaces with the beacon parts the same as in stores like Boots.
The market also redirected Boutique's sole products to make the majority of the product friendly vegans a growing demand by the buyer of young people.
Besides, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will test the concessions in two sciencebury markets, the first opened in Croydon, southern London, last week while the second one was opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, the end of this year.
Buying online and turning toward buying some food every day at the local store means that the market needs to work more to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, the executive leader of Sciencebury, said the branch would look like a soneka building looking at a chain of markets trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more services and product instead of food.
Sciencebury puts the Argos branch in hundreds of stores and has also introduced some places since it bought both chains two years ago, it was said to have increased the sales and made the gain more profitable.
The former market wanted to modify the beauty and farming that ended with a failure.
Sciencebury tested the same effort as Boot in the early year 2000, but it ended up after he told me how to divide the income from the farming store at his market.
New strategy showed up after Sciencebury sold 281 farming shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi chain, at the price of £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the design, by adding a variety of fancy leather caremarks including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the comersil Sciencebury, said, "We've changed our looks and appearance in our beauty room to improve the environment for our clients.
We also invested with specially trained friends to offer advice.
Our brands were designed to fill every need, and an exciting environment and a comfortable location meant that we now are an exciting beauty destination.
Peter Jones' lined' after Holly Willoughby pulls an offer £11 million
Peter Jones, King Dragons' Den, 'saw' after Holly Willoughby's TV dealt £11 million with his style style business to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for home and accessories from Jenama Truly.
The couple's business is likened to Goop's title by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's morning, 37, using Instagram to announce that he'll stop.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star in Den, Peter Jones, in an angry mood by pulling himself out of a lucrative style business business at the end of the-- to focus on his extraordinary new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources tell Jones that when the successful TV woman admitted at the tense meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer was worth up to £1.5 million - means she had no time to devote the house and accessories to the real name.
The business was likened to the name Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's wealth worth £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was going to leave the truth, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacations.
The source says, "All this time, it really has been Holly's priority.
It'll be the future of his long-term that can witness him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved is really shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to that launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff at Marlow's headquarters ready to be sold."
Experts believe this Morning, which is one of the most acceptable stars in the banks in Britain, can invest a million-jumped firm because of large investments in products that consist of fashions and candles up to clothes and household items, and potentially to delay the launch.
And it can be the end to that friendship.
Willoughby, Mother to three children and husbands and Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, with him as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40% shares in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be a brand for M
The sources close to Jones said last night, "We won't discuss his business."
A strong conversation 'and then we fall in love'
He's joking about the criticism that the news media will accept for making a comment that in part would consider ‘ unnatural to the president' and very positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why does President Trump give up over?
Trump also says with a voice ‘ news reader. ’
"I never gave up losing."
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June has been converted by Trump as a big step toward the North Korean nuclear program.
But the negotiation of a nuclear breakdown program is delayed.
More than three months after Jun's final congregation in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen the " similar response" from the United States about the early train movement of North Korea.
Instead, he said, U.S. continues the partition intended to maintain pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his meeting speech.
"Our relationship is good with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to fight with North Korea.
A lot of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair relationships with Kim had brought a positive decision - ending rocket test, helped free the ransom, and took the American army back to the homeland first.
And he kept his extraordinary approach in talking about connections with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this dense arena, we'll have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing people in front of him directly.
The English and the Momps destroy the islands, killing hundreds.
After the quake of the Lombok, for example, non - foreign government organizations indicated that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok were transferred, no national disaster was declared, as a condition to establish international help.

When Save the Children together in a team goes to the Tree, it's not sure whether foreign staff can work at the scene.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster agency spokeswoman, said the Indonesia officer evaluated the situation in the Tree to see if the international agency will be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
According to the earth’s often - facing victories, the country will not be prepared to deal with natural disasters.
Although the tsunami shelter was built at Aceh, it was not a common view on other beaches.
The shortage of the tsunami alert in the Tree, even though the warnings have proved to be powerful, it's like contributing to the loss of life.
In the best time, the journey between the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disaster makes logics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for the victim of an earthquake is heading toward the Tree, but it took at least three days to get to the location of a new disaster.

The statue of Cromwell Parliament is a recent reminder that has been in the history of reproductive writing.
His extermination will be the puitis justice for the destruction of his Taliban with so many ancient and English culture of artifacts and religions that his fanatic Puritans did.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's proposal as 'Stupid' and ‘ tried to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, says: "There is no way to be avoided in the language now about the disposing of the statues whose character Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster is going to be a target.
Iconoclasme from the British civil war is either directed or run by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed because of the actions of Thomas's ancestors of the past century.
The beautiful representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft against Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century and a part of the history of many people who believe are still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered a lot, more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in a state of a Monarki.
Whether it's a full representation of being an ongoing historical language subject.
What is certain is the mid-17th conflict that has formed the development of our next country, and Cromwell is a person known as a figure representing one part divided.
He is the Lord of the Protector.
Chinese Mapni Pigs to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the southwest Chinese market, according to the local media report.
The man, known as his family's name "Yuan," was found dead with an artery broken, filled with blood near a market in the Guizhou region of South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005, in the Qinghai Territory, China.
He reported traveling with his cousin of Yunnan's region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and he found one pork on the open door.

Forensic check confirms that the pig 550 pounds had beat the farmer to death, according to the report.
"His family" Wu, said, as the Petang Guiyang News quotes.
The security cameras indicate the Yuan entered the store at 4:40 in Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Animals killed the man wasn't the Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Night News that the pig has been locked to stop him from attacking others, while the police are collecting evidence at the scene.

They're nipper, so curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay with the right amount of honor,' said it.

Over 20 million people see Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony in Thursday by the candidate of the Brettt Kavanaugh Court and the woman who accused him of being attacked sexually at the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television networks.
In the meantime, the political courtesy continued, with publishers interrupting the usual programming for Friday's last minute touch: a deal designed by Arizona Sene. Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate for a week about the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had her rababa and tried to open her clothes at high school.
Kavanaugh, in his description, says 100 percent of it doesn't happen.
It's probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watch it.
The company thinks the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numerics are not available immediately for other networks that indicate PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
And Nielsen usually has a problem measuring people at the office.
To put it in perspective, it's the size of the audience is the same as the football game or the Academy Anuger.
Fox News Channel, who thinks the host has supported Kavanaugh appointments, leading all the networks with an average of 5,69 million audiences on hearing all day, said Nielsen.
ABC is second to 3,26 million audiences.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The Faedah remains high after hearing.
Flake is the main character in this Friday drama.
After the simple Republican office issued the fact that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as CNN and CBS's camera in the morning Fridays were kicked by a sense pointer when he tried to climb the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He was standing with a poor eye for a few minutes when he was preschooled, directly shown in CNN.
"I stood here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have the power when many women don't have power."
Says Flake: “The office says that before the elevator is closed, a large number of words will be heard from the committee.
Cabel networks and broadcasts all cover the clock directly later, when the Justice Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh calibration to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with understanding that the FBI would see the charges against the penma next week, democracy minority pressing.
Flake's sure some conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen, Chris Coons.
After Coons and some senator after that, Flake made a decision.
This Flake option does have power, because it's obviously the Republicans won't have a vote to free Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI investigation on the charge of Kavanaugh.

Livingston has surprised Rangers to deliver Steven Gerrard to second defeat in 18 fights as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Dolly Commission proved different when Gary Holt's army moved with Hibernian in second place.
The Gerrards remain without victory in Premiership this season and face the head of Hearts, which they're going to track with eight eyes, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers became Rapid Vienna's host in the European League of Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston extended undefeated flights in this part until six games, with the leader of Coach Holt who still felt defeat since the replacement of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opponent.
The Holt team should be far ahead before getting the goal, with their involvement, causing Rangers to face all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but handed it over on a gol, but Alan Lithgow can only give up his business after prolonging to Craig Halkett's horn.
The houselord is eager to let Rangers play in front of them, aware that they can make a problem to the opponent with a set piece.
And that's the way the important goal exists.
Rangers admitted free football and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set the hierarchy, which took the touch and the goal tissue from the box center.
At that level, Rangers had mastered the ownership but had found the defense of a house that could not penetrate and the Kelly goalkeeper was most of no problem,
That pattern continued to the second time, even though Alfredo Morelos forced to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by the warehouse Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow kicking the gol from another livingston match.
Crosses kept going into the Livingston box and kept clearing, while two demands of penalty - after the problem of the Halckettt replacement of Glenn Middleton, and one for a long handball.
'Fenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Lamont Alasdair of BBC Scotland in Arena Tony Macaroni
What an extraordinary performance and the result for Livingston.
To the man, they're very brilliant, and they're going beyond the expectations of this recesses.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since returning to the top level, but a big credit has been forced to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett is very brave, establishing a great orderly defense, while I am holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
Rangers are less inspired, though.
It's good like they're sometimes under Gerrard, they're falling away from that standard.
The last ball was a little short-- just once they cut off the host's team-and it was a call for Rangers to wake up, who found themselves at the middle table.

Hundreds of an anti-Erdogan's anti-Erdogan-most they are Kurdi - also made their voices hear, condemn both the base of Erdogan and the German government decision to respond to that country.
Wars depict the happiness of a visitor to be commended as a hero by some Turkish people and disfellowshipd as an autocart by others.

Another area in the Southwest Desert includes Rockies and Basin Great may have 1 to 2 inches, with a remote number so maybe 4 inches.
For them of the risk of lightning flooding, Rosa may have been merciful since this region was dilanda a drought.

"The vote of Judge Kavanaugh is voted to reject a vicious and extreme tactic in Democratic Party, "the word Trump at meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been "releasing a terrible, angry" Party of Democratics along the process.
Kavanaugh gave a report before Congress on Thursday, strongly denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford he had sexually attacked at the time of the decade when he was a teenager.
Ford also gave the hearing of his charges.
The TPresiden said on Saturday "American heroes see the brilliance and quality and courage" Kavanaugh that day.

hundreds of lives were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami, with an increasing number of tolls
At least 384 people were killed, many were struck by the giant waves on the beach, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Indonesia in Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in the city of the Tree on Friday when the wave was six feet [6 m] high [6 m]] crashed on the ground at sunset, wiped out many deaths and destroyed everything that was on their way.
Tsunami followed the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred last night, the crowd were still doing activities on the beach and didn't run and they became victims, "The Purwo Nugroho, the Indonesia BNPB disaster arrest agency said in a district in Jakarta.
"Tsnami didn't come by himself, he dragged trains, logs, houses, he attacked his smush on the ground, "and added that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) speed before the edges.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and said that they were safe.
Some 16.700 people have been transferred to 24 centers in the Paluu.
Photographs of air emitted by a disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges turning around and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The end of the wall continues to shake the city off the beach on Saturday.
A number of follows are felt in areas with 2,4 million inhabitants.
The U.S. Testing and the Technology Agency of Indonesia says in one fact that energy released by a strong earthquake on Friday last was about 200 times the energy of atom bombs dropped in Hiroshima in Second World War.
The city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, might have increased the size of tsunami waves, says the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as ‘ expanding' and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of victims were found trapped under the collapse of the building and said that another 540 people were injured and 29 others were still missing.
Nugroho says a life and destruction may be even more severe along the coastline of 300 miles (190 km) north of the Palu, a region called Donggala.
"Communition really disconnected without any information' from Donggala," said Nugroho.
"Over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross Team in one reality by adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy but it can be worse," said the Red Cross.
The Agency was severely criticized on Saturdays by not reporting that the tsunami strucklu, even though the officials had said that the tsunami occurred within the period of the warning was issued.
In an amateur video on social media, a man heard a loud shouting toward the crowd on the road about the presence of tsunami.
In a few minutes, the tsunami waves set up the beach and pulled along with the buildings and cars.
Reuters cannot confirm the authenticity of the video recording.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major warboat that broke the communications around the Tree, and this made it difficult for the authorities to carry on the search.
The army sent relief with cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the migration of residents still required much more food and material necessities, said the authorities.
The airport was reopened for help only and it would remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer center in the Tree on Sunday.
The Death Numeral Deploys of Indonesia's Tsunami Crabs to 800 people.
It was very bad.
When Staf World Vision of Donggala survived to the city of the Tree, they went through the disaster place, the workers took refuge under the tarpal cloth built in the front of their offices in the Tree, said Mr. Dobus.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Although the relief team began to provide disaster relief in a bleak setting, some told foreign assisters who had deep experiences led to the Tree.
Administration, maintenance of needs, and sending workers from foreign countries are regulated by Indonesia only if disaster zones are announced.
That still doesn't happen.
"It's still a disaster on the area level," said Aulia Ariani, coacher of the Red Cross Force.
"When the government says "OK, it's a country disaster," then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status."
When the second night at the Tree after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing family expect those whom they loved to be a miracle that appears and cheers them out of sorrow.
On Saturday, a boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers arrived when women found themselves trapped under a rock crouch for two days, with her mother’s corpses lying nearby.
The Subandono Gendon, the trainer of the Indonesia UN paralumps has trained two missing launchers of the earthquake for the Asian Sukan that had ended in the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel is the student, said Mr. Mandalagi.
"As a senior in the field of paralunts, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how he's really sending the message WhatsApp to the participants in Palu who joined the beach festival after a few hours of news about the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa spread among the paraluns' community.
The message sent only has one gray-colored racing mark over two blue-colored rates.
"I don't think the message is there," he said.

Canye West: Singers change their name to Ye
Rap Singer, Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Assuming his name in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, called Ye for a moment and he used that call as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change occurred when it appeared in the Saturday Night Live plan where he was expected to launch his latest album Yandhi.
"She replaced the Grande singer who canceled it in the plan for the ‘ emotional trouble,'" said the maker of the design.
Previously, Kanye West said that the name has a religious meaning and is also a shortage for his professional name now.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word found in the Gospel book and it means 'you,' says Kanye West in the beginning of this year when it's discussed his album title with Big Boy radio host.
"So I am you, too, we are us.
It turns from Kanye, which means only one, to Ye - an image of good reflection, our badness and mistakes and all of them.
That album is more to our own real image reflection."
He was one of the famous rap singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known for various names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announces that he prefers the name of Love and Brother Love.
A former Kanye West cooperative partner, JAY-Z can also accept it without or with silk marks and letters.

The United States should double the artificial intelligence fund
"The United States should double the amount of funding in artificial intelligence because China is becoming more active in that field," said the investor and affinity engineering Kai-Fu Lee who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That view was expressed after the U.S. government made an announcement of artificial intelligence, even though the United States has completely lacked the official intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced the plan in the past year by suggesting to be the number 1 in the innovation of intelligence by 2030.
"Moving the study of artificial intelligence is a good start in view of all other nations behind the United States and we want to have the next success in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
"By multiplying the funds can increase the great achievement of artificial intelligence in the United States," Lee said in the interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee's book of ‘A Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO Sinovation Ventures who had invested in one of the famous company in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he was working on an artificial system that had defeated the American Othello player who was in the best position while still studying at the Carnegie Mellon University, and then he became executive in Research Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch office.
Lee recognized the former American government technology contest as the Challenge Robot of the Station of the Defense Research Project Agency and wanted to know when the next competition will be held so he could identify new talents.
"Phonemen in the United States usually have to work hard to win the government's help," said Lee.
"Not China took the leaders of the academics but the corporation company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech company have appointed great talents from the university to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the basic immigration changes can also help the United States support his creative intelligence.
"I think a green card should automatically be offered to PhD graduate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued the Building Development Generation in July 2017.
"The reproduction of Science So the Chinese country provides funds for people in an academic institution, it equals the way the State Science Foundation and other government organizations divides funding to American researchers, but the academic work quality in China is lower," said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Defense Department established the Conclusion Centres that were intended to gather partners from industry and academics.
In this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF also invests over $100 million each year in an AI investigation.

The Macedonians made voices to change the name of the country.
The Macedonians followed a sound on the ahad day to determine a change in the name ‘ North Macedonian Republic ’ that was about to settle a dispute with Greece that for a decade when Greece had prevented Macedonia from joining the Union (EU) and the establishment of the North Atlantic Perjanjian (NATO).
The Macedonian province of Greece, whose own territory is Macedonia, promoted by the name "Macedonia" over his territory and had decided to denounce Macedonian in NATO and U.S.
The two kingdoms agreed on the idea of changing names in June but the nationalist changer said that the conversion degraded the Macedonian ethnic identity of the most majority of its citizens was Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he wouldn't vote in the whistle and the venturation caused any doubt whether the sound punctuation would reach the minimum 50 percent of the vote needed to be valid.
The question on the pencil is written: "Do you agree to be a member of NATO and EU with a acceptance of agreement with Greece?"
The convertor of the name includes the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said, "The acceleration of the new name is a price paid to join the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the nations that appeared after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for the young men in Macedonia so that they could live free under the European Union because that means our lives safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although it's illegal on the side of the law, the parliamentists say that they're going to obey the votes to make it muckad.
The change of the name requires two over three majoritis in parliament.
The country's election Commissioner says there's no report on things that don't rule up for 1 pm.
However, the vote is 16 percent than 34 percent of parliament elections in 2016 after 66 percent of the voters registered voters to dump voted papers.
"I came to vote because of my children, where we were in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast lots of paper in Macedonia for the conversion of the country's name that would open the way to Macedonia to join the NATO and EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and laying chairs in front of the camp that were built by those who took the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and EU but we want to join him with pride and not by this way," said Kavadarkov.
"We are the poor people of the country but we have honor.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonian, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia's integration."
The Prime Minister Zaev said the raid in NATO will give enough investments to Macedonia where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
I believe the majority will receive because more than 80 percent of our people chose EU and NATO," said Zaev after throwing votes.
He said the decision 'yes' was a ‘ future shortage.'
A vote has been published on Mondays by the Macedonian Institute for the Police Research that says between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will take part in the choir - below the amount required.
Another vote, run by the Macedonia Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a sound punctuation successful the number of loners coming must be 50 percent plus a vote.
Failure in the sound punctuation will be considered the first serious slap to the pro-Barat government police since taking over in May last year.

Trump Assemblys in West Virginia
The President hasn't directly referred to the situation around the High Court chooses Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the interest of the number of Republicans that came in the mid-century election.
"All that we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important choice in our lives.
I don't fight but I'm very matching and that's because I'm in all places fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "You see this terrible democrat radical group, you see it's happening right now.
And they mean to retrieve power by using any means, you see cruelty, crime.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to break up for power and control; and what they want is power and control, we will not give it to them."
Democrat, he said, was on a mission to ‘ stop and stop.'
"And you saw it for four days ago," he said, calling Democrat "marah, evil and incorrect."
He's referring to Senator of the Justice Committee of Senator Democrat Dianne Feinstein by name, who has received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Are you blocking the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one-- that's the worst body language I've ever seen"
It's not a big church anymore.
To be honest, it is not tolerant of anyone who expresses their views
When the Moingm activist in the local party I voted to identify me, it didn't make a breakdown.
Anyway, I'm the latest in the AP Buruh line told that we weren't welcome-- all because of expressing our views.
My partner, Joan Ryan, received almost the same treatment because he supported anti-audi.
In my case, the prank movement has criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interests of the economic duty of police, about national security, about Europe, which is ironic that is almost the same issue as what Jeremy did not agree with the former leader.
The meeting notice for the Buruh Nottingham East party on Friday says that "we want a meeting that includes all and productive."
For nearly eight years I've been a local AP Buruh, the GC meeting on Friday night actually includes all of that.
So sad today, it's not tone for many meetings and political promises ‘be better, softer' have long been forgotten if, indeed, it's ever started.
It's becoming more real that the differences of views cannot be accepted in the Buruh party and each opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party's patch.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, as a fellow worker who was earlier, I thought that sharing the political views that were almost the same to begin expecting me to make U round and take a position that I wouldn't agree about national security or single EU market.
When I talk outside and don't care what I'm talking about, then it'll be followed by threats because of social abuse, no choice, consensus political stations, and get me out of the Buruh party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I am lucky more than my colleagues because they comment more about politics.
I was impressed by the attitude and pain of fellow workers who were bombarded by sexists and racism on their faces every day but never gave up.
One aspect of this era's political disappointment is how abuse level has become used to.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Buruh party develop cultural tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer the vast church and with every ‘ unbelievable' or change in the selection rules, the party is getting narrower.
I have received a lot of advice since two years ago urging me to be silent, not too prominent, and then I'll ‘ be good. ’
That's not what I wanted to do.
Since I was part of the Buruh 32 years ago as a school student, it was raised by thatcher's government abducted my entire class of grades, I've been trying to perform a better public service for those who really need to be a local party or a government minister.
I've never hid my politics, including my last elections.
No one in Nottingham East might be confused about my position and the intersection part with the patch now.
To those who support the subject on Friday, what I would like to say is that when the country refuses Brexit, it's going to be clear of our house, business and public service, I don't understand the feeling of waste and energy of my loyalty to the Buruh leader.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voter, whether member of the Buruh or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise the abortion not selected or political adjustment does not stop me from acting in what I trust is for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr who is unable to climb to the climax
Two slow attempts may make the final decision was overturned, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves a success in the charming Premiership Tennent match.
They're now on the top place in the table, the only one that has never lost from 10 people.
Finally, their superior defenses, as much as they used their opportunity, made the army of hosts and instructor Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested on our game so far, and we still can't be defeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Publish to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson tried in the 14th minute, conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, was issued for the resistance by Warriors, allowing Melrose to create networks and Jason Baggot to catch unchonversitic attempts.
Climo led Ayr with penalti, before, in half a time, he got the eyes and then tried a solo conversion to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started a second time well and Patrick Anderson's trial, confronted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five eyes.
There was a long delay because Ruaridh Knott, which was brought out, and from the beginning, Ayr went forward again through Stafford McDowall's experiment, conversing by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was later given yellow cards, and again, Melrose retaliated an additional player with no conversion of Bruce Colvine, at the end of the intense pressure.
The host's army came back, however, and when the Hutchinson Struth was given a yellow card because of Climo's tack without a ball, from the outside line of the penalti, MacPherson was a kid behind Ayr.
Conversing climo, as he did almost as it started, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box box David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's flanker far to try the five hosts.

'The link is ours': Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The navigator's naval headquarters in La Paz.
Common buildings spread the sea blue flags.
The navy base from Titicaca Lake to Amazon is tapped with a motto: 'Lautan is ours actually.
To get back is a responsibility."
Throughout Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of losing beach to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is clear - like a yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may be the highest in the century, since Bolivia is still waiting for the judicial decision of the International Court, on October 1, five years after the discussion.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly hopes for positive decisions," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Boliviaans would watch the ICJ decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court would agree to that Bolivia - after the centuries of Chile had been required to negotiate to give Bolivia a way out to the sea.
Evo Morales, native Bolivia president who faced controversy contests for the first year’s first show - is also a great deal of interest in the day’s decision.
"We're so close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some who believe that the court will not make decisions that side with Bolivia - and if it happens, it will change a little.
The United Nations corporation has no power to expand the area to Chile, and has established that it won't determine the decision for the probability of discussion.
Regarding ICJ's decision that will come out only after six months of the final argument heard shows the case "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, international law expert Chile.
And not to slow down Bolivia's basics again, for the four years, there may have been obstacles.
"It for the entrance to the sea has been taken by Bolivia's administration now," said Zárate.
The Morales rhetorical enemy has reduced the little Chilean mercy, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile at one time will continue to discuss, but it will be too difficult to have a conversation after this.
Both countries have not changed the duta since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivia representative of Hague, rejected ideas that made a court decision quickly.
The Monday will bring Bolivia's great compression to open a new era relationship with Chile and have the chance of "determining marriage for 139 years for good together," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of the famous American presidents - uses maritime issues as political assistance.
"Bolivia never gave up his right to get a straight path to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says the nuclear truce won't happen unless it believes in the U.S.
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country wouldn't perform their nuclear truce first if he didn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to carry out the promises made during the final assembly in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments appeared because the Secretary of the State of the A.S. Mike Pompeo seemed to be starting up a nuclear diplomacy that stopped over three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's an ongoing ‘ dream' and the A.S. opposition to the end of the Korean War will cause the North Korea to lose.
Washington was careful to agree with a declaration without Pyong who made an important action of the weapons.
Both Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump wanted a second congregation.
But there is a widespread doubt that Pyong who was serious about launching the weapons that were seen as the only way to guarantee the safety of his country.
Pompeo was planning to visit Pyongyang the next month for a setup of the second Kim-Trump Congregation.

The language skills are essential to global citizens
The private schools of Scotland keep record of the achievements of academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of brilliant exams, which reinforces by individuals and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, this school, represented by the Scotland Swasta School Society, tried to serve at the best level for their students and parents.
The private schools goal is to prepare their students to continue higher education, their choice career, and their place as global citizens.
As a schoolteacher that they can and do early school curriculums, we see modern language continues to be famous and the subject of choice is required in school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language of the language, it will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue it will go into his heart."
This is a strong warning that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build contact and trust with people of other countries.
From this year's exam decision, we can see that the language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduate rate in private schools.
Some 68 percent of the students who learn foreign language have higher grade A.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, indicates 72 percent of students get higher grades in the Mandarin, while 72 percent of them learn German, 69 percent of them learn French and 63 percent learn Spanish as well as A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills children and young people are not sure to need them in the future.
The language now, as an optional subject, is being held the same as the STEM subject (sains, technologies, engineering and mathematicals) in private school curriculums and elsewhere.
Suggested research by the UK Work and skills in 2014 found reasons for the employer's struggle to meet the vacuum, 17 percent associated with language deficiency.
Because these and other skills have served to prepare a young person for their future career.
With more potential jobs require language, this skill is vital in this global world.
Regardless of how a person chooses, learning a second language gives him great strength in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
Can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will put a person who has a lot of languages automatically in front of the competition.
According to the YouGov vote over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent should not speak in foreign language well enough for conversation, with French as only two percent spoken language, 15 percent.
This is the reason the investment in the language teaching is now important for children today.
Having a variety of languages, especially the country is building the economy, will complete the children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they are learning.
Bebrapa will focus on more classic modern languages; others will teach the English language when looking ahead in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child cares, there's usually a lot of language that can be chosen from in private schools, with a master force in that part.
The private schools of Scotland dedicated to provide a study environment that would prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
At this time, in the environment of global business, which languages continue to become important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as ‘ international communication skills. ’
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and wonder for young people in Scotland.
Il faut rather le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Swasta School of Scotland

But how many minutes he's going to play is not determined yet.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton at the Lakers official website.
Lakers Mike Trudell's author is saying that James might be playing in a limited minute.
Following this week’s early training, James was asked about his plan for six games schedules before the season of Lakers.
"I don't need a game before the season to prepare at my career level," he said.
When Trump Assemblys in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a fast meeting campaign tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five - scheduled Trumps, including a friendly stop in place including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation arrested for him to choose to fill the vacuum in the Federal Court, Trump proposes to reach the support of the midwive election will come because the Republicans are risky to lose Congress control when the vote was decided in the Nov month.
What time does Trump meet in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
The Trump meetings in Wheeling in West Virginia are scheduled on 7 nights.
You can watch the Trump meetings in West Virginia online through the stream directly in YouTube.
The Trump is likely to handle this week's trial for the prospective Brett Kavanaugh Federation Court, which becomes tense for the prosecution of sexual offenses with the expected Senate's undi arrest for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main target of this hasty meeting is to help the Republicans get momentum in the face of November elections.
So President Trump's campaign says five meetings in the next week is "stolen volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and develop the majority they have in the Senate and the Refuters' Council," according to Reuters.
"Congress's congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will go to as many countries within us to a busy campaign season," covens who didn't want to be named tell Reuters.
Scheduled in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, meetings tonight can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw out the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month ago, Trump has visited West Virginia, the country that he has been raised for over 40 percent of the eyes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate Senate of the West Virgin Republican Party, Patrick Morrisey, who is following it in elections.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey until the president needs to come to support him," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Piala Ryder 2018: The U.S. team showed courage to fight in making sure that hope is still on a separate fight on Sunday.
After three sides of the opposite match, the side match on Saturday afternoon is probably what Piala Ryder needs this time.
The swinging Momentum is the concept of a sport that is one creation but it's really trusted by a player, and more in the game like this.
So, where is it supposed to be the momentum now?
"They have an advantage of six eyes and now it's four eyes, so we bring a little momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth when he walked at the end of the day.
Europe must have had an advantage, four eyes in front of us with twelve more eyes to draw.
American player, as Spieth said, felt they had a little advantage and a sense of motivation, not only from Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each had three of four eyes.
Spieth exhibits a winged game from beginning to green area and became an example to another player.
The loudest noise is louder when he keeps running, doing an important stroke to put four eyes on when he and Thomas miss after two eyes.
His stroke blow gave them victory on the 15th hole was welcomed by the same cheer, which told you that he believed the American army was still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all there is for all these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
Just two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas since the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the Piala Ryder, which was unprovocable.
A couple of different fans from Europe are interesting, but they're moving four eyes of four, and they don't seem to make any mistake.
"Moniwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogi on Saturday evening, but they also avoided bogi on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This period and the way their supporters provide and show it is evidence that they are the players to be killed on Sundays, and there are no more popular players to block the possibility of European victory at sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
As good as both of them in different holes.
The conversation about the victory of the European army, however, is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia's work easier, hero four players this morning, when he was negotiated with Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes mixing the Spanish player and the Swedish player.
Still, on Sunday, there is no one who can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to be seen closer because the interaction between couples, the counsel given and not given and the strategy can change in an eye.
Europe plays better as a team so far and precedes far on the last day but this four session also shows the U.S. forces that were previously questioned by many sides, including local fans.
The European team has taken 10-6 to the last day of Piala Ryder.
Europe brought a comfortable advantage on the last day of Piala Ryder after riseing from the four balls and four players with a 10-6 eye to the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari forward with two victorys over Tiger Woods who are fighting to bring their victory in Le Golf National to four eyes.
The European team headed by Thomas Bjorn tried to keep the trophy captured in Hazeltine two years ago, mastering the wrong American army in the morning four balls, with a series of 3-1 eyes.
The U.S. army gives more competition in the game of four players, wins two fights, but cannot turn the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight eyes of 12 eyes in the single Sunday fight to keep that trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player who won the four consecutive eyes during his and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the end of the sensation week is the second couple to win four eyes of their opening four resistances in the history of Piala Ryder.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four ball games, they then defeated Woods and the American new player, Bryson Dechambeau in the fight of 5
Woods, who went through two tough fights on Saturdays, exhibiting brilliance but now has lost in 19 out of 29 balls and four players and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't play resting during a four-ball session, returned to compensation with Henrik Stenson in four players in the fight to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2
Europe was not lucky on a quiet and relaxed day in southwestern Paris.
The main championship winner three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became a saddle for America with two eyes on Saturday.
They won 2
Only two times in the history of Piala Ryder a team who's missing four eyes into a single match, even as Furyk's defendant champion only needs a series to maintain the trophy.
After occupying the second place for two days, the response on Sundays seemed to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says 'never' they're going to disarm their weapons willingly without trust
The North Korean Minister says the United Nations on Saturday, continuous partition has caused their deep insubordination to the United States and it's not possible that his country will volunteer nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World's Great Assembly of the world's age, North Korea had taken the "the important step" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, closing the site of nuclear tests and promising not to increase the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But anyway, we don't see any matching reactions from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in the safety of our country and in such a situation, we will not have to disarm our weapons in a hard way first."
Even though Ri warned against North Korea against Washington's opposition to the final "stop" approach where the North Korea will be rewarded because she took the step independently, it does seem important because she did not reject the volunteers as Pyong did in the past.
Ri referred to the fact that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump brought to the first final congregation between the president of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try to make “a nuclear safety of Korea's porch" while Trump assured the safety of North Korea.
North Korean attempts to end the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyong has to release his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow the recommendations to reinforce international partition over North Korea.
"Only asserting "concerning first" and increasing the pressure level within the partition to force their goals, and even against "the final declaration of war," said Ri.
"Except that the partition can weaken us is their empty dreams they don't recognize us.
But the problem is an ongoing partition that's getting worse in our unbelievable. "
Ri doesn't mention the plans for the second final finality between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader held in the United Nations court at the beginning of this week.
The minister just mentioned three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If only the end of this issue is South Korea and not the U.S., the end of nuclears from the island of Korea will not find a garden."
However, Ri's tone was dramatically different than last year, when he told the United Nations High Assembly that ordered the U.S. land with the North Korean rockets could not be avoided after "The Wicked President" Trump named Kim as a roket man in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations trial, Trump, last year, threatened to "resolve" North Korea, complimenting Kim for his courage in taking the steps to disarm the gun, but saying there's a lot of work still to be done and the restrictions have to continue until North Korea complete its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying, "If it took two years, three years or five--it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Secretary of the U.S.A. Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The government of the Security Council must continue in earnest and without fail until we experience the total nuclear suffix and confirmed.
The Security council has raised a voice to increase the partition over North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to unpack up nuclear missiles and Pyongyang balistics.
Pompeo meets Ri outside the United Nations Great Assembly and says after that he'll visit Pyongyang again in the next month to prepare the second-beast congregation.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July said that progress had been accomplished, only for North Korea in a few hours after it had condemned him for making "the order like gangster."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to expose the targets of missiles and nuclear complex if the United States took the "proper step."
He said Kim had told him that the same "two" Kim was looking for was a security guarantee promised by Trump in Singapore and headed toward a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard student has taken a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all his students more sleep in efforts to fight the culture of learning that has become more and more so through the caffeine all night.
A teacher force found students at the university number one world often couldn't understand the basics of self-control.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medical beds at Harvard Medical School, and an expert at the Brigham and Women Hospital, prepared a course that he believed would be the first to look like it in the United States.
He was inspired to start that course after giving a talk about a lack of sleep effect during the study.
'At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told about this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep-- and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course was introduced this year as a 12 - year - old, explaining to the students about good sleeping habits to help academic and sports achievements, and improving their well - being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatrists at Harvard Medical School and university health service executive directors, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding his students sleep less all week.
The course for an hour involved some interactive tasks.
In one part, there's an image of a board room, where the students clicked cups, langsirs, coaches and books to be told about caffeine and light effects and how performance sports are influenced by sleep shorts, and the importance of sleep routine.
In other parts, participants are told how long - term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know he won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know-- as you have the right to know the effects of health when you choose to smoke," plus Prof. Czeisler.
A proud culture in which to ‘ stay awake all night’ lives, ’ he says, adds, that modern technology and pressures that the student develops mean lack of sleep are only one problem growing.
Make sure you have enough sleep quality, it's supposed to be a 'secret weapon' a student to fight pressure, fatigue and concern, he said-- even to avoid getting weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a California student who studied chemistry and 19 - year - old physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to initiate his schooling last year in Harvard.
He said that course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop that course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hoped, was to ask all graduates to complete the same study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and after sleep, and to notice the effects of the 'bio lighting' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can ruin your rixma from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol I killed Gerrard boys
Rangers suffered another defeat in the opposing place when the Dolly Déls were tied up a weak team Steven Gerrard with 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was still looking for the first victory in the opposing place since the 4-1 February of St. Johnstone, but the force Gary Holt gave the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 fights to make his team miss eight eyes behind the pre-premiership liga Ladbrokes, Hearts.
Exploding at the seventh minute before the first half of the time and the Rangers seemed to have no idea to compare position.
With the Rangers now down to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third ladder and was just behind Hibernian with the difference.
And the Rangers may have faced another problem after the line guard, Calum Spence had to be treated for the injury of the head after the object from his team area.
Gerrard made eight exchanges to his team of close to half the end of Piala Betfred after defeating Ayr.
Holt kept the 11th team of Livi who stole one eye from Hearts last week and he must have been pleased with the way his team was worried about their opponent at all times.
Rangers may rule the game but Livingston did more tests on the goal.
They were supposed to squeeze a goal only after two minutes when the first touch I used to give the room to Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor gol, but the middle player was targeted.
The kicking out of the back of Jacobs Charge found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
Rangers successfully retrieving the rule but he lives just hope in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was supposed to be given a penalty kick in the thirty-five minute when he and Steven Lawless were conversing but the Judge Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers only gave two trials right in the first half of time but former Ibrox gol guard, the Kelly Liam is easy to resist Lassana Coulibaly's horn and the weak Ovie Ejaria football.
Even though Livi's opening goal in the34th minute might be against the game rent, no one can deny their chances.
Rangers again failed to react with Jacobs' offensive motion.
Scott Arfield was just stiff when Declan Gallagher tolerated the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly sent him to the contest for the easy end.
Gerrard made a exchange during the breaktime by changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost gave a quick impression when the wing player gave the ball to Morelos but the awesome Kelly went out of his area to block.
But Livingston continues to make the opposing team to play the game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sent a long sendout for a long delivery.
The Holts were supposed to widen the abyss in the final rounds but McGregor lived well to deny Jacobs before the Lithgow horn was exposed from a gol angle.
Rangers replacement player, Glenn Middleton pleaded another penalization when he was in contact with Jacobs but again Thomson ignored him.
Almanak: Creator Geiger
And now, the page from our "Day" Almanak: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and CHITING... the day where Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger will be born in Germany.
Geiger creates a method for detecting and measuring radioacticivity, a discovery that eventually leads to an device known as the Archiger.
As the main scientific basis ever since, the Kaunter Geiger became pop culturebone, such as in the "Bells of Coronado" film in 1950, which was stared by unconscious scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's the Geiger Wall, used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you use this ear font, you can actually hear the atom effects given by radioactivity in the mineral."
Yes, it sounds right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 6th birthday.
But the creation that brings his name remains eternal.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look at bad cells and kill them
Vacsin taught the immune system to identify evil cells as part of treatment
The method involved is extracting immun cells from the patient, changing them inside the lab
It can't look at a protein that normally happens to many cancer cells and then it's re-injected.
An experimented vaccine suggests a decision that affects patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize bad cells, recovering from her obsolete cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immun cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so they can "see" proteins common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our test shows that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "cause of some kind of cancer growth," including breast cancer, ovari, lungs and colorectals, obviously Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to take the immun cells from the patients and their "reaching" ways to eliminate cancer cells have been successful in caring for the kind of leukemia.
Canye West accompanied Pro-Trump Cercas, dressing the MAGA Hat, after his SNL Appearance.
It Not Accepted Well
Kanye West was ridiculed at the studio on Saturday Night Live after a great performance where he praised President A.S. Donald Trump and said he was going to be in 2020.
After presenting his third song that night entitled Ghost Town where he was wearing the hat 'Make America Great', he kept fighting Democrat and repeating his support for Trump.
"Many times I asked a white man and they said, "How can you be a Trump, he's a racist?"
This is how, if I'm worried about racism, I've moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with the sketches that Matt Damon stared in which Hollywood's star tracked Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Committee of the prosecution of the sexual attack made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it's not broadcasted, Kanye West's recordings are loaded up to social media by Chris Rock's player.
I don't know if Rock's trying to mock West with that shipment.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had a hard time behind the stage of his hat.
"They're circling me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're barking me!
Then they said, I'm in an important place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West adds: "You want to see that unimportant position?" saying that he's going to "to wear my superman coat, because this means you can't lead me.
Try love"
His comments invite the ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors seem ashamed, reports Variety, with one there tells the publishing: "Let the study be quiet."
West has been taken in as a substitute for the Grande Arian singer, where his ex-friend, Mac Miller's singer died a few days ago.
West is a surprise to many people with a song show I Love it, dressed as Botol Perrier.
The West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner who sent out the café: "To one of the most courageous insans: YOU've been given a VERIFICATION."
But by the hos of the bual interview, Karen Hunter says West is just "being himself and that's really great."
"But I chose not to reward someone (with buying his music or clothing or supporting his "seni" who I believed received and shared ideology that endangered my community.
He's free.
We too, "he added.
Before that presentation, the rap singer announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now known as "the one who was once known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed the footsteps of Diddy, who also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rap singer, Snoop Dogg has changed his name to Snoop Lion and certainly the song refers to legend music, Prince, who turned his name into symbols and then as an artist known as Prince.

Star Game of Thrones, Kit Harington raises maskulinity toksik
Kit Harington is known for the role of the sword hero as Jon Snow in a mid-HBO, middle-time fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, has raised the maco's stereotaip, mentioning its character playing on the screen means that young people often feel like they need to be strong for respect.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something' and questioned how to deal with the toxic maskulinity problem in the era #MeToo.
Kit, recently married with the Games of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he's very strong about handling the problem.
'I feel quite strong personally, at the present-- where's our wrong with maskulinity?' she said.
'What did we teach men when they grew up, from the matter we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculineity because of its very masculine character.
He added: 'What's natural and what's being taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes the boys think they need to be like this?
I think that is one of the most important questions we now have in mind, how do we change them?

HIV/Aids: China reported increase by 14% for new cases
China has announced the increase of 14% of the people who live with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials report that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases reported in the second tribe of 2018 only.
Most new cases have infected by sex, signaling changes that are not immediately addressed.
Normally, HIV spread fast through some parts of China because of the contaminated blood transfer.
But the number of those with HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, the Chinese health officer said it in Yunnan’s territory court.
Over the years, however, the number of HIV and AIDS serve people in China has increased as many as 100,000 people.
HIV service through sex is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBTs was said to be more and more.
Because of the conservative value of the country, research suggests that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of sickness is that result from poor sexual protection in connection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters refused his staff to block the GOP senator's data, raises the 'a dangerous lies' and the theory of conspiration'
The U.S. Representative of Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the charges of his staff who had exhibited personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia's law enforcement.
The Democratic of Los Angeles asserts that the demands have been spread by the ultra-right wings and websites.
"Worship, fraud and more bad fraud," said Waters in one fact in Twitter.
This information is reported to include the home address and phone number for the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcasted by strangers at Capitol Hill when the Senate panel heard a hearing of sexual accusations against the future Supreme Court of Brettt Kavanaugh.
The information leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report the IP address that identifies the source of sending from Waters's office and spread the Waters staff information, Hill says.
"It doesn't feel this is a fake and a lie," Waters said again.
"My hands -- where the identity, personal information, and his safety have been compromised because of this false accusation-- is absolutely unrelated to the leaking of this information.
The charges don't feel this is really false and a fraud."
Waters reality is quick to invite online criticism, including the former secretist of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This fidelity is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows him no sign of being a Congressman.
When someone's accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't fight.
They can't question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm."
Fleischer said in comparison of the Waters and Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the critics who looked too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a future member of the Republicans who fights Waters in midwitter’s elections, also expressing his opinion in Twitter.
"It's a great news that it's true," he's curious.
In fact, Waters said his office has informed "the authorities that are in charge of the law enforcement of this false charge.
"We'll make sure the perpetrators will be revealed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that could destroy and harm to any and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes review Again - a weak Rowan Atkinson rite
It's normal now to find the sign of Brexit in any new film with the British slang and it seems to be used to resurface Johnny English's actions-comedi - which started in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a joke about how bad we're going to be a new country export?
Whatever the case, English - speaking Johnny may be able to demoralize the situation for the second time. More than anything else, he is a comic creation designed for English - speaking mobs.
He's certainly a weird secret agent to fall the glouse in Clousau, a little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the theme Chariots of Fire on the London Olympic Opening Programme 2012.
He's also inspired from the adventurers and mysterious international spy agents, Rowan Atkinson who's ever seen in the now forgotten television advertising Barclaycard, leaving chaos after that.
There's a great time or two in JE's latest film.
I like Johnny English to approach a helicopter in middle-armed battle suit and a fan on his helmet.
Atkinson's meat for the physical comedy is being shown, but the jokes feel very weak and weird, especially the "serius" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now with sure offering food as their materials.
The crime felt as if it were highlighted for children than adults, and for me an accidental Johnny English mistake is not innovation and focused on the Atkinson movies in Bean.
The main premise is the Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A scooter of cyber has slipped into the British web web network, exposed the identity of all Britain’s agents in the field, and mengecewakaning agents who served as a very small member for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a proud prime minister who is struggling with political and unpopular breakdown: Emma Thompson gave the best of the side character of Teresa May but nothing good in that script for his character.
The consultant told her every active spy was compromised, and she had to call someone out of college.
And that means Johnny English himself, who's smoking and now works as a schoolteacher in some fancy places, but gives a bad lesson to be a secret agent: some good joke here, because English offers the discovery of such academy as School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for the emergency cover and rejoined with Bough's former maid, played back by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged with a submarine commander, a burning character brought by a rather damaging Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who are filming in the Secret Service of Your Highness Duli, were again acting in the character of the beautiful peacock woman Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic millionaire of technology that claims he can solve British computer problems: Jason Volta is evil and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their adventure with a small task: disguised as a waitress, burning fire and burning the French restaurant; the travelers smuggled themselves into the fancy Volta broadcasting ship; and the English generated chaos when he tried to use the Maya Realiti poise font to customize himself in the Volta house.
All the funny scenes were brought well for the last round, but because it looked friendly and it had a little taste like a child's television show about it.
It's a pretty simple movie.
And just like the other films Johnny English, I kept thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really suits his talent?
The Buruh Nafi party planned for the British to work four days a week but paid for five days.
The head of the Buruh Party, Jeremy Corbyn considered a radical plan that would see the Britains work four days in a week but paid for five days.
The party was reported to want the bosses of the company to channel the mosque made through the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
He will watch the staff enjoy the weekends for three days but still carry back the same pay.
The source says, the idea is 'according' with a party economic agenda and a plan to bring the country in favor of the workers.
Moving to work for four days a week supported by the Work Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A right source from the Buruh Party told The Sunday Times: 'The basic test was announced before the end of this year.
'It's not gonna happen all night but working for four days in a week is an inspiration that fits a party approach to balance economics and favors to employees and industrial strategy of the entire party.'
The Buruh party was not the first to support that idea, with the Green Party promised a four-day work week in the election campaign in 2017.
However, this inspiration is not supported by the Buruh Party completely.
A Buruh Participant spokeswoman said: 'Though work for four days isn't a party base and it's not considered by a party.'
Canselor Bayangan, John McDonnell used the Buruh trial last week by promoting his vision for socialis revolutions in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he wasrazing to take the power away from the 'marah without face' and 'scatut' in the utilities firm.
The plan of the shadow canselor also means that the current shareholders in the water company may not be able to re-re-re-re-repeat their shares because the Buruh government can make 'cool' for reasons they're considered guilty.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in the company's board and to create Inclusive Ownership Danes to hand over 10 percent of the private sector's equator's equator to the employees, which will receive annual dividens up £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minit" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI investigation in charge of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his final vote to the Supreme Court at least a week, and has raised the question whether the discovery of the bureau could affect the Republic senators to give their support.
In the interview that was broadcasted on Sunday, the press "60 Minit" Scott Pelley asked for the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham to find something that the FBI would cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy looks more open than his friends from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to attend that trial, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that charge came up, and said, 'Do you do it?'
He's strong, brazen, clear."
In any case, Graham's vote is already determined.
"I've already made a decision by the Brett Kavanaugh and it'll take heavy charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know about this: Brett persistently denying it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls can't confirm it.
It's 36 years.
Say it doesn't see any change."
What Does the Worldwide Citizens Do About Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the home of the World People's Party, yearly music events with great stars and the same great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the World Citizen Party will see tens of thousands of people gathered at the Central Park Sea to not just watch the presentations such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase the awareness of the real goal of the event ends the extreme poverty by 2030.
The World’s Citizen Department, which was started in 2012, is further from Project Global Poverty, an international support group intended to eliminate poverty by raising the number of active people against it.
To receive the free ticket of this event (unless you can pay a VIP ticket), this concert visitor needs to prepare some tasks, or "attack" like being a volunteer, sending e-mail to the world leader, making phone calls or any other meaningful way to help improve the awareness of their goal to eliminate poverty.
But how much more will achieving of the worldwide People's population for 12 more years go to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of giving a free concert is a sincere way to persuade people to demand an action, or just one more case of "clicktivism"-- makes someone think they've done something by simply signing a online coffin or by sending one pickup?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said they've encoded 19 million "saw" from his supporters, pressing movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped the world leaders to declare more than $37 billion worth of commitments that will bring changes to over 2,25 billion people by the year 2030.
In early 2018, the group had known 390 commitments and announcements that were devoid of their actions, and at least $10 billion of that amount had already been taken or already gathered.
The group also summarizes the known funding has affected almost 649 million people around the world.
Some important commissions include the distribution of the food power, a sharing between investors and the consensus in the UK to "help the children taste their potential fully", promised to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unequality diet on that negera after receiving more than 4,700 ciapans than Gobal Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, the penderma, the federal government and the Global Citizens like you, we can make this unbalanced social injustice one past history," said the Month of Tracey Ullman Consert in London in April 2018.
The group also says after receiving more than 5,000 calls for fixing diets for mothers and children, the government has made it necessary to finance a project, the Racing Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Answering one of the questions on the Lazim on his website that asked, "What makes you think we can end up with solid poverty?"
The Global Citizen has replyed: "This is a difficult path and will take some time-- sometimes we will be disappointed and despaired.
But just as movements demand public rights and antipartheids before, we will succeed, because when we work together we're gonna grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the same artists who also perform the show of this year in New York, which will be dedicated by Deborra-Le Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "speed" to prevent Russians from exporting oil - Secreter in the State
Washington could be "if necessary" using his Navy to prevent Russia from selling oil on the markets, including in the Middle East, said the Secretary in the U.S. State Ryan Zinke according to Washington Examiner's report.
Zinke claims to have the Syrian banner involved their invitations to the Syrian government to find new oil markets.
"I believe their presence in Central Tmur is to master the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there's a way to handle this issue.
"The Americans have the ability, with our Navy, to make sure the seaway is open, and if necessary, to prevent their oil from being driven," he said.
Zinke said so when making a speech at a Consumer Energy Alliance, a group is not based on profits that refer to the U.S. users.
He also compared Washington to Russia and Iran, and he emphasized the same action.
"Options from the economy over Iran and Russia are somewhat similar, affecting and replaceing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no choice and with his economies so depending on oil.
This fact was issued when Trump's administration was on missions to increase the report of gas into Europe that was much cheaper to European users, in place of Russia.
Because of that, Trump's officers, including President of the U.S., Donald Trump himself tried to seduce the German country to withdraw from the Stream Nord pipe project 2 which was "go on the other side", which said Trump would make Berlin a consecrated by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the Nord Stream pipeline project of $11 billion that would mark an existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and it's just an economic project.
The Kremlin refuted Washington that was so strong that this project reproduces is because of economics and is an unfair example of competition.
"I'm sure we get that energy supply cannot be made weapons to press and users need to be free to choose." said Russian Power Minister Aleksand Novak following a meeting with the U.S. Secretary Secretary, Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. action has invited an unsatisfactory German country, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main industry in Germany, the German Industrial Federation Association (BDI), has requested that the U.S. bent into the EU's energy base and also on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there's third country that interferes with the supply of our country's energy." said Dieter Kempf head of the German Industrial Association (BDI) recently after the meeting between German Canselor Angela Merkel and President Russia, Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "fire cook" to meet as President at 2020, said Senator Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts said on Saturday that he was going to "fix-core" before he became the next president of the middle-growing election.
When the answer is open with the inhabitants of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren says he will consider to compete.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix the government breaks us up and this includes by putting a woman on her punch," he said the The Hill report.
"After 6 November, I'll think about the seconds to be the president's candidate."
Warren expressed his fear of President Donald Trump when the answer was open, saying that Trump's driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump was doing to our democracy," he said.
The Warrens are so loudly critical of Trump for calling Brett Kavanaugh's Brevanaugh's prosecution.
In one second on Friday, Warren said, "We must've needed an FBI investigation before the vote was made."
However, greeting a survey on Thursday shows the majority of the population in the region represented by Warren felt that Warren was not to be matched in 2020.
Fifty-four percent of "bakal" loners in Massachusetts say that the senator should not match, according to the survey of the Politic Research Center University Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support him at the game.
The survey also shows more support to former Governor Deval Patrick to compete, with 38 percent supporting him potentially to compete and 48 percent disagree.
The name of other highly proficient Democratics also discussed as the potential to fight in 2020 was former President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he'd decide officially before January, according to the Associated Press report.

The U.S. U.S. dakwa's claim was ‘ bleeding' with propaganda'
A week after a official Chinese newspaper broadcasting a four - page newspaper for details of the good with the trade between the United States - China, the U.S. Duta went to China and accused China of using a United States newspaper to spread propaganda.
President US Donald Trump on the last Wednesday refers to a 14th Chinese press advertising in the Des Moines Register newspapers that most sell in the country of Iowa - after accused the Chinese country of trying to interfere with congressing elections on November 6th, an accusation denied China.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections explained what the U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to press the country of China.
Being a common practice for foreign government broadcasting advertisements to promote trades, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a worse trade war with each of them wearing tarifes on their imports.
The early Chinese action in this trade war is to target exporters in such countries as Iowa who support the Republican Party represented by Trump, says the Chinese and U.S. states
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassadors to China and former governors Iowa, the largest agricultural exporter to China says that the Beijng step has harassed many employees, farmers and American businesses.
China, according to Branstad in one newspaper room in Des Moines Register on Sunday, wrote, "Now it's better to broadcast propoganda advertisement in our own free press.
"In broadcasting this propoganda, the Chinese government receives the freedom that the Americans practice, a tradition that centers on freedom of voice and freedom of newspapers," wrote Branstad.
"In fact, in the newspaper in Beijing, very less arbitrary voice and you can't see the real view of the people of the economic economy of China's country economies that disturbs because their media is controlled by the Communist Parti of China," he wrote.
He also added "one of the major newspapers in the Chinese country avoid offers to publish" his article, even though he didn't state which one.
The Republican Recepting Women’s Beauty Near the Middle Weeks of Story Kavanaugh, Warning by the Analysts
Even though many prominent Republicans support and support the Brett Kavanaugh candidates of the Affliant Court facing the charges of sexual harassment, analysts have warned them to invite reactions particularly from women, in the coming middle elections.
The tall emotions of this story and most of the Republicans say they're going to continue with the vote.
These things can't be changed," said Grant Reeher, a political professor of the Maxwell Center, the University of Syracuse in an article published on Saturday in the newspaper The Hill.
Reeher isn't sure that Senator Jeff Flake's step to force the FBI to start the investigation is enough to shut down the angry voters.
"You women won't forget what happened yesterday-- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, right advisers and national consultants for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On the Friday morning, the feeling indicator of "November will come!" when pointing to the feeling of the Senat Building when the Republicans who own the Justice Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh caliphs even with a testimoni from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democratic and motivated will explode," said Stu Rothenberg a political analyst free to the news site.
"The people say this thing too high; right.
This thing may be higher particularly for the women's voters who will vote from the outskirts and young voters, 18-29 years, these people don't like the president and rarely vote.
Before the public Ford testimonies that confirm the charges of sexual attacks against him by the candidate Court of Association, the analysts assumed that it would happen if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This has been a very complicated thing for GOP," said Micheal Steela, former director of the Republican Committee, early last week, according to NBC news.
"This is not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds into a federal judge, this is also about the way the Republicans wingani problem and the way they treat him," said Guy Cecil Director Priorities USA a group that helped select the Democrats to the news.
However, Americans seem to be divided to two and don't know who to believe in Ford's testimonies and Kavanaugh by half side to Ford.
YouGov's latest review shows 41 percent say they're going to believe or maybe believe in Ford testimonies, while 35 percent say they believe or maybe they believe Kavanaugh.
While 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or must be lying in his testimoni, while only 30 percent were talking the same about Ford.
After being pressed by Flake, the FBI now investigates the charges made by Ford and also at least another accusation, reports Deborah Ramirez, newspaper The Guardian.
Last week Ford made a confession of swearing in front of the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh brought him up in drunk when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said that the candidate Court of the Federation also showed his disability in front of Ford when a party he was in charge of Yale's University in the 1980s.

The Creator of the World Web Page, the Berners-Lee's team launchs the starting company to compare Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses an open source based on Solid's software of Berner-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will have the right to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernes-Lee's real joke purpose is "to master the world."
"We have to do this now," he said about this start company.
"It's a historic moment."

Bernard Vann: First World War Crus Recipient priest is commemorated
The only priest from the Church of England who received Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been divorced in the country after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Paderi Trued Vann received this gift on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a hendap shooter four days later and didn't even know he ever knew he had been given the highest gift of the British army.
A memorial stone has been set up and opened the curtain by his two grandsons in a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann said this is a glorious symbolic because the stone will be opened for a 100-year curtain from his grandfather's brave act.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his batallion across the Lean de Saint-Quentin's "full of thick foam and through a great mess attack."
Then he squeezed to the border and with the "epical vice" and precautions before launching using a gun alone and shooting three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Micheal Vann, 72 said his grandfather's action "something I can't repeat and so excited."
He and his sister Dr. James Vann also put a flower browse after the boiling headed by the Belia Brentwood Imperial Pancaragam.
Micheal Vann said "thanks are highly respected to be the same in this noise" and also added "true friendship with the support given by so many people."
The MMA fighter stays awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they're given Pig Peppa
Just imagine, you're awake all night to watch Bellator 206 but disappointed from watching the main show.
San Jose's list of 13 contests, including six main matchs that will be shown directly each night at the UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to join, the audience in the UK was stared when broadcast turned to the Pig Peppa.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch this match.
One of the fans says the exchange to the child's cartoon channel "a joke that doesn't tolerate" through the feed.
"The rule of the government shows a broadcast at 6:00 a.m. not suitable for the match by that they have to broadcast broadcast for children," said Dave Schwartz, the right team of the marketing president and Bellator communications when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Khinzir," yes."
President of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that the UK audience could watch it.
"I think, when I talk back on the broadcast, I think we can do something," said Coker.
'But 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, there's no way we can do anything until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcasts were exchanged a lot of repetition text and it's not good to hear.
We're trying to deal with this, we think this is a technical problem.
But it's not, it's more to the issue related to the government.
I promise you this thing won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five matchs instead of six - as usual-- and we're trying to do something that's impossible for the fans.
This is a poor situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "lowly" to sexuality
Tom Daley's Olympic speaker said he grew up with low feelings of self because of sexuality himself - but that's what became the motivation for his success.
He, 24 years old, didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he was talking about the gay right to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after Dad's victories, he wasn't so concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The customers remain in plans that have long been broadcasted, Kris Young's vacation for a few months of illness.
His sincerity suddenly in Laverne's first plan, Daley says he feels "slow than" his peers when he grows up because "he's not socially accepted as a man or a woman."
He said: "A little day, feelings less than anyone else and feelings differ from others are things that have motivated me and gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they got to know about his sexuality.
The winner of the Olypik Olympics two times now is a high proficiency for the LBGT class and has used its appearance at the Comanwel Sukan this year so that more countries don't make homosexuality a crime.
He said he's talking like this because he's lucky to be able to live openly without any problem and want to give "hope" to others like him.
The world's champion three times this said a fall in love with a man - a U.S. filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "undetermined"
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said, they never had a issue.
"When you're through so many experiences in so young age"-- she joined the first Olympic sport when she was 14 years old and her father died because of cancer three years later-- she said it was very difficult to meet someone in this link of age which passed through the same challenge.
This couple became father in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley say "all prespective" of his life has now changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"There's actually something more than the gold medals of Olympics.
The gold medal of my Olympic sport is Robbie."
His son's name was his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said he didn't want to accept the reality that he was going to die and one of the last thing he asked was that their ticket to London 2012 was purchased because he wanted to sit in front of once.
"I don't get heart to say 'You'll never be there to sit in front'." He said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my father stopped breathing and was already valid, I realized that my father wouldn't live forever."
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the copper medal.
"I realized this is what I dreamed of all my life--to jump in front of my fans in my own country in Sukan Olympics, no other notice can compare this," he said.
It was also the source of his first choice of song - "Proud" by Heather Small - who was collaborating with him during his preparation for Olympics and still made his roma feathers over.

Mickelson isn't so ready to face Piala Ryder on Saturday, it's gonna be up.
The American player Phil Mickelson will create a new record on this Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Piala Ryder game, but he needs to be ready to reclaim the game performance so that it doesn't end with the wish.
Mickelson who will play in this yearly event for a 12-time record, has been advised by Captain Jim Furyk for the game "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
It's like the habit of the United States, the winner of this five main competition spends time with being a witch and practicing with the hopes of improving the game.
One who can't hit the ball straight even when it's at the turn of his game, this 48-year-old player is not the right option for the golf Le Golf National field, where it's so far away that it's difficult for a hit that doesn't match.
And if this golf field just makes it possible, Mickelson is in the ninth game on this Sunday will be connected with the British Open winner, Francesco Molinari who has joined the new immigrant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four this week.
If the American player, missing four eyes starts with 12 games per-one, starts with fierceness, then the game of Mickelson must be very important.
Furyk was so sure of his players, that's all he could say.
"He understood his role today, and he slapped his shoulder and put his hands on my shoulder and said he'd be ready by tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-religious confidence is very high.
He's been well - known and has contributed a lot to this team for a long time, and this week.
I may not imagine that he'll play in two games.
I imagine more than that, but that's how and how we think we have to do.
He wants to be the same, like everyone.
Mickelson will handle Nick Faldo's record for the most occurrence of the Ryder Piala on this Sunday.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Piala who has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson wins 18 times, loses 20 times and seven serials, though Furyk says his presence brings an injection to his team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, like wearing people and it's fun if he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players have fun with her, this week, and the fun of seeing her.
He's not just playing but more than that.
Captain of the European army Thomas Bjorn knows their predecessor will be gone slowly.
Captain of the European army, Thomas Bjorn, knows from his experience that a distant position that belongs to will be lost in the last day of Piala Ryder and make things worse.
The Danish player first joined the 1997 game in Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captains and preceded the American team with five eyes but only could win with a very thin one with the count of 141.
"You keep reminding yourself after the predecessing position in Valderrama; we also get the predecessor position in Brookline but we lose and in Valderram we win, but win thins," said Bjorn after seeing the 2018 class wins 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be in front of the eye of 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in that team that this game is not over yet.
We're fighting out tomorrow.
Get out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
This hasn't ended until the eye hasn't been raised and it's on the circumference board.
We have the goal of repetitioning this trophy, and we'll focus on this goal.
I told you, I'm gonna focus on 12 players in our team, but we're all supposed to realize who our opponent is -- they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy for the accomplishment of his men in the golf field that was so difficult, Bjorn added: "I can't be able to make it.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow a person's accomplishments have to be cool and that's something different to do.
Great thing to be out there with a friend and when everything goes well, but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golf player will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give you the best in you tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give his best in himself too."
Contrary to the Bjorn view, his opponent Jim Furyk would hope that his player would play well as a individual player instead of a pairing event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had found three eyes out of four eyes.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day of the change of position, while in the army that was winning in Brookline before the defeat of the Europeans when they did "Glory in Medinah."
"I remember every word broken," he said when answering a question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more tomorrow events, but if you all want to start as fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When the momentum starts, it'll pressure the show in the middle.
We're going to set up our player in a way that we think is appropriate, we're gonna try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned back and confiscated with Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter of the European player at the top part.
"I'm doing this rule because I think it's going to be true and all of it," said Bjorn regarding individual player choice.
The new German warship is delayed again
The German Navy should receive his latest refrigerators in 2014 to replace the warship of the Cold War, but the ship will not be ready until the next year for the increase of the system and costs, according to the local media report.
The "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the name of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fried now has been suspended until the first half in 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit who picked a military spokesman.
This warship was meant to be part of the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the fate of the great project.
Four warships Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fried by the Navy in 2007 will replace Bremen-class fries.
It's understood, it's going to contain characteristics like high-powered cannon, multiplication anticapal complete and anticapals and some of the characteristics of affinity such as reducing detection by radar, red lights and aatomic capabilities.
Other important features are a longer period of time - this new frequencies must be able to sail up two years than their bases.
However, various obstacles indicate that this advanced battleship, which is thought to be capable of highlighting the German power of a foreign country, would miss out on the date that it would serve in the Navy Services, according to Die Zeit
This poorly lucky F125 was a headline last year, when German Navy officials didn't want to monitor the warship in and send it back to the construction company of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to its builder after the shipping.
Not much to know why the ship was returned, but the German newspapers called some "fiery and device" damage made this ship of war useless if sent for battle missions.
The damage to software needs to be taken heavy because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be controlled by just 120 classes - half of what it takes to control old Bremen class fries.
It's also the thing where this warship is too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any future increase.
The warship "Rheinland-Pfalz" 7,000 is believed to be twice as heavy as a warship in the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the price of the whole project - including training for classes - is also issues.
Project is said to have reached
The problem that hits the latest fridge warship reveals how missing the German Navy is.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chief of defense committees in parliament, admitted the Navy had to face a lack of battleships that could be moved.
The officer also said the issue was getting worse, because an old warship that had been stopped did not get a replacement ship.
He complains that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship can join the Navy.
National Trust covers the life of the bats.
Recent research being carried out in a Scotland’s highest estets was designed to explain why bats use earth’s shapes to hunt food.
Hopefully this study will bring to the latest discoveries of the unique mammals who are trying to fly this and can be a guide for the restoration activities.
The research by scientists at National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual bats, and the soprano cheekstrelles and the brown bats are long and the Daubenton roses in the Inverwester Park of Ross.
The special recording tool will be placed in certain locations around the treasure to track the bat activity of the entire season.
NHS and volunteer workers will also make a relocation in use of mobile drying devices.
The character analyzes the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of every type of bats and spices and these bats.
A map of habitats and reports will be produced to create a picture of the earth's face on the behavior of bats.
Rob Dewar, the airline adviser to NTS, hopefully this research results will indicate the most important habitat area to the bats and the way it is used by every species of bats.
This information will help to identify the benefits of the management of the habitat such as making a varieties and the best way to maintain the forest for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and UK has decreased a lot in the past century.
The bats were threatened by buildings and construction work that disrupted the bats and lost habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also risks to bats are the same as flies papers and some chemicals used to care for building materials and pet cat attacks.
The bat's actually not blind.
Because of a bat hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques using sound to identify insects and obstacles in flights.
NTS responsible to care for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the country are extremely concerned about bats.
They have ten trained experts who often run surveys, check places of up and sometimes save the bats.
The organization also founded the first center of refuge in Scotland in Threave estet in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
David Thompson's estet manager said this estet is the most suitable place for the bats.
"In Thereave we have a very suitable place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many big trees and suitable habitats.
A lot more we don't know about bats, so the work we run here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and expand.
He emphasizes how important it is to run a check before starting the maintenance of the estate because there is an accidental possibility that we can destroy the bat nest that will contain bats that can kill 400 bats and bats, and maybe destroy the entire population of local bats.
The bat is protected and is a mistake to kill, to harass or interrupt or destroy the nested bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer for Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
He said: "There's still a lot of things we need to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how they grow."
Ronaldo denounced the accusation of rape while his lawyer was ready to record the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the accusation of rape over himself as "false news" and said that someone wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer would hold out the German magazine, Der Spiegel, who published this accusation.
The president of Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Then he was said to have paid $375,000 to close the victim's mouth according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in the Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the accusation was reported, Ronaldo 33 years condemned this report as "false news."
"Not true.
What they say today is false news," said the winner of 5 Ballon d'Or's gift to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, this is part of my job.
I was a happy man and everything was so nice, ” said the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are getting ready to check De Spiegel on this charge, which they call "a unfeeling report and disturbing private space," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz lawyer said that the player would take a change for "the moral abuse that directly disrupts his personality, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights resin ever since a few years."
This incident was reported on in June 2009 in a fancy hotel Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported to return to that player hotel, where he was accused of taking care of the woman untrue, according to the papers registered in the Clark District of Nevada.
Majorga claimed after the incident that the player kneeled in front of him and said he was "99 percent" was a "good man" and was only a single percent.
The document confirmed Ronaldo as having sex, but on the basis it was fond of.
Majorga also claimed him to do a police report and take a picture of the injury that happened when he was in the hospital, but then agreed to settle it outside the court because he was "conscious of reactions" and was afraid of being "abandoned by the public."
That 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous solution because she's still traumatized with what happened.
Ronaldo nearly joined Real Madrid from Manchester at the time of the charge, and in this summer he moved to the Italian football giant Juve for $100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will ever regret 'for the loss of the train
UK "will regret forever" if the status of the world's leader in the production of a car after Brexit, says the Secretary of Trade Greg Clark.
He's also adding this some kind of fun because Toyota UK tells BBC if Britain leaves the European Union without solution, it's gonna stop the production of her abandoned car in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car driver said the effect of this would have caused a shipping problem at the border if there was no solution for Brexit and this would have resulted in the loss of a job.
Factory of Burnaston - who issued the Toyota Auris and Avensics - set up nearly 150,000 train units last year, 90% of them exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view that Britain comes out of the European Union without any solution at the end of March, we'll stop the production of our car in the factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's business in Burnaston.
Some other car owners in UK include, Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover were also saying their concerns if the UK came out of Europe without a solution to the way the rented trade of the border would work.
For example, BMW said they'd close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car drivers is about the risk of the rescuing network if Brexit is unresolved.
Toyota's car evacuation depends on the installation base of the supply receiving at the right time without being kept with car parts brought in to factory every 37 minutes from all over the UK and the European Union for the packed cars.
If the UK comes out of the European Union without any solution on March 29, it's most likely to be a discomfort at the border that the industrialists predicted would have been delayed and lack of replacement.
Toyota can't keep the inventory supply over a day at the Derbyshire factory, says the company on, then the release will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the plans for the future Minister Theresa May regarding a two-way approach to the European Union "to do well to avoid any checking at the border."
"We need one solution, we want a solution that will enable not only a success for the present but for us to taste this opportunity," said he to BBC in Radio 4's Today programme plan.
"The book is not only from Toyota but also this other issuer shows that we must continue this very successful reproductive network
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but for a long time warning will increase the cost and reduce the factory's saing and the next will result in the loss of a job.
Peter Tsouvallaris who's been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a worker member who is responsible for the union management at this factory, said the members are already starting to be disturbed: "Obey my experience, the missing work will not return.
A government spokeswoman said: "We have prepared a good and firm plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
The Frum meeting with Rosenstein might be delayed again, said the White House.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein's championship team may be "removed to the next week" because of the interest in Brettt Kavanaugh's proposition as an ongoing federal court candidate, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein who's overseeing the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller's involvement in Russian elections, the connection between Trump's assistants and Russia and the possibility of preventing justice from the President.
Whether Trump's gonna fire the prosecution team or not and then defy Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become the most warm gossip in Washington.
Early this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein's plan to use a secret tape to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president with a 25-convert.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last Monday, he went to the White House, behind the report that he said he'd resign.
Instead, it was announced a meeting on Thursday with the Trump that was at the time of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was not willing to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid it to join Kavanaugh confession and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh to hit him, in front of the Senat's spirit committee, both of whom they gave a confession.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to commit a week's investigation on the charge of Kavanaugh, this has delayed the full vote at the Senate.
Secretary newspaper Trump, Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "Date is not set yet, perhaps in this week, I think it might be suspended a week again as some of the things that are happening in the federal court.
We'll see later and I'll always give the press the latest information.
Some of the preachers will make such a point: Sanders have never held any white House newspaper since September 10th.
When his host was, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't have a lot of newspapers, not because he didn't like the TVist who was trying to look for "conscious" but he also said, "I don't agree because they really want attention."
Then he said the connection between the press and the Trump will grow.
"Presiden has held the most question - than the president-preciden before him," he said without giving any evidence. "We've made a calculation."
The newspaper congregation will be held, says Sanders, but if the newspapers have a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've been doing so much since this last week's dirt and this will replace the newspaper conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers newspaper questions when traveling out of the White House or when participating in an open - answer session or when the news congregation is present with an honored guest.
The media congregation alone is very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made free and strange appearances in front of the preachers who gathered.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the European Union in NHS about their concerns with Brexit
The Secretary of Disappointment has written a letter to all the workers from the European Union who are working at the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will continue here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter of time less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scotland government has already signed up to pay for the petition for the European Union citizens who work in their public sectors.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiation between the UK and the European Union of releasing has continued, and it leads toward a decision at the end of the fall.
But the U.S. government has improved in preparation to face a single scenario without a solution.
I know this is something very worried about you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate each of you's contributions, regardless of your citizenship.
Workmates from all over the European Union and other countries, carry with many experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is your place and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Runs the Emergency Surgery After Surgery Head injuries
The Tennessee defense player State Tigers Christion Abercrombie went through an emergency surgery after losing 31-27 with Vanderbilbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessean.
The coach Rod Reed told those injured preachers that attack shortly before the second time.
"He's close to the sideline and suddenly collapses there," said Reed.
Coach and health officials give Abercrombie oxygen there before putting her in a discomfort and take her for further treatment.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had finished surgery at Vanderbilt Medicine Center.
Harris's adding "no information about the type/a long way of injury at this time" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury happens.
Abercrombie, the first year of the red dress, played in the first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He's done five ass on Saturday before he's out of the game, the number of it in this season is 18.
A foreign buyer will be taken a higher duti setem when they buy property in UK
A foreign buyer will be taken a higher duti setem when they buy real estates in UK and this money mass will be used to help the gelandage under the latest Tory plan.
This step will cause Corbyn's success to pull young voters.
The Duty of these are going to be UK on those who don't pay taxes.
Storms are expected to quote up to £120 million a year - to help the landing
A foreign buyer will be taken by a higher duti of a setem when they buy a treasure in the UK - money will be used to help out, says Theresa May today.
This step seems to be to show Jeremy Corbyn the success of pulling young votes with promise to provide a potential housing and to make a person who thinks that he's a great target.
The bill of this black will be placed on individuals and firms who don't pay taxes in UK, and the money from these results will help the government to deal with the problem of the person who has no accommodations.
This is an addition to the dute that has already been taken, including the higher duti that was introduced two years ago on the second house and the house bought for renting that might be three percent.
The treasures are expected to be able to collect up to £120 million a year through this step.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new estates are bought by non-UK citizens, causing the price to rise and make fun of those who want to buy their first house.
Most luxurious areas - especially in the capital - have become "standing alone" because many of their owners are foreign citizens owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
This new foundation was announced a few weeks after Boris Johson demanded that the duti setem be reduced to make room for more young people to buy their first house.
He accused a huge construction company deliberately to maintain a high price by buying land but not waking it up, and baking Mrs. May to wipe the coot into the house that was capable of to deal with Britain's "depressive housing" troubles.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing renovations, including rent control and evaporating the exorcism.
He also wants more power given to the council members to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: "Then I said I'm going to dedicate my period to the prime minister to return the British dream-- this life must be better for every next generation.
And that means fixing our bad housing markets.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to stay, work and build life here.
However, it's unfair because it's easy for people who don't live in UK, and foreign companies to buy houses over the British who work hard here.
For too many, the dream of having a house of their own is a very remote one, and the reality of living everywhere is that of humiliation.
Jack Ross: ‘ My main goal is to manage Scotland'
The Sunderland Jack Rosa said his main goal is to be the Scotland manager one time.
Those 42-year-old Skotlands were looking forward to the challenge of revising the North-East club on the third stairwell in the League One, less than three eyes from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Skotlands League last time.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for B cap and so far," said Ross to BBC Scotland Sportsund.
"I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and there was something that always attracted me there.
That chance will just come, if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross's replacements as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo in Canio.
The ex-Athetic manager Alloa Athetic said he didn't feel like a brand of name that was so famous in the big clubs, because he had previously rejected the proposal of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me the meaning of success at this moment is 'can I bring this club back into the Dance League?
Because the structure and facility that are in this club, it should be in the League of Perdana," he said.
"It's not easy to reach, but I'm going to assume I'm successful if I can return this club to the Prime League."
Ross was just three years in the management field, after being a manager in Dumbarton and being one of the trainers in Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back to level three after being lowered and changed the fate of St Mirren from being sent down position to the Champion next season.
And Ross said he's very comfortable now than being a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalls, when he manages Alloa.
"I know the management field really matchs me, rather than play.
Maybe it's weird because I'm successful, I can live happily and enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing is a little difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I'm still going through it from the pressure and the pressure on my role as a player but it's more comfortable as my manager.
I've always wanted to take care and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something that I like all my adult life."

The right time to drink beer is 5.30pm on Saturday, according to research.
This summer heat wave brings tuah to Britain's pubs that are in trouble but the distrusted restaurant is under pressure.
Groups of pubs and bars indicate the increase of sales by 2.7 percent in July - but in the restaurant it's down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business negotiation firm that collects these numbers, says: "The continuous hothouse and the longer British World Piala campaign means that July will follow the pattern of June, where the pubs rise 2.8 percent, unless the restaurant falls worse.
The 1.8 percent of the business in the restaurant in June's month was getting worse in July.
The pub deficiency that takes priority in drinking and bars is very strong than the lowest restaurants.
Pubs that prefer for food also suffer bad consequences from the hot weather, but it is not as bad as restaurant handlers.
It seems that most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pub-pub and bar record the increase of the sales by 6,6 percent for that month, while food is down 3 percent.
Paul Newman analyst of entertainment and food from the RSM says: "This decision seems to have been the same and continuous since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sports events are still a major factor in the marketing of sales.
Doesn't surprise the restaurant group continues to be circumference, the sales down 4,8 percent if the comparison of the year must be worse than the costs.
A long summer weather hit the restaurant handler in a bad time and only time will determine if it's colder like we're going to be in August. "
The number of sales in the pubs and restaurants, including the new opens, 2.7 percent in this July show the humidity in the brands that have just been introduced.

Mother's milk pumping accounts that make comparisons with cows carry an online conflicting opinion
A mother’s issue issue of various conflicted opinions was dealt with online at a company because of advertisements that a mother nurses compared her to a cow that is milked for milk.
To launch what is said "the mother's quiet and can use the first in the world" technological company Elvie releases a music video in the form of a joke to show the freedom that mothers can feel about using this new pump.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn filled with creepy to the song where the lyrics say: "Yes, I'm paming milk itself, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize this isn't puting, it's my chest."
The Korus is: "Pam out, pam out, I'm sucking kids, pam out, pam out, I'm pam out, I'm pumping my chest."
However, this advertisement published on this landmark site has caused online controversial.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, this video has invited a variety of reactions from common, many people say that it gives a bright picture of the tenusu industries that "common".
"A wrong decision to use cows to raise this product.
Just like us, cows need to bunting and have to give birth to milk, but unfortunately the cows are disseminated from the mother's mother in a few days they were born," said a writer.

Another comment: "A trauma for the cows and the calf.
"But what's the word that they use to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children"?
Another adds: "A commercial that doesn't have to hit directly."
Other people defend the ads, with a woman confessing that she found the song "that's a shame."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still give the body milk.
Smoking makes me feel like a cow.
It was crazy, but I thought it would be like it to be displayed.
This is a genius product," a writing.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement directed to a mother who packed at the place of work or at the rest of the toilet."
It's not an ad to commend or judge the tenusu industry."
At the end of the video, a bunch of women exposed that they've all been dancing with a pam hidden in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the resembling that most women who packed milk say they feel like a cow.
However, Pam Elvie is really silent, no wires or tubes and can be loaded hidden in the clothes in the order, give women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and also get out when pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is a product that is so revolutionary, he should have received a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who are pumping with milk cows, we want to put the packing of the body and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, showing a way that comforts and interacts with freedom feelings through a new pam use.
This is not the first time Elvie's pam became a headline.
On a London fashion Sunday, a mother of two children appeared on the platform for Marta Jakubowski designer while using the product.
Hundreds of Kanaks Transfer With Silence to Khemah Champion at Texas Borders
The number of migrants held up despite the unchangeable monthly border transfers, due to the rhetorical and heavy base known by the Comp, making children's place with the curtain harder.
According to tradition, the loans are un documented immigrants, and they're afraid to endanger their position to stay in the country if they take a child.
The risk rose in June, when the federal authorities announced that the future security and other adults in the family had to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigrational authorities.
In the last week, Matthew Albence, right employees Imgressen and Castam Power, gave a statement in front of Congress that the agency had held back the dozens of individuals who had begged to be loans to unguarded children.
The agencies validate 70 percent of the prisoners not having a previous criminal record.
"Over 80 percent of the person who is either a loaner or a family member, is here illegally here and most of them are immigrants without permission.
That way, we're going to keep hunting the person," Albence said.
In order to process children faster, the authorities recognize new rules that require some of them to attend court within a month's arrest, not after 60 days according to the predecessor, according to the protection workers.
Many would attend by telephone to congregation meetings, not by personal attendance, but to appeal to their case in behalf of immigration judges.
Those who are considered unworthy for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the child's under custody, they'll be more likely to get anxious or depressed, and this will lead to stimulating action or attempts to escape, following protective officers and following reports that the system has been issued in a few months ago.
The arson says that the concern is higher in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the signs that children struggle with feelings may not be detected, because the size of the place.
They add that by moving children to the camp city without providing time for them to be prepared emotionally, or saying goodbye to fellows may make the trauma worse.
Syria's U.S. army, France, and Turkey retreated immediately
Speaking in the United Nations High Conservation, the Prime Minister of the Al-Moulalem Walid, urging Syria to return, even though the war in that country has reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also held the prime minister's teamship position, said the foreign army in the Syria Under the heavier fight against the violence "will be punished accordingly."
"They have to retreat immediately and unconditionally," he told the trial.
Moualem asserts that "the war of violence has ended" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have lost their homes.
He said Damsyik would continue to fight this holy war until we destroyed the Syrians from both violent groups and “an alien resident. ”
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially for training and counseling the Kurdish and Syria Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 military forces on the earth that fight against this war.
Regarding the escape problem, Moualem said, the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "stroke outside country" that "he emptied the fear of rationality" that caused the escape not to come back.
"We've called international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicalizing things that were supposed to be humanity alone."
The United States and the European Union were warned that Syria would not be restored until the political agreement was established between Assad and the protester to end the war.
The U.S. Diplomats said the deal between Russia and Turkey to provide a free military zone in the Idlib rebels controlled has created an opportunity to continue the political abolition.
The Russian-Turki discussion has shifted a major attack by the Syrians supported by Russians in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, has the deal of real time and hopes that the military action will substantiate the jihads including the rebels of Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda, which will be "determinated."
The U.S. special U.S. program, Staffan de Mistura hopes to arrange the first meeting for the new committee, which contains the government and the repositor to raise the intersection and open the way for the elections.
Moualem declares the terms of the invasion of the Syrian kingdom on the committee, saying that the panel work must be limited to "checking the current assembly article," and a warning against interference.
Because Trumps are going to take the Second Distance
With that logical, Trump will win back the pill in 2020, but, as expected by the liberal observer, the accusing and scandal ended his president's responsibility before time.
In an unexpected situation as "The most dramatic life for a president's answer!"
Right now, there's no sign of punctuation.
Since 2014, the prime rate has doubled to 1,05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1,6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of prime audience at 2.4 million, plus 1.7 million, four years ago, following Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has preceded the cable rating, so 3.5 million of the audience on the prime night.
"This is a fire of interest because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, a publisher of the ABC "Designed Survivor," the story of the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed Capitol.

Outside money is flooding into the fierce competition of the Middle election Council.
Not surprisingly, the 17nd Pennsylvania election shows the flood of money, since the relocation of congress area shows two smugglers are now matching for the same chair.
Pittsburg subbandars redrawn the Democrat Conor - who won his chair in the particular course of the spring season.
The Lamb is fighting against another present - day smuggler, the representative of Keith Rothfus Republican, who is presently representing the 12-year-old Pennyslvania area, which is infiltrate with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that an old area had been visited by the Republicans.
The new 17th contest set up a fierce financial campaign between the financial engines of the main Congress Commissioner Democratic campaign (DCC) and the National Republican campaign (NRCC).
The Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in Mac's special election for Congress to the 18 Pennyslvania watched.
The cross has been won by the Republicans for a second, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 eyes.

The U.S. Thinks for El Savador Because of Support against China, then Back Up
diplomats of the Dominican and Panama Republic have recognized Beijing, with a little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama so that the partnership of Trump's management teams kicked out.
The Government Department decided to call back the U.S. diplomatic chairman of the United States from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for "the latest decision to not recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department spoke in the early reality of this month.
But fines were charged only with El Salvador, which had $140 million in U.S. help forms in 2017, including drug control and economic support.
The fines, including the pieces of the financial help and the corresponding visa limit, will affect the Central American country with high rate of disabilities and murder.
After the internal meeting was held, Central American and Central American officials held a high-level trial that gave focus on security and economic prosperity, for the following similar meetings last year that seemed a positive step in preventing immigrants into the United States.
But in the middle of September, the boarding officer decided that they wanted the trial to continue, effectively stopping any judgment to handle El Salvador.
President Mike Pence will now give a speech in that trial, scheduled in mid- October, as a sign of importing the administration place at the meeting, according to diplomat.
And the third American representation returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no strong message or fine from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the debate detail described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who have agreed to discuss internal considerations with the terms of namelessity.
Their description is supported by an external analyst close to administration and is also spoken by a nameless condition.
History Study
What's going to happen next probably reports the special lawyer Robert Mueller of the possibility of a barrier to justice by Trump, which now has solid evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also draw investigation to investigate whether the Trump campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our election.
If the congress shifts hands, Trump will face an accountability on that side, as soon as he is ready to face the lockdown, and perhaps finally the jury that contains his equal partner.
It's all if, and I didn't say that Trump's fall must have happened - or people like him in Europe.
There's a choice that we all need to make in both parts of the Atlantic that will affect how long this struggle is.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a test of power against Hitler, if the West hadn't followed Hitler and supported Czechoslovak in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed a chance to avoid the brutal murder that happened in the next few years.
History travel rounds around such inflation points, and democracy run will be accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing some of this inflexibility point now.
What are we gonna do if Trump paints a Rod Rosenstein State attorney, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had a problem since this newspaper made a report that, last year, she had planned to make the president's recordings and make a speculation that the president was not qualified for the position.
Rosenstein said The Times's not right.
"How will we act if the FBI's new investigation of the Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair or if he's confirmed to the Agong Court even if there's a real sexual attack and fraud evidence?
And more, are we gonna vote for the congressman's enforcement of which Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in that test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail, because the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a descendant of Czechoslovak who had been banished to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had conquered my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with swasthics.
So as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers became the master of Rapid Vienna's house on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austria, following a series with Spain against the early Villarreal of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify them in the group of G in the European League.
The injury in the knee prevents Graham Dorrans' middle player from making his extended season into a series of 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers uses this decision as a loncation stone for a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
"We play in this game with the belief that we're going to get something and we've got one eye.
We may be able to win at the end of the match, but a series may be more fairer.
They might play better in the middle of the first and we're playing better in the middle of the second and on the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hope we get three eyes but the game is hard because they get good results in the previous game but, the audience supports us, I'm sure we'll play well and get positive results.
Last year it was hard, between all of my injuries, and the engagement in the club, but there were fun factors about this place today.
Good squads and teams are fun; training is good too.
We wish we could make the best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of this pension worry.
They have even been able to speak to family members about the obvious idea of how to care for them.
Half of the induvidu in the research of the entire state is stimulating that they've been discussing with their spouse about long-term maintenance costs.
Only ten percent of them have talked with their children about it.
"They want family members to keep them but don't take steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, the team of president's entire State insurance business business team.
Here is a way to start.
Talk to your mate and your children: You will not be able to provide for a family if you do not tell them first.
If you are a parent, work with your counselor and your family to discuss where you are going to live and how to care for the needs of caregivers, such as the options will likely help you to evaluate the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your adviser may be in a position to obtain a way to pay for that.
The fund of long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, one hybrid cash insurance policy to help protect this expense or your self-said insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Finish your legal document: Finish legal warfare at a time.
Set health care representatives in the place so that you can select individuals whom you trust to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals decide what they want you to do if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the letter of a representative to your finances.
You'll choose the person you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you don't try.

According to Tory Parliament Members, NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for running Brexit negotiations

We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone refuses that public opinion has changed since the 2016 undian: 'The idea that the British have changed the mind and desire to remain is not exactly.'
Brexit Tory's assistant, Andrea Jenkyns who also followed the procession, told the reporter: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people's voice.
'Cachuers are not popular among the public, the Confederates won't vote, it's not popular in our party and the activities that are on the street and who have voted on us.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.'
In the message addressed to May, he added: 'The minister will continue to take their jobs if they keep their promises.'
Farage says the politicians need to feel the material' if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is the trust between us--the people-- and the political class,' he said.
'They tried to betray Brexit and we were here to tell them we wouldn't let them escape by doing that.'
In the message to the excited public he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, to feel the fog.
'We're preparing the people's armies that give us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom free, have its own rulership, pride.'
In the meantime, Remainer marched through Birmingham before having a meeting in the center of the city.
The activist spreads a piece of Tories's banishing Brexit after the group launching at the end of the week.

'They say they can put it on its place and all the tech with Canada and so on, for the border without negotiations, for the trade without border,' he added.
'This is all the concrete.
There's nothing called Brexit's good,' he added.

It was obvious that at that time, Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "Mercedes's army command plays an important role in this race.
From the beginning of the square, the Bottas started well, nearly defeated Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and took Vettel against his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit first and left Hamilton in the traffic at the end of the group, something that should be done.
Mercedes then went into the pit at the next round and went out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire action to the tire that made the Ferrari driver leave the inside of free over the risk of defending himself after the act defending the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the back grid and is in the 7th place after the first round on his 21th birthday.

President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday assembly on the orders of a woman he didn't report a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing an Agong Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at the assembly in West Virginia, the president did not constantly answer about the testimony given before the Senate Justice Committee, rather than comment that what happened at the Senate pointed to the people of "hot and ugly and liar."
"A thing that could happen and a beautiful thing happened in the last few days at the Senate, when you see anger, when you see the angry, cruel, ugly and liars," he said.
"When you look at exposure and leaking and they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember the answer... did you block the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we divert... no, we didn't leak," he added, by making that senator's face expression.
Feinstein has sent a letter details of the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July last, and the letter was bombed in September - but Feinstein denied that the leaking came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak the story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it as hard and I kept it as hard as I asked."
But the woman's fiction didn't like the president, who gave a comment at the Saturday meeting: "I tell you, it's bad gestures.
Maybe he didn't do that, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
By defending the future Agong Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democratics use the charges for their own purposes.
"They're determined to get power back in any way.
You see, cruelty, disability, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to get power and control," the Mediaite reported the president said.

sad women send postcards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in death were employed to prevent others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have published a letter at the Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers to be contacted for support.
Davis's son, Tyler was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel as I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney, says his son's a potential cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him with his smile.
They always say his smile can turn any room. "
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother, who was then 11 years old, met his brother after his brother took his suicide.
Davis said: "I'm afraid I'm constantly if this will cause other things to happen."
Davis created a card, "to inform the people that there is someone you can meet and talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit quietly - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark's wife for 15 years, not long after Mark's mother died.
"He didn't tell me that he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Someday before Christmas we saw his personality change.
She's very sad on Christmas-- when the kids open their gifts, she doesn't look at them or anything."
He said, "The death of his mate has been a great trauma for them, but they have had to pass it: "It has made a big hole in the family.
It makes us split up.
But we have to keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depended on when the FBI started an investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants--a limited time investigation, a small scope-- we can bring to uniti," said Flake on Sunday, adding that "car-channel" committee in gardening based on belief that has been rooted.
Why does Kavanaugh and the Republican support don't want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to age.
The midwive election of arch in just five weeks, and on the 6th November - if, as expected, the unsatisfied Republican decision, they would be weaker to get the person they want to pay for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has made a call to Senator, lobbying them to support Kavanaugh, who's been working in White House for Bush and through Bush has met his wife Ashley, who became secretary to Bush.
What will happen after the FBI provides a report?
Undian will be run in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are in the field.
Not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate chair, which will allow Mike Pence, the president's team, to compare the series and confirm his position in the Agong Court.
Number of North Korea's dropdowns at the bottom of Kim
The number of North Korean relocation number has been reduced since Kim Jong-un took over the power seven years ago, according to South Korea's legislation.
Park Byeong-seug, picking up data from the South Destination Ministry, says that there were 1.127 lockers last year - covered with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says a more tighter border control between North and China and the high rate that a man's smuggler is a major factor.
Pyong who didn't give any public reviews.
Most of the North Korean repairers will be offered to South Korea.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have sanctioned the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to rally than the Free Army Zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
The Chinese view the prosecution as illegal immigrants as not a political refugee and often forcing them back in force.
The connection between the North and the South has been technically improved since the last few months.
Early this month, the chief of both countries met in Pyongyang for a discussion centered on the intersection of a suspended nuclear power.
This happened after a historic month June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in the common sense to go to the nuclear free direction of the island of Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. partition that slowed down the negotiation development since the event.
"Without any trust from the U.S., our nation's safety is unsafe and therefore, we won't start a nuclear acceleration first," Ri said in the United Nations United Nations Assembly, New York.
Nancy Pelocy calls Brett Kavanaugh "emocy," and it doesn't fit in the Agong Court
The head of the Minoriti Council of Nancy Pelocy calls the candidate Court Agong Brettt Kavanaugh "emocy" and says, the nature is not appropriate to hold a position in the Mahlamah Agong.
Pelocy made the following comment on Saturday’s interview at the Tribune Texas Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they're going to say that woman's 'em,' telling the Pelocy about the reaction to Kavanaugh's description in front of the Senat Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally has denied the claim that he had committed a sexual attack on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening of her reality, Kavanaugh spoke up and cried almost halfway together when discussing the family and while in high school.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling charges against him "tow and polluted good names" which was directed by the liberal Hilary Clinton still killed in the president's election in 2016.
The Pelocy said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirming that he did not deserve to hold a position in the Agong Court, because it showed that he was partial against Democrat.
"I felt he had lost his own credentials and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
The posociates hesitated when they were asked whether he would try to claim Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrat gets majoriti at the Representative Council.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't speak right to Congress and the FBI, he's not qualified to hold a position in the Agong Court, but only in the court he is now," said the Pelocy.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at D.C. Rayuan Litar Court
The trigger added that as Democrat, he was worried about Kavanaugh's decision on the Mampu care Akta or Roe v. Wade, because he was suspended as a conservative court.
In the verification trial, Kavanaugh avoid answering whether he will change Agong's decision.
"It's not the time for a couple of people to go to court and hope we say, 'What a pleasure,' says the Pelocy.
And the woman needs to show it.
It's a normal word of nista, a lot of months and many years, and he doesn't hold off anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't feel it's something incredible, do you agree?"
He continued: "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said he also cried when he was angry, but had created a technique, if he was angry and started to cry, he would say to the person he spoke, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
Then he goes on.
And I feel it's a wise suggestion."
Resentment is allowed as a way to channel anger because it is often misunderstood.
One of the most unforgettable memories of old work, in the office that was dominated by a man, I found myself crying with an indignable angry notice, I was drawn by an older woman on the neck of a cold manager who I was eager to pull me into the ladder.
"Don't show them your crying," he told me.
"They don't know that you're mad.
They think you're sad and will be happy for the success of making you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a female congressman from Colorado, used to work with Gary Hart during his president's campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested, a hard deal in the boat called Monkey Business came out of the game, Ms. Schroeder, was so disappointed, and it felt no reason to stop him from joining the president's campaign.
"It's not a good-fashioned decision," said he laughed at me 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates who compete and they don't need another candidate.
There's something calling Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because of the events that occurred at the end of the campaign, the woman lost her efforts to establish the tube, and she vowed that she would not fight until she did not get $2 million.
It's a pointless struggle.
He found his supporter who gave $1,000 to a man would give him only $250.
"Do they feel I get a discount?" she said.
When he spoke that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt so much grateful to those who supported him, disappointed by the system that made him beg for contributions and that excite the voter as a non - candidate, and he was angry about sexism - and he felt as if he were a sluggish.
"You're going to think I'm having a broken heart," reminding Schroeder of the way the media responds to him.
"You'll think Kleenex is my corporation handler.
I remember when I was thinking about it, what would put it on my nesan rock?
"He's crying?"
U.S.-China Trade War may benefit Beijing.
The outburst of the U.S. War between China and the country may be aggravated, and even if the battle is not over, the differences between these two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, according to the experts.

The most evident increase occurs this week with the new rate that will affect $200 billion ($150 billion) for the item, the effect of wearing taxes on half of the stuff that enters into the US from China.
Beijing retaliates in the same way every time, lately, wearing a five to ten percent rate over 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to repay every U.S. for action, and the largest number two of the world's economics is not impressed.

According to the experts, if Beijing were to play a card properly, the pressure of the U.S. War can support China positively in the long run by lowering each other's dependence between these two countries.
"The political decision is quick by either Washington or Beijing can start an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and look more dangerous than what the monitored before," said Abigail Grace, the felow investigation that gave attention to Asia at the Central to New American Security group, thinkers.

The government will continue to restore the area that terrorists have destroyed to restore to normal conditions.
Now the situation is ready to return a willing fugitive, to the country they have to leave because of the violence and the unital economic steps that have affected the daily life and their search eyes.
The UN threatened over 5,5 million Syrian citizens had fled since the war began in 2011.
