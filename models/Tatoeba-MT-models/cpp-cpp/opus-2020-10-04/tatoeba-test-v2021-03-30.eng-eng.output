He's not a good cook.
Tom said he wasn't in any hurry.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you were not Canadians.
Come to watch us play music at times.
Tom said he understood why Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my co-op housing.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure whether he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know that Tom might need to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing.
It would've been tiring to do that.
Tom must've told us the truth.
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary was really planning to do that this week.
Tom knew he'd be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he had nothing to eat, but that was not true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home in bed with a cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that.
Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that on her own.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom is hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know that Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why is everyone staring at us?
I know that Tom didn't know who had done that to Mary.
I reason that Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me that she thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I'd've left early if I could've.
I know that I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said that she thought Mary wasn't asleep.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think that I'm going to have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would've wanted to go to Boston with you.
I know that Tom is much more creative than Mary is.
I know that Tom is much more creative than I am.

I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom said he's desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know that Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you've read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom never should've left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said she thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said that he was glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said that he likes to dance with Mary.
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must've seen us do that.
I doubt that Tom will run for the president.
Tom should've done this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary wouldn't be mad.
I knew that Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.
I know that Tom knew he didn't need to do that.
I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.
Tom said that Mary knew that she might not have to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be so angry.

I suspect Tom and Mary are bored.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I can do what Tom is doing.
Why don't anyone listen to me?
Riches don't interest me.
Tom said that he thought I seemed impressed.
Tom said he had no object to leaving early.
It's not for the starters.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were depressed.
I think Tom doesn't know how to swim.
Tom has many friends here.
Tom knows he cheated.
I think that Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early as tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many miles are it from here to the railroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviors and speech patterns that characterise the advantage.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking of having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he'd be doing that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.
Tom said he was through doing that.
Tom said he's appealing his suspension.
He's deeply attached to her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to assume that Tom is dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we going to do?
I could've cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought that you said that we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.
I think I know what Tom is doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be happy to help.

We go to school every day except on Sundays.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't hungry.
Tom thought that he probably wouldn't survive.
Tom told me he thought Mary was bilingual.

Tom thinks I need to go.
Tom told everyone that he didn't understand French.

She's a shopping addict.
Tom said Mary was going home to Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't sleepy.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought that you said Tom was a barber.
I wonder if this really works.
Let's get to the point.
Did you give Tom the key?
Tom didn't seem to be surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to be married to Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom often does that by himself.
I've learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now.
Tom said that he was planning to stay home all day.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
Tom said he believed Mary.
I'm afraid I can't finish this report on time.
Tom was about thirty years old when he moved to Boston.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.
I know that Tom doesn't know that he doesn't really have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know that it's not worth it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they felt offended.
I'm very grateful to you.

Tom says he's not guilty.
No one laughs at Tom's joke.

We're planning to go tomorrow.
I think Tom snores is louder than Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You'd better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to do that.

Tom said Mary's probably still scared.
Tom and Mary said they did that on Monday.
Tom doesn't know that I've never done that.
Tom told me that I should go to Boston with Mary.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I'd've liked to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by itself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a animal party.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom won't have to do that today.
I hope I don't need to do that.
Tom must've changed a lot.
No one's better at this than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell that he was angry.
I know that Tom knows that he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.

I didn't know you'd be through doing that by 2:30.
Tom said he'd be thirteen next month.
I wish I was on your side!
Get your paws off me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you recently retired.
I knew that Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should've just walked right in.
I don't think you've been listening to me.
We're brothers and sisters.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Haven't you got a television?
Don't give up!
I don't play the rulelin as well as you.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
The feeling is mutual.
Tom has known Mary since she was a kid.

I'm sure Tom feels the same way you do.
Tom said he felt sick.

I hope no one follows you.
Tom knows he should've been able to do that better.
I know Tom will be motivated to do that.
Do you think we should've talked to Tom about this?

How do I improve?

They told me that they'd be discreet.
I should've written it down.
I'm no longer hungry.
You can do it.

It's not very likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you were not planning on doing that next winter.
I don't know what this means.
I think it's more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
Do Tom and Mary both snore?
It's way past the time Tom promised he'd be here.
We're not going on vacation.

There's no question about it.
No one can solve the problem.

I shouldn't have allowed you to do that.
I've already met everyone.

Tom might be sleeping.

I don't care whether you do that or not.
It's not science rocket.

There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.

I think that's wrong.
There's a place for everything.

I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought she might be required to do that the next time she travels.
I am as happy as I can be.
If they'd known what was about to happen, they'd've changed their plans.
I know that Tom didn't know that he didn't want to do that.
Tom is rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.
Go wake up Tom and tell him that breakfast is ready.

I should've left early.
Tom said she knew Mary might not have to do that by herself.
Tom said his failure was due to bad luck.

We split up the loot three ways.
I don't think Tom can do that by himself.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time does the show start?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom won't probably go jogging with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he'd be able to do that.
I know that Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep left at the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Are you afraid the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I am disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspect Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I'd've done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure that no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspect Tom may not have enough money to buy everything he wants.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the twentieth of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on going.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have children.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I don't think that book is so interesting.
I was told that it wasn't a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is going to continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think that you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should've known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know that you and Tom worked together.
No one will know that I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought she might be required to do that the next time she travels.
I knew that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know that Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew that Tom would be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought she might not have to do that by herself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not gonna end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The students did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you're called.
My daughter is being trained toilet.
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary could've done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know that Tom is a picky eater and rarely try anything new.
Tom said he did nothing illegal.
I suspect Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assume Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom can help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he didn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom would have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he was being rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should've let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should be talking about that.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me that he couldn't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not need to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know that Tom is a bully.
He's a very clever boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said that she thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to her.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it seems.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't actually want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must've been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said that she was glad that Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book that she'd lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could've done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary have not yet told anyone they're getting married.
They said they planned to go on Monday.
It's not gonna be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't speak so fast, please.
They told me that they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they had to do that.
I think Tom paid way too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was busy.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was done.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should've stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says that he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could've kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew that I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to.
We married seven years ago.
I could've done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could've done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
He's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom'd've done that?
That's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should've tried harder.
I thought Tom was gonna do that today.
They promised that they'd check on it.
I'm sure Tom'd've agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must've put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said that he was glad that you'd do that.
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom is really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said that she thought Mary was good in French.
Tom says that he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just want you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just have a hard-boiled egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of the year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust her.
They say they declined the deal.
I know that Tom didn't know that you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know that Tom is a really close friend of Mary's.
I know that Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would be unlikely to agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could've asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I'd've done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore that they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should've stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should've left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicts Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's amused by what's going on?
We haven't started fighting yet.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me that they were ambidextrous.
Tom said that he thought that what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said that she thought that Mary was in her bedroom studying.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me that it didn't matter.

I'm twelve.
I'd forget about that.
Tom told everyone that he was through doing that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were happy.
I thought that you said that you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know that Tom is much higher than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that it's gonna happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You're not gonna do such a thing.
You're so hot!
Tom would've been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know that Tom knows that I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know that Tom didn't know that he shouldn't be doing that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom has read many books about that.
I think Tom has done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why is everybody talking about Tom?
Federer held in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said that he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail?
If something sounds too good to be true, then it might be.
Tom said that he hopes that you won't want to do that.
Tom said that he wanted that he hadn't been there.
I thought that you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We might need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know that Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not gonna do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should've turned left back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
He doesn't like snakes and mathematicals.
I knew that Tom didn't want to do that, but he did anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew that Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not feasible with the current technology.
They said they were trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by itself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he was not allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to talk about.
I think Tom would refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said that he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.

Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than she is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said that she thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know that Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom would like this wine.
I believe we spoke on the phone.
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He is not a virtuous.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what she had to do.
I know that Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should've stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he was planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf can't be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should've been doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that it might happen?
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your payung when you leave here.
I'll see it that's done.
I wear a suit but wear no tie.
I'm as tired as you are.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should've apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you certain Tom will do that?
We can't live without water.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.

Last night I puked.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave her something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said Mary is going to do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe that Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was twenty years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it OK if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by herself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he'd've done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you'd do that.
Mary let me know that she's not planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
Tom didn't know that Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said that she thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not gonna happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said that he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew that Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should've told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could've happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes her or not.
I got lost in the forest.
I know that Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me that he'd be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that she had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Have you got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it'll take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I know that you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he was trying to do that all week.
You have really beautiful teeth!
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew it was gonna happen.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Do you know that Tom and Mary have three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I know that Tom has finished doing that already.
I know that you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should've done that.
There must be a reason that Tom isn't here.
It's not proper to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that she thought Mary could run faster than she could.
Tom said Mary was scared.
You should've been the last to do that.
I know that Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could go wrong?
No one could've stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said that I would do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's overemotional.
I am immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me that to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said she thought Mary could take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.

I think Tom won't be surprised.
I know that Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said she thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I know that Tom knew who was going to do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said that he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knew that we were.
Tom said that he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not need to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said that he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should've brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
They told me that they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know that Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know that I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know that Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have been doing that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.

They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said that he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have the time to do that with us today.
I know that Tom is very opinionated.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew that Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom is not so sure.

I couldn't keep looking at it.

You know it's not like that.
I'd've been unable to do that without your help.
I knew that Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he was looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should've anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom wasn't aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.

I don't think you should've left early.
Tom said Mary wouldn't probably be able to do that.
Tom said she thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore.
I had no idea you knew Tom.
We'll discuss this problem later.
I don't think Tom has anybody to help him.
How is it going?
Tom thinks he can do whatever he wants.
I know that I can't do that as well as Tom can.
I know that Tom is planning on doing that tomorrow.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be interested.
It's not especially hot today.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that kind of thing.
If you don't go, I won't either.
What's your plan?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know that Tom doesn't know that I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought that Mary didn't like her.
Tom said he did nothing illegal.
Tom said he's already doing that.
I think you're gonna be OK.
I knew that Tom was still willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that she was glad that it had happened.
The computer has stopped working.
We know that you're not stupid.
She didn't turn up after all.
We both know that's a lie.
Tom knows we're not supposed to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom's in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should be doing.
Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you might know.
Tom's flaky.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says that he won't win.
Tom was aware that they were following him.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in big trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom wouldn't have done that if Mary had asked her not to.
I thought that you said that you were not interested.
It was harder to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom's going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope that you're healed.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You should've listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your fast-food restaurant favorite?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we can do that.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary wanted to do that.
The clock has stopped.
Tom and I both grew up in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom will be back soon.
I didn't think we had enough money.
You should've heard me, I cried as loud as I could.
I'm giving you what you want.
I knew that Tom was expecting Mary to do that for her.
I know that Tom is a good writer.
They said they wouldn't want to do that.
They said they'd eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I will always.
No. No.
I know that Tom's not a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'll be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone that he was unemployed.
I know that'll be hard to do.
How are you planning on doing that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a bit out of shape!
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should've been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you had learned that right now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wish they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom was planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that she hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad nobody's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom would probably know how to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know that Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his payung on the train.
I'm a lot higher than Tom.
I know that Tom can speak French.
I know that Tom would be quicker to do that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I've always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew that I was planning to do that.
You should've been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you're not the ones who did that.
Tom said he didn't have the power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
I should've been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt very seriously that Tom did that on purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should've done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
I suspect Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom is as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided her eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by myself.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what she did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should've introduced myself.
Tom said Mary was looking forward to retirement.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by itself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are OK.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time that you and I went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me that he was asleep.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I ran off the lid.
Tom said Mary was probably in Australia now.
Tom said he didn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I'd've helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought that you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he was not willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary had a driver's license already.
I know that Tom is a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should've done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervane.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw it up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must've left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy getting married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I guess Tom's still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone she knows enjoyed doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom probably can do that sometimes.
Did you let your children play on the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom's not bad.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom is moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom can make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should've done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was deceived.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary's thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm hatching apples.
They said they'd never study French.
They said that they thought I was creative.
Tom told me that he was uncertain what he should do.
Tom told me that I should've said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the refridge.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said that he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said that he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he didn't plan on going with us this weekend.
I don't think that Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know that Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought that you said that you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told her that she should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe that everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know that I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom says Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think that anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know that you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom is doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know that Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think that you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could've done that better.
Tom said that he wanted Mary not to do that by himself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that it's not gonna happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said that he'd give a book to Mary.
It would have been unbearable.
I know that Tom would probably know how to do that.
I know that Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly blamed.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was gonna be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really like to do that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me that he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by itself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This is not salt.
Has anyone here seen Tom?
Tom told me that she thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room that I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he was planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romantic novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone that he was prepared to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They say they're irritated.
I think Tom's probably gonna be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said that their houses were not for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should be doing now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least one time.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be asleep.
Can someone help me?
I know that Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easygoing.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It looks like Tom like everybody.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to settle into her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore that they'd never do that.
Everyone's standing there, surprised.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry that I wasn't as careful as I should've been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary's sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, didn't you?
They wish they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said that she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone's got to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said that he didn't think that you could win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said that I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough is enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could've hit me.
They told me that they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know that I was still planning on joining the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said that he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted to speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I've left my payung in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I've promised Tom that I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said doing that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to obey.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom threw his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says that he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance examination?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says that he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were bored.
Tom said that he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know that there will be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you talking about?
Tom said that he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They're inseparable.
Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised that they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must've done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should've expected that to happen.
It would've been wise to do that.
Tom told me that he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom has to be irritated.
For how long has your head been hurting?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should've gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He has earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told her he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know that Tom is a millionaire.
Tom said that he thought doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last to do that.
Tom'd've done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that it's not very likely to happen.
They say that drugs are not safe.
I know that it's very unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you'd do what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a chleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said that he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should be talking to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said that I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You've got a big head.
He's very smart.
I'd never hired Tom.
Does Tom know that you've done that already?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said that he didn't think that anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said that he thought I'd want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom'd've done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wouldn't do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time is taken.
I think Tom is conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll stop doing that.
Tom is incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad that I did.
Tom said that he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said that he thought Mary couldn't do that.
I know that Tom is a golfer, maybe he can teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew that Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else are you planning to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's down.
I know Tom is talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary gets back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary Goodnight last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew that Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely that Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should've quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought that you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was gonna leave her.
You're not still afraid, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it'll cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know that Tom is nice.
Tom already knows Mary is planning on doing that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wouldn't do that again.
Tom should've been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was sick.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary should've done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they were not ready to talk.
I know that Tom wasn't the one who was supposed to do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the television guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.

I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French?
I'm a doer damage.

You could've gone.

Do you all think this is a good idea?

Do you have children?

I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive.
I'll come back.
I don't think Tom's a nosy.
I'd've never done that.

I knew that Tom wasn't a very good singer.

I wish I had gone to Australia with Tom.
You're not answering me.

Both Tom and Mary need this.

I figured everyone was busy.

I should've kissed Mary.
I thought that you said you've seen Tom do that.
Tom said that Mary thought she might want to do that evening.
It must have been a shock to you.
Tom and I were both wrong.
All of our blood goes through our kidneys about sixty times a day.
I don't think that doing that is a bad idea.
He pressed his nose against the glass.
I don't think anybody really thinks Tom was happy.
We should've gone to Boston last month.
Tom should do that somewhere else.

I need a doctor!

I won't be able to come in to work today because I have to take my son to the hospital.
Is that your car?
Tom is looking for someone to teach French to his children.

You have the best of following the doctor's advice.

I think Tom's annoyed.
Tell Tom he should visit Australia.
Tom and Mary said they felt disappointed.
I still make many mistakes.
He walks a lot.
I didn't think Tom would ever forgive Mary for doing that.
Tom has a car, but he rarely uses it.
Let's go out for some ramen.
I'm convinced that I'm right.
Tom told me that I'm last.

I hope you get the chance to do that.

I wish I could speak French.
Tom told me he did that for us.
Tom likes to play with this dog.
I'm wasting my time.
Tom said Mary should do that in the other room.
I should've advised Tom not to believe what Mary said.

Now you mention it, I can smell it, too.
Are you suggesting that I'm lying?
Tom talked to Mary as well.
Tom said Mary was not desperate.
I don't think Tom knows who will help Mary do that.
You've confused the students.
I suspect Tom will come to Boston.
It's not safe to drink this water.

I've never met anyone like you before.
It would've been hard to do that.

Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.

I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.

Tom ran back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problem with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know that you're not mistaking me for someone else?
You should've refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.

Tom should never have been released.
His train arrived at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.

I know what I'm gonna do.
He didn't have to bring the payung.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me that you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know that we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.

I read many foreign languages, but speak no.
You set up a trap.
I should've added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.

It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.

Tom and Mary said they'd do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.

We'll never know.

Didn't you know that your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom is never gonna hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll land in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were gonna fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not gonna be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know that Tom didn't know that he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should've told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologize to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John would actually do that.
They say they also need to do that.
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that.

Tom thought that Mary didn't like computer games.

You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unafraid.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know that Tom isn't afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me whether I liked it or not.
Many old people these days can't keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know that Tom appreciates that.
Tom told me he'd decided to do that.
It's a kind of paint.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom said that he thought doing that would not be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait till morning?
We're gonna land in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom is unprejudiced.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was probably a grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know that Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said that he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said that he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
I'd've helped you if you asked.
Okay.
Tom said that he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should've done that a long time ago.
I think Tom's sleeping all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom is upset.
Tom said that he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said that he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom'd've done that for Mary if she'd had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning on going to Boston with you.
Tom said that she wasn't sure Mary had to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know that you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said that he thought doing that would be fun.
I think that you'll find out that it's Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are gonna do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Are you still planning on doing that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you would be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that it's not true.
Let's assume that'll happen.
Tom told everyone that he didn't know what to do.
Tom needs someone he can trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was telling the truth.
It's quite likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think that anyone had tried that before.
You should've made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could've done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was difficult to get along.
They said they were very drunk.
You could've told me earlier.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know that Tom never does that again.
Tom says that he only swears when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said that she thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20th.
They said they're doing just fine.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I'd've done that if I could've.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew that he was arrested.
Tom wanted that he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said that she thought Mary was gonna be able to do that.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that it's not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said that he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must've left the window open.
I know that Tom is a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been some mistakes.
I know that Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just saying the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know that Mary was not happy.
Tom said he'd be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts that you'll be able to pass the examination.
Where's everyone?
How have you been feeling?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should've hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where's your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said that she thought Mary would be able to help her do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he was glad Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you would've wanted.
I know that it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom would be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said that he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophomore.
Tom certainly knew that he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom shouldn't have tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I'd've let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary wanted to do that alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swore that they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know that Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said that Mary would do that.
They've said that they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.

We went up by two floors to reach the clothes stalls.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he's gonna die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should've talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me that she thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that she thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it was a very common problem.
Are you sure this'll work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know that you can hear me.
You seem to be unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that she thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what she thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought she might need to do that.
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again.
I don't think it ever works.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know that Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know that Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan to stay home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing.
We both love Tom.

I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that evening.

There's no time to explain.

They're living in a fantasy world.
They said that they thought I was charming.
I didn't know that Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have much fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom has already told me that he decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to lend me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone that he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a French speaker native.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they've taught French.

I know that Tom knows that I don't need to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't.

I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should've refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car and neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he was no different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could've been scared.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said that he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would've come if we'd invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.

I'm absolutely sure that it's not gonna happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had completely recovered.
I didn't know that you were not planning to do that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There's no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought that Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.

Tom said that he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom will let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He'll have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh veg is sold here.
I believe this isn't a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.

I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought that you said that you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied her meeting Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländer.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They say they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.

I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.

I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.

Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me that he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew that Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked her to.
We can't pretend Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.

Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm higher than him.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said she thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom set his glass down.

This is the first time I've bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend the meeting today.
Tom and Mary said they didn't agree to do that.
I know that Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.

There is no logical reason for this.
I suspect Tom was intoxicated.
I hope that I give you enough money to buy everything you need.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.

Tom should've never got that job.
Tom told Mary that she was her only one and only.

Tom said that she knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary was not mad.
I think we've bought everything we need.
Tom said that he thought he might not need to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's a average.
You're not just working for Tom.

I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.

Tom is homesick.
Did you know that would happen?

I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought that you said we weren't gonna do that anymore.

That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me that they were ambidextrous.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped to buy a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.

No matter what you say, I'm convinced that I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We can't make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard that Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me that he'd do that.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect that Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he's gonna try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom's strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he'd've done that if he could've.
I don't think that anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wanted to kiss Mary Goodnight.
If you do that, I will too.
I think Tom is irreplaceable.

That's not what Tom wants you to do.
Which book did you give Tom?

How are you doing today?

Tom didn't tell anyone.
It's Tom's thirtieth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said that she didn't think that Mary really did what John said she did.

I should've known Tom would be busy.

I think Tom won't be early.

Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom is married anymore.
Tom said that she thought Mary would be alone.

Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife.
I know that Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do that.
Tom's very rarely waiting for anyone.
I just assumed that everyone was going to do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried to do that by myself.

Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know that Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do that by myself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom would probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this last year.
I'd've talked to Tom instead of just ignoring him.
I thought you'd want to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know that Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
We're at school together.
I would like you to look over these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they'd be going by train.

I thought it would clear up in the afternoon.

I'm late.

You can't buy happiness.
You promised that you'd do that.

It won't be as hard to do as you think it's gonna be.

Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.

I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary are not quicker to do that than me.
Tom said that he's glad you're back.

Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said that he knew he might not need to do that again.
They know that they should do that today.
You should've been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think that there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be pessimistic.
I don't think I can do that even if I try.
I know that Tom hasn't yet asked Mary to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented.
I don't think that doing that is a very good idea.

Tom told me that he'd drive Mary to the airport.

I think that this is the first time Tom did that.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished.
I know that Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must've been home at the time.
I don't think I'm gonna like being here.
There's no hope.
Tom could've gone camping with you if you'd let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though she'd asked her not to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says that Mary lies a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think that Tom is probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're pulling my leg.

Tom says the party's over.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I might not want to do that by myself.
Safety is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed that Tom had told you that I would be here.
Did you know I was going to get arrested?
She's a despicable human being.
Tom's already intending to do that.
Take off your uniform school.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know that Tom is almost as tall as you are.
The first time I met Tom, he was only 20 years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom has never done that.
I thought we could help out.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom plans to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wished he'd give Mary flowers.
They said they had alibis.
Tom was able to do what he needed to do.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I can't think of anything.
I wish you never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're as good as a driver as you say you are.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary had to do that.
They told me they were lonely.
What's the time now?
Tom said things went well.
Tom told everyone that he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one else was there.

He's not very good at the politics game.

They said they didn't feel hot.
This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.
Tom said he didn't plan to do that.
I thought you said no one would be here.
Tom thinks Mary is pushy.
I'm skint.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said that he assumed that Mary would want to do that.
One can't do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I'm used to stay late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do that somewhere else.
Nobody seemed to want to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might not be required to do that by himself.
No one told you about the meeting, did they?
I'm aware this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here right now.
I know that Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know that Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
I know that Tom was going to do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason not to do that.
Mary told me that she thought Tom was handsome.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't mind doing that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that outside.
I wonder if I should do that.
I suspect that Tom and Mary know something is going on.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me that she thought Mary had left.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that.
I know that Tom knows that Mary rarely does that again.
You're more brave than me.
Tom said he was getting drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said that she thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should've told Tom not to believe what Mary said.
It would've been interesting to do that.
If you had told me earlier, I would've dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why are everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They look at foreigners with suspicion; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could've let me know you'd be late.
Tom's deliberious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.
If I had known how to do it, I would've done it myself.
Tom repaired his bicycle.
You're not really planning on taking pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than I am.
Tom and Mary told me that they were frustrated.
I didn't know that Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought that you said you've seen people do that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Tom said he was reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said she thought Mary might help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.

There's not much we can do to help.

Tom's cooking.

Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?
I don't think I know that guy.
Tom said he planned to go on Monday.
I'm afraid that I might be late.
I put my helmet on.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
I knew that Tom would be able to do that if he really needed to.
Tom thinks you'll be here tomorrow.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
Tom must've seen it.
Tom may be a traitor.
I knew Tom wouldn't agree to do that.
They must have arrived home by this time.
Tom told me that he was going to talk to Mary about that.
I thought you were not going to tell anyone.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's shoe size is.
She'll do that if no one stops her.
Put your gun down!
She's my first love.
In summer, eggs soon go bad.

I have a lot of work to do before I can go home.
All we can do now is hope that Tom does what he promised to do.
I haven't read it.
I don't think Tom really wants to do that anymore.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this.
They've got a green carpet in the living room.
Tom said everyone she knows enjoyed doing that.
You're the next line for the promotion.
Didn't you know that Tom used to be married to Mary?
Tom said he liked doing that.

I know that Tom wasn't used to sit on the floor.
I've created a few websites.
Tom said Mary likes driving.
We're trying to close the box.
I know that Tom's gonna be through doing that.
Tom said he hadn't done any of that yet.
I think Tom's over thirty.
I didn't know that you were planning on doing that so soon.
We should've done what you advised.
I thought that you said you hated doing that.
Tom told me he wasn't an expert.
I know that Tom wouldn't ask Mary not to do that.
Christmas is just around the corner.
Tom is not very likely to want to do that.
Tom is the smartest person I've ever met.
A man called on you last night.
I'm a little drunk.
They're not as hard as they look.
I guess this is a step in the right direction.
I'll make sure that Tom does that sometimes.
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her.
I haven't understood anything you've said.
You should've left while you had the chance.
I thought that you said you had a dog.
No one's out of the woods yet.
Tom said we could go to Boston with him if we wanted to.
That won't change anything.
Tom's being mean.
We didn't know that Tom was gonna do that.
I didn't know you were still planning on doing that.
Hi, everybody!
I don't think that anyone would agree to do that
Tom couldn't believe that his vacation was over so quickly.
You can't make bricks without straw.
I don't play tennis as much as I used to.
Tom said Mary wouldn't probably be mad.
Tom and Mary say that they hope you win.
I asked Tom if he knew anyone who taught French.
I'm bored out of my mind.
Tom should've done what Mary told her to do.
Tom is someone you can trust.
I knew that Tom told Mary to ask John not to do that.
Tom and Mary say they'll help us today.
I'll stay home if it rains tomorrow.
If I had done my best, I might have succeeded.
I know that both Tom and Mary have finished doing that.
Tom'd've done that if you asked him to.
I know that Tom is a lot smarter than Mary is.
How much did you spend every day when you were in Australia?
I hope I can do that.
I meant it when I said I wanted to marry you.
I don't think anyone's satisfied.
It looks like someone has ripped a page out of this book.
I knew that Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you now.
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourself.
He's a man who gets things done.
I hope you'll be my friends.
Tom said he wanted to try riding an unicycle.
I thought you might know why Tom left early.
Tom assumed everyone knew that he'd spend time in prison.
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are.
They said they were very worried.
They told me that they were hungry.
It'll be done by the time you get here.
Tom may not have died in the accident.
Tom said that he thought he'd be able to find another job.
I thought that only happened in the fairytales.
I don't think Tom was busy today.
Tom said that he assumed Mary wouldn't cry.
I'll be there on the twentieth.
I don't think it's probably Tom will help us.
Tom must've cried.
Tom has lost both of his parents.
Tom said he could've done that on his own.
I doubt if doing that would be hard.
We must defeat our enemies.
Tom's upset.
They told everyone that they were suspicious.
I knew you wouldn't like it in Australia.
I know that I couldn't do that even if I tried.
I don't think I can move this bookcase without some help.
Tom said that she thought Mary was having a good time in Australia.
I know that Tom is a hockey fan.
Tom said that he knew that was what Mary wanted to do.
I don't think Tom knows I think he's stupid.
I hope Tom and I are not incumbenting you.
Tom told me that she thought Mary knew French.
Tom said he needed to be more careful.
I thought you and Tom didn't like each other.
You should tell Tom you're not planning to swim.
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary couldn't understand French.
Is it true Tom thinks I believe that?
I love playing my guitar.
They said they'd never leave early.
I didn't know that Tom would be able to do that by itself.
Tom may be desperate.
The road is parallel to the river.
I suspect that Tom and Mary know that something interesting is about to happen.
Tom let Mary know she needs to do that.
Don't let anyone in.
Tom said he felt tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
Tom's in this picture, too.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary didn't enjoy the movie.
Tom said he might win.
I don't think Tom and Mary are planning to help us.
That's not a bad option.
Tom told me that she thought Mary used to play the cello.
I know that Tom knows that I shouldn't be doing that here.
Tom looked angry when Mary said that.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary should do that again.
Tom said that he wanted to know if I could swim.
"Is it true?" "I think so!"
I'm not sure it'll do you any good.
Tom said Mary wasn't pessimistic.
I would like to report a crime.
I didn't know that Tom didn't know French.
I know that Tom didn't know how to do that.
Tom told me that I should do that soon.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I know I'm not alone.
They're not as innocent as they seem.
We don't have snow here.
I didn't think Tom would help us do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still heartbroken.
They may do that if they want to.
I know that Tom is a very shy boy.
Tom knew that I was angry.
That's all I have.
Tom doesn't want anyone to know he's going to Australia.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary really had to go yesterday morning.
I promise you I won't be late.
I knew that Tom had to do that by myself.
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
You could've done that yourself.
I wonder if the weather will hold.
It would've been romantic to do that.
I know Tom is a much better drummer than I am.
For here, please.
Tom said that he thought it would be dangerous for Mary to walk home by herself at night.
Did you know that Tom was gonna do that with Mary?
Tom told everyone that he was glad that it was gonna happen.
I know that Tom can swim better than I can.
Tom and Mary told me they had to go.
Tom wiped his mouth with the towel that Mary handed him.
Good job, everyone.
They must know I'm innocent.
You don't allow your children to do that, do you?
Tom's big-headed.
I don't think I should tell Tom that I'm going to Boston.
He likes to play football.
I know that Tom didn't know that Mary could do that.
I know that Tom is much stronger than Mary is.
Tom thought the burning car would explode.
Do you really think Tom is determined to do that?
Tom could be in Australia for a long time.
I think Tom could do that if he tried.
No one knew that you were in Australia.
No one has been injured yet.
I don't think it's up to us to decide.
You're handsome.
This is the first time I've ridden a horse.
They said they like to do that.
Stand back, please.
Tom tried hard to calm down.
We all wondered why he dumped such a nice man.
Those who know me know I can't do that.
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was on the school bus.
Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that early tomorrow morning.
Tom already knows that Mary is planning to stay in Australia for another three days.
How many kilos have you lost so far?
Tom and Mary say they feel very sleepy.
And I can't tolerate naughty children.
Tom said that she didn't think Mary was hungry.
I thought I heard someone talking.
You want to split a taxi with me?
I know that Tom didn't know that Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said that he wanted that he hadn't spent so much money.
I knew that Tom was expecting you to do that.
I know that Tom is bossy.
Why are everyone staring at you?
