Do you feel another symptoms?
Have you ever felt a suffocated breath?
Do you still feel the chest pain?
Because it's a flu season.
but we should not let go of the chest pain that comes from the heart
But the more important problem now is this chest pain
And I'm having trouble breathing
But I know a lot of coughs in my direction.
But we need to handle every chest pain very seriously
But right now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest pain.

You said that you felt this chest pain
Inside insulative coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that rises rapidly in the European and British Economy Union, January 1 to March 1520
Insiden the cumulative case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European/Wilayah Economic Economy of Europe and Britain that confirms that, although different levels depend on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic has developed very fast in all countries.
According to Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their identity for the circuits of COVID-19 patients who would need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unidentified pneumonia claster reported in Wuhan, Province Hubei, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, Tiongkok disease Control and Prevention Center reported your illness agents are new coronaviruss now called acid syndrome acids 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence until now indicates that about 80% of COVID-19 sufferers have had a mild illness, which is a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers recover.
At about 14% of the case, COVID-19 developed into a heavier disease and needed hospital care, while 6% other cases suffered critical diseases that require intensive care.
The mortality of patients being treated at the hospital by COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 cumulative incident trends of the European Economic EU/EA and Britain (UK) and compared them to the incident in the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA and UK to the number of cases in Italy for January 31th–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has a more geographic spread and the pandemic pandemic COVID-19 in other parts of the world are following pandemics in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, Director General General World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance, March 520, Spikery et al. reported the first Europeans with COVID-19 cases confirmed based on WHO's case definition.
In EU/EA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 to those who returned from Wuhan, province Hubei, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, the case COVID-19 has been detected throughout 30 EEA and Ingrisculture countries, between December 31 of December 2019 and 15 March 2020 and that date includes 39768 cases and 1.7277 deaths reported, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative number and cumulative case COVID-19
At the European Prevention Center and Control of Disease (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases that are informed of every nation is renovated every day at 8:00, this amount is only from official sources such as the country's health industry, national health and regional authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the COVID-19 trench in EU/EA and UK, and compare it to the trench in Italy.
As a prevalence of the case COVID-19 active, we count the 14-day cumulative incident, so count the natural trip COVID-19, in every country EU/EA and UK, in January 1-15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases that each country has been informed to March 1520 at 8:00 in compared with the Italian case during the 31th of January–15Maret 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK
A 14-day cumulative incident case of COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK are usually following the course of the Hubei Province (Tiongkok).
For EU/EA and UK as a whole, COVID-19 cumulative incident began to rise about 21 February, and then it increased sharply about 28 February 2020 (O.S.A.).
This Tren is especially moved by the rapid increase of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EA countries and UK shows the trend for similar COVID-19 cumulative incident growth.
Picture 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA and UKs compared with the cumulative number of Italians during the January 31–15 March 2020.
The data pointed out that up to 15 March 8,00, 15 other EU/EA countries and UK have reported the total number of cases that were equal to the total number of Italian cases in the past three weeks or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases known to rise quickly in EU/EEA and UK.
Tran that is observed on COVID-19 cumulative incident signals that pandemics rise at the same speed in all countries.
It's out of the differences of the countries, the variation of public health responses, and the possible difference between countries and protocol differences to choose patients that should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes review.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the nearest Italian area explained the situation about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive treatment units in this area have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, copying data of COVID-19 cases in the hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level is only available for each 6% and 1% case (data is not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the current surveying data that focus on the number of reported cases and death figures.
Audition performed in 2010-2011 showed great variations in the intensive care and obscene care in Europe, ran from 29,2 in Germany to 4,2 per 100,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that countries could have more resources or less than Italy (12,5 intensive beds of intensive care and madness per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
Skenario modifications associated with the power of health care, with the preestimation of a COVID-19 raw case for every EU/EA and UK country associated with the risks of >90% exceeding the capacity for intensive bedwork, provided in the sixth quick risk evaluation of CCVID-19.
Since this far the case is in particular regions of the EU/EA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are usually serving certain regional service cage populations, information about cases and intensive beds should be provided at the Territory Department level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemic has grown very fast in EU/EEA and UK.
Therefore, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should prepare for the transmissions of the SARS-CoV-2 community and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as happened in the closet region of Italy.
As shown in the quick risk estimates of ECDC recently, quick approach, proactive, and comprehensive is essential to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-22, with a transition from the approach to the mitigation, because the increase in the quick rate of the case, as anticipated, may not give enough time to the resulters and the hospital to understand, accept, and provide the correct responses if it had not previously applied.
That quick risk evaluation also includes public health steps to mimic the effects of pandemics.
There is a short window of opportunity when the country has the possibility of increasing its control effort in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EEA country's health care system is likely to face a patient report that needs intensive treatment in the next few days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which is due to heavy acid syndrome syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so far has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 800,000 people in Tiongkok and elsewhere in the world, which caused disaster for humans.
Similar to the homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS on thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-CoV may also be transferred from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanism.
Even so, COVID-19 has lower levels of insecurity and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and more about older than young people, and more than men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on this new disease, this article is trying to give a timely review and comprehensive of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etyology, viral, diagnostics, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Despite many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps understanding and elimination of this threatening disease.
The Semi season Festival on January 25, 2020 has been a memory that has never occurred and has been forgotten for all the Tionghoa people who are commanded to stay at home during vacations and a few weeks after the outbreak of new virus.
This virus was very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused heavy acute respiratory outbreaks (SARS) in 2003; therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization 11 February 2020, and the diseases that were called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemic began in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
Until 2 March 2020, this virus has resulted in 800,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warned that COVID-19 is "a public enemy number 1" and potentially damage more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pumed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 that sets the virus drying of some patients, over 200, then it's published about COVID-19, which includes virologi, epidemiology, egnosis, diagnosis, and treatment.
These surveys are trying to sum up the progress of research in this rapid new subject.
As possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease, which is Central Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, the plague in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far about prevention and disease prognosis and some other unanswered questions, but urgent.
According to tradition, CoV is considered nonletal patogen for humans, especially causing about 15% pilek 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found CoV very patogenic for humans twice, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the outbreak of the outbreaks of Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why COVID-19 is the third CoV plague in human history recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1,1, pneumonia claster first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Tiongkok National Health Commission.
Seven days later, CoV security has been launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan reported.
In the meantime, the epidemic spread quickly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, health care provider infections reported, which signal that human-human transmission might happen.
On January 23th, region quarantine was held in the city of Wuhan and the whole public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, from 41 patients with a verified case, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the early location of infection from unknown sources.
On January 30, WHO stated this plague as global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries throughout the world (Gbr.2,2).
Because the situation has grown very fast, the final cakupancy and the pestilence of the plague must still be set.
On February 11, 2020, multipublish studies on 8,866 patients, which include 4.021 COVID-19 patients are confirmed, presenting a picture of the more updated epidemics following (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/HlBi-HlPXaX/rHPXaqA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47,7%) of people infected over 50 years old, only a few under 20 years old, and only 14 people infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is more infecting men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in claster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes the average time 5 (2-9) days from awide to diagnostics.
The average incubation period is 4,8 (3,0-7,2) day.
The average time starts from awith to death is 9,5 (4,8-13) day.
Base reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3,51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4,82.
The number of infected people rose exclusively before Jan. 2020, according to the mass transport time before the spring Festival in Tiongkok.
The patients' mortality with a verified case of 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and mortality adapted to all patients at 3,06% (95% CI: 2.02-4,59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are sexy type (man), age ( tasty60), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of a coiled virus containing a single RNA sense camel.
CoV can be divided into four species, which are alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with an alpha-and-CoV is known to infect humans.
Glicoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) concrete with his cell recipe, angiotensic conversion enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and a diptidase 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the fuses of the membrane.
Virus RNA genes are released into the sitoplasma; after recomplicing the genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by glocoprotein covers and nucleoksid proteins forming vesicel containing virals, which then suffers a fusssion with the plasma membrane in order to release the virus.
First psychiatrist SARS-CoV-2 reported on January 10 of 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new-CoV type of beta with more than 99,98% of between 10 samples that were charged; the sample was taken from the origin of the plague site, which is the Juanan Sea Food market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin human breath channel.
ACE2 humans were found a receptionor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Even so, SARS-CoV-2 proteins of SARS and ACE2 are weaker than their connection with SARS-CoV proteins, which suits the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are insensitive insecurities of SARS-CoV infections to patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein provided with orf3b and proteins that are provided with orf8 passwords.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play in the virus pathogenity and inhybrid expression IFN Affairs; yet, orf8 does not have a functional domain or known motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the full cryo-EM ACE2 structure of humans at 2.9
They found that complex, which had open and closed agreements, formed dimers and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for the identification and infections of CoV.
B0AT1 can be a lively target in drug filtering to press SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Original and intermediate Inangs
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from bats and each is transferred to humans through musangs and camels.
By comparison of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics by another CoV, the bats are considered the original SARS-CoV-2 for this new virus 96% identical with two similar-SARSARS-like CoV from the bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate intel that helps the virus cross species’s barriers to infecting humans is still unknown, and the transmission routes must still be explained.
Ji, et al. proposes snakes as a virus bearer of bats to humans that involve homolog recombinaration in the S protein.
According to one study, researcher in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, propose that thumbling, antling mamalia is a long-song that is used in traditional Tionghoa medicine, potentially as a generic intermediate in 99% of CoV's homology found in tenggiling and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1 percent of the differences spread throughout the genome are still a major difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Gbr. 3).
Physical SARS-CoV-2 is most unknowable.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and the humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar quality.
Reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, etanol 75%, disfected with clorine, aisation acid, chloform acroform, and other fatte, but not chlorhreceddin, effective activates the virus.
In general, the whole human population has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and because it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Right now, there's no detailed study reporting about the immunology response to SARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only refer to another CoV research earlier, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
Generally, after invading inangs, the virus is known by the immune system via a pattern-encolumn prescription recipe (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RG-Ilike receptor (RR).
Through different tracks, viruses educate the expression of inflamatory factor, dendritetic cells maturation, and interpheretic synthesis of the I type (IFN) that restricts the spread of virus and accelerates the virus antigen by the makrofag.
However, protein N on SARS-CoV can help prevent immun responses.
Soon, the immutable responses joined in the battle against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
T CD4+ cells initiate B cells to produce specific antibodies against virus, and T CD8+ cells kill virus infected directly.
The T-helper cells produce proinflamatoric sytokin to help protect the cell.
Nevertheless, CoV can impede T cell function by educating the apotosis of T cell.
humoral immunity, which includes complexity, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also important in resistant virus infections.
For example, an antibody is isolated from a healthy patient neutralizing MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immun reactions result in a large number of radicals locally free, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failing the comemic organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection marked with awit clan clan, more about age with arbitrary disease and pregnant woman.
Generally, people who exposed the virus in large amounts or whose immun functions are interrupted have a greater chance of infection than anyone else.
The average SARS-CoV-2 period estimate is 1-14 days, most of 3-7 days based on study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases showed that an average inkububation period was 3 days and ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as explained above, indicates that the immunity period of 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days are based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adapt time effective based on the most accurate immunity period that prevents people from infected, but without symptoms, transmits viruses to others.
As a common precinct, people exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often a major and early symptoms of COVID-19, with or without any other symptoms such as dry coughs, pauses, muscle pains, limbs, headaches, throataches, rinoreas, chest pain, diare, nausea, and vomit.
Some patients have a dispnea and/or hyphosemia a week after an ailment.
In severe cases, the progress of patients ’ disease goes fast into acute respiratory syndrome, syoks of aptic, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopathic coagulopathy.
A patient who has a fever and/or the symptoms of breathing and acid fever, even though without the diagnostic disorder, has to be filtered against the virus for early diagnostics.
The demographic Studi at the end of December 2019 indicates that the percentage of symptoms is 98% for fever, 76% for dry coughs, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings are reported in two recent studies, which are studies on family clasters and clans that are due to the transmission of asthmatics.
Compared to that, the 2012 demographic study shows that patients MERS-CoV also have fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dispnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with MERS's power higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) are also observed on MERS patients.
On SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry rocking (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diare (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) is shown as major symptoms and ventilation support required for about 14%%%% of patients.
Up to February 14, COVID-19 mortality is 2% with a verified case reaching 66.576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, death is 37% of 2.494 cases confirmed.
The previous study reported that RARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 heights of trust intervals (CI) 95% is 5,7-7,23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only circular to 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in the matter of symptoms, mortality, and R0 was given at Table 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread skills than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as disable as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is bigger than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandem.
Clever ossuary is often found in a family or from a group or a vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have a travel history or live in Wuhan or other adjacent areas or have contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the twitch.
However, it is reported that one can carry a virus without showing symptoms of more than two weeks, and patients returned from the hospital can bring another virus, and this leads to an alertness to increasing time of quantine.
At the early stage, patients have the count of the perifer white blood cells (us of which limfosit) is normal or down.
For example, the limfopenia with the count of white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes the count of limfosit < 1×109/L, and the increased ascreation rate of aminotransferase and viremia found at 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
Heart rates and muscles and mioglobins increase in the blood of a number of patients, and C-reactive proteins and blood rates increase in most of the patients.
On patients with heavy cases, the D-dimer rate increases, that is the product of the fibrin reconstruction in the blood, and the count of limfosits decreases progressively.
The toraks photo disorder was found in large acids of COVID-19 patients and marked with a clouded shadow or ground-glass in the lung.
Patients often experience thin pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acid syndrome.
When the ARDS happened, unhandled inflammation, immunition fluids, and progressive fibrosis intensified gas exchange disorders.
The pneumocation of the type I and the second type lowered the surplus rate and increased the pressure of the surface so that it lowered the lung ability to expand and increased the risk of lung colaps.
Therefore, the worst findings in the rocket photos are often paralleled with the worst of the disease rates.
On February 18, 2020, the first patologies COVID-19 indicated pneumocation decimalation, formation of hialin membrane, and infiltration of limfosit interscistal limphis, and psychic cells in the lungs of patients who died from this disease, according to the virus infection patologies and ARDS and similar to the SARS and MERS patologis.
RNA RNA SARS-CoV-2 Detected by the reaction of the back polymerase chain transcriptase (RT-PCR) used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnoses.
However, because of the height of a fake negative level, which can speed up the epidemi, clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnostics (that are no longer depending only on RT-PCR) at Tiongkok 13 February 2020.
The same situation happened to the SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, the combination between illness history, clinical manifestation, laboratory tests, and radiation discoveries are essential and a need to make effective diagnostics.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang group explained the protocol of SHRLOCK-based techniques using a copy of SARS-CoV-2, which detects the RARS-CoV-sectic RARV fragment at 20 × 10-18 molecle/L to 200 × 10-18 lp/L (10-100 copy of input units) using spool in less than an hour without a complicated instrument.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if it is verified on clinic samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new CoV, the doctor especially offers support for COVID-19 patients, as long as trying various therapies that have been used or proposed earlier for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Tabel.2).
This therapy includes the currently available therapy and the potential therapy with antivirus drugs, imunosupressions, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicines, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of healed patients is proposed for use in therapy.
The farming company has developed antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stage, SARS-CoV-2 is especially attacking lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, like gastrointestinal and kidneys.
However, the displacement and respiratory failing are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is vital to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with heavy breathing symptoms must be supported with extracorporum membran oxygen (ECMO), which is the most modified cardiopulmoner shortcuts used for heart failure or respiratory treatment.
Besides, electrolit balance care, prevention and secondary infection treatment and sycamore sycamore, and vital organ function protection is also vital for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Overwhelmed immune system reactions led to sytokin storms on SARS and MERS patients.
The sitokin hurricane is the form of the systemic inflamatory response that is marked by a serial release degling of sytokin, which includes TFBER, IL-1 Affairs, IL-2, IL-6, IFN
These sytokin-stokins are inducing the immun cells to release a large amount of free radicals that are the main cause of the ARDS and fails the coemuk organs.
Imunosucy is very important in cytokin storming, especially on severe patients.
Corticsteroids and Tocilizumabs, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodi, have been used to handle sitokin storms.
Other imunosupression for sytokin storms includes the immune response modules that T cells are directed by T; the IFN-DD, IL-1, and NF; inhibition JAK; blinatumomab; detecting sytokin signals 4; and inhibitor HDAC.
Steroid, as an imunosupres, is used in SARS treatment to reduce inflammatory damage.
However, steroids on high doses are useless for heavy lung injury on SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonicross, which have a profound effect on prognosis.
Even so, a short corticsteroid delivery in low doses until it is encouraged to be carefully given to critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of this survey writing, no effective antivirus therapy was confirmed.
However, intravena remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, found nutritious to an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of the disease caused by the Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, the remdesivir also showed inhibition to other single RNA viruses, which include the MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for Tiongkok to do a series of tests on the SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the result is highly anticipated.
Besides, baricitinb, interferon- tape, lopinavir/ritonavir, and onvirins have been recommended as a potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomit, damage, and other side reactions can happen after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other medications that the patient must be carefully monitored.
Plasma of a healthy patient and antibody creation
There is a long history of the collecting of the patient’s blood from a contagious disease to treat other patients who are suffering from the same disease or to prevent people from being affected by the disease.
True, a healthy patient often has a relatively high rate of antibodies in his blood.
Antibodi is imunoglobulin (Ig) produced limfosit B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in the pathogen, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, the plasma is collected from a group of patients who have been healed from COVID-19 and is injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their wave improves in 24 hours, accompanied by reduction in inflammation and viral loads and increased oxygen units in blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done to file that method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition to its terapeutic effect, some of the failings associated with plasma are to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can sitokin's immune responses in excess and cause sytokin release syndrome, which is a potential toxicity that threatens the soul.
Antibodies are usually low and plasma is required in large amounts to care for critical patients.
The expansion and the production of specific antibodis fast enough to resist global epidemics difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from a healthy patient and identify the genetic code that gives effective antibodis or perform effective antibodi filters against proteins that are essential to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibodi production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
But the effect is largely dependent on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most effective components are not yet known or unknown because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, since the effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not available, TCM is one of the main alternatives for patients with mild symptoms or for people who recover from heavy disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du's capsul Lian Hua Qing Wen was found useful for COVID-19 therapy.
The top duration level in COVID-19 patients' therapy is observed in some Chinese provinces that use TCM at 87% patients, which include Gansu (63,7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei provinces, which use TCM only at 30% COVID-19 patients, has a lowest rate (13%).
Yet, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and the severity of the patient, have to be included in evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends introduced a study that compared western medicine therapy (WM) only with the combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time it takes for body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and the mosquito is much shorter in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
That's more impressive, the rate of the detection of the symptoms (from light to weight) is much lower to the WM+TCM group than the WM group only (7,4% than 46,2%) and mortality is lower to WM+TCM group than WM only (8,8%).
Even so, effectiveness and TCM security are still waiting for better control tests on larger scale and in more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to identify the work mechanism and explain effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 were very afraid of a very contagious disease and even letting this down, and people who were caused to experience sense of boredness, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypocrisy, and coughing and the side effects of therapy such as insomnia as corticsteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early phase of the SARS plague, a series of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, emergency, panic attacks, accommodators, psychotic symptoms, delinquency, and even suicides have been reported.
The tracking of contact and quantines are mandatory, as part of the public's health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the infection, karantina, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided for COVID-19 patients, people who are expected, and people who are in contact with them, and those in need of public society.
Psychological support must include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, the clear communication with routine and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and the plan of therapy and professional electronic devices to avoid contact with each other.
The effective vaccine is vital to unloading the transmission chain of the animal reservoir and the human being infected to the vulnerable inangs and is often equipped with antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemics caused by the appearance of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccine, which is a long and effective antibodis of extraction and/or immunity that protects SARS-CoV.
For the SARS, the vaccine is weakened has been evaluated on experimental animals.
Even so, effectiveize in the vaccines of vaccines to older age and its lethal challenges and protection against zoonotic virus infections must still be determined before clinic studies begin.
It's probably because the SARS stopped 17 years ago and no new case reported since then.
On the contrary, the case sporadis and the MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because of the ongoing zoonotic source in the endemic area.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MERS by using unactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nano particles, viruslike particles, and subunits of recombial proteins and some have been evaluated on experiments.
A vaccine development against the safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-imuns is a very urgent and vital task to control an epidemic in progress.
But this difficulty is not easy to overcome because it is a long time to develop vaccine (at least 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show his full clinical journey on thousands of patients.
For most of the case, patients can heal without a succulent.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with morbidity and mortality high to patients with heavy cases.
Therefore, the formation of the prognosis of disease is essential for health care to give priority to its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on a clinical study that has been reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with COVID-19 patients prognosis (Table 3):
Age: The age is the most important factor for the SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 was especially happening at the age of 30-65 with 47,7% of patients above 50 years in studies containing 8.866 cases as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have a syringe and complications and signify age older than patients who don't need intensive care (at 66-year-old age than 51), which signals age as a predictive factor for the end of COVID-19 patients.
The sexy type: SARS-CoV-2 is more infecting men than women (0,31/100,000 over 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Prorbidity and complications: Patient COVID-19 that needs intensive care has probably more likely to experience acid and arithmic heart injury.
A heart event is also a major reason for death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 reported can also be viable with colangiosit with ACE2-positives, which can cause the heart displacement of COVID-19 patients.
It is to be noted that age and a basic illness are highly coordinated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory discovery: C-reactive protein rates in blood reflect inflammation severity or tissue injuries and are proposed as a predictable factor for disease, reactions to therapy, and final recovery.
The Korelation between the CRP rate and the insecurity and the prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, the increase in dehidrogenase latitude (LDH), the aminotransferase asparty, aminotransferase alanin (ALT), and the kinase creation (CK) can also help predict the result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and were released during tissue damage.
That's why these enzymes are traditional markers of heart and heart.
Major clinical symptoms: Photos of toraks and the development of temporary clinic symptoms must be considered together to predict the end results and CAVID-19 complications.
The use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are imunosupressions that are often used as ventilator therapy for infections to reduce the severity of inflamatory damage.
Because high dose of corticoids are used to severe SARS patients, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer osteonecrosis avascular disabilities and bad quality of life.
That's why, if necessary, steroids must be used in low doses and short-term in COVID-19 patients.
mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreaks, many patients have suffered tremendous stress because they have to experience long - term quantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
The psychological consumption and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different picture of epidemiology than SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory channel, SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently replicated in the upper respiratory channel and cause light symptoms or no symptoms in the early infection phases, similar to other CoVs that cause pileks.
Therefore, at an early stage or infectious time, patients can produce a large number of viruses during daily activities, which create great difficulty in control of epidemics.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission was believed to be when patients were severely ill and most did not occur in the early stage.
Thus, the COVID-19 plague is far more severe and hard to control than the SARS plague.
Currently, great effort is being done in Tiongkok, which includes the quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and quarantines in almost the entire population with the hope of venting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Even though this action is very damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients decreases, indicating the delay of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimation of the plague would end in March and the decline phase lasted for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not asoptimis.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems much more contagious than SARS, won't end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. makes a model for predicting the end of epidemi and asserts that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian researchers group reported that SARS-CoV-2 detected in the middle-concautions and the obsolete of patients who were cured and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier, it indicated that the virus that was identified back can be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
Even so, the promised signs occur in Tiongkok, if it is seen by the amount of new cases, which indicates that the current strategy may work.
The re-predicted ebola will cause a million cases with half also deaths.
However, with quantine and strict isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens his ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus not too patogen that can affect humans.
Compared to COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transfer through coughs or grenades, and maybe through direct contact with materials that are contaminated by the virus.
This virus was found also in the feces so that it emits new transmissions, which is a feces-ke-mulut transmission.
The recent study of 138 reports that 41% cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be done to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even people who happen to contact with patients or infected people.
The first defense can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of the facial masker, both the surgeon mask and the N95 respiratory mask (the number of the 1860s) helped control the spread of the virus.
Surgeons keep the brushing of a potentially infected person not inhaled air or attached to the surface of the material, where the moltening can be passed to others.
However, just the N95 mask (number series 1860s) can protect against viral inhalation with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% vison can evaluate completely; SARS-CoV-CoV is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both measure about 85 nm.
Because the particles can monitor even five surgeon masks that are assigned to one, the health care provider who deals directly with patients must wear N95 (the series of 1860s) and not the surgeon masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers have to wear an appropriate isolation garment to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing the N95 mask; the virus might get into his body through the eyebeat.
Therefore, health caregivers also have to wear eyebrows or glasses as long as they work with patients.
For the public community in a crowded area or a potentially packed, it is highly suggested that each person wash his hands with soaps with more often than always, try to stay in the house with a self-infected karantina, and avoid contact with people who have potential potentially infected.
The three-foot distances are believed to be suitable to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, his high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a great warning for the Chinese who have a strong memory of the SARS plague in 2003.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center of Disease Control calms the people by saying that this new virus has a low preaching attitude and a limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and preventing and requisition of this disease is not a problem.
This message is very soothing to the fear of society, especially when the entire country is preparing the seasonal Festival, so this critical time is delayed to contain small - scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Tiongkok should take lessons from this and make great improvement in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noted by the citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) more sensitive and reactive to information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) much more restricting the potential for epidemics at the early stage, and instead of trying to calm the public; and (4) more often issue the effective training to improve public awareness of the disease and test the system periodic responses.
The COVID-19 plague was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to strike at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread across the Chinese and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because these viruss are very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS symptoms are similar, the COVID-19 outbreaks give a impression like the SARS outbreak returned.
However, there are some clear difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is very important to control an epidemic and handle patients.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, as well as the age rate of deaths than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19,91% than 1,44%.
Patient COVID-19 transmits the virus even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they are seriously ill, this makes a greater difficulty in blocking COVID-19 spread than SARS.
This explains some reason SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA base to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can have a positive effect on virus checking.
This finding greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some important problems still have to be solved, which is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Even though the genetic homology was found up to 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two co-like-SARS bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the bat.
What animal is the species of intermediate to reflect the virus from the original inang, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't hack the transmission effectively and the plague can reclaim every second.
Although molecular modifications and biochemical acids indicate that SARS-CoV-2 areriking with ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into a breath channel cell and cause further patology change?
Is this virus efficient with a cell that expresses ACE2 on other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot reach a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How has the virus developed genetically during human transmission?
Is this pandemic going to be the world's pandemic, ending like SARS, or recreating periodically again like a flu?
The answers to the questions above and many other statements are important, but it may take time to find them.
Nevertheless, no matter how much we cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to get back to normal life.
The origin of the zoonotic human crown virus
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have moved the crown virus co-evolves (CoV) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoV (HcoV) had been known to cause minor illness, such as the cereal.
The heavy acute syndrome syndrome (SARS) and the Central Eastern respiratory syndrome reverses the state and reveals how HCoV infections can be very destructive and threatening.
The cover of SARS-CoV-2 in the central Tiongkok in the late 2019 has made CoV a retrieval and surprised us with a high transmission, but with a lower patogenisity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
The HCoV infection is zoonosis, so the original HCoV zootic understanding will benefit us.
Most of the HCoV is from bats, on these animals, the virus is not patogenic.
The Inang reservoir intermediate of some HCoV has also been known.
Animal identification has direct implications in prevention of human disease.
CoV-inang interaction can also give an important view of CoV's patógenesis to humans.
In this survey, we present a common picture of seven HCoVs, with focus on the history of his discovery and his zoonotics and his interspesies transmission.
The important thing is, we compare and contrast the HCoV from an evolutionary point of view and genome restruction.
CoV 2019 disease epidemia (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the successive conditions of inang transition and immobilize the evolution of viruses in disease parade are also hidden.
The crown virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a bunch of varieties of the RNA virus, a positive syndrome, and single-haired.
This virus has the biggest genome with 26 to 32 kilobasa in between the RNA virus called "CoV", because his morphology is like a crown under electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CoV has an uncompressed genome that has a similar boarding.
About two thirds of the genome consist of two large open read frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) each other is overridden. Both aretranslated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Poliprotein has further procession to form 16 nonstructional proteins, called nsp1~16.
The genome remains of open read frame (ORF) for structure proteins, which include tons or spikes (S), circumferences or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nuleoprotein (N).
A number of specific complement proteins for a certain line of descent are also accompanied by various C.E. lineages of CoV.
Based on the differences of proteins, CoV classified into four genuss (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); between these four, beta-CoV genuss have most HCoV and are divided into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that bats and pets are gene sources most of the alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the birds are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has constantly crossed species barriers and some CoV has been an important pathogen to humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs known.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoV covers HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, heavy acid syndrome syndrome (SARS-CoV), Central Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually causes light symptoms, like pileks and/or diare.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very patogenic, causing the lower dropout infections to be relatively more patients and have higher opportunities to develop into acute respirator disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation outside organs.
The first HCoV-229E Strain, B814, issolated from the inch of patients that are intersected in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through a deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both causes the symptoms of their own recovery.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are usually harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS plague that happened in 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in the history of today, which infects more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate about 10%.
Ten years later, Central Eastern breathing syndrome (MERS) caused an epidemic continued in the Arabian Peninsula by spreading spores to other parts of the world.
HCoV's new 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is next called SARS-CoV-2, is an agent yousatif the viral disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91.000 people to 3 March 2020.
Alarm's already ringing and the world has to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic coming.
Seven HCoVs all have a zoonotic origin of bats, rats, or pets.
A lot of evidence supports the origin of evolution of all the HCoV from bats, in bats, CoV is well-approved and nonpatogenic, but it shows a huge genetic diversity.
19 COVID Epidemic has brought medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to Chinangkok and the whole world.
The HCoV zoonotic track gave a job frame to understand the natural history, the alarm power, and the limitation factor of the transfer between species.
This study can also drive or facilitate the search for the reservoir animals, the intermediate, and the modifications of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implicacions in the future of preaching prevention.
In this survey, we gave a general picture of the origin of zoonotics, transmision betweenspesies, and HCoV patógenesis.
We specially focus and discuss the common topic that the HCoV parent virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservoir, but become a patogenic patogen after the interspesies transmission to the new inang.
We also comment on the HCoV evolutional trend that transminition increases often accompanied by patogenisity reduction.
The end results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics are also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E B814 strain was first of the insect patients, various CoV had been disolved from various infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief record of HCoV discovery in chronology sequence (Tabel 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-229E Strain was isolated from the patient's breathing channel that had an upper respiratory infection in 1966, which was next bribed to grow in the WI-38 lung cell.
The patient that is infected by HCoV-229E shows the symptoms of celema, which include headaches,sins, lesues, and throataches, with fevers and coughs seen on 10~20% case.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a organ cult and a serial line in the still sucking brain.
Clinic infections of HCoV-OC43 seem to be similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E, which are symmatically infected by other respiratory pipe infections like influenza A and rhinovirus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 spread all over the world and tend to be most transferred during the winter in the middle of the irony.
Usually, the immunity of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by the illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy person who is infected with HCoV-229E has a light selesma.
Just a few patients with the immune systim of the body that is weakening indicating heavy underpast infections.
SARS, also known as "stick pneumonia", is a pandemic due to the first HCoV that is well documented in human history and ethical agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the late 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The SARS Epidemic has resulted in 8.096 cases reported by 774 deaths, which are widespread in many countries and continents.
Despite superularulars, every case is estimated can cause about two secondary cases, with a time of immunity 4 to 7 days and the top of the viral loads visible on the 10th day of disease.
The patient that is infected by SARS-CoV was beginning to suffer mialgia, headaches, fever, lesu, and grievances, followed by dispnea, cough, and respiratory disorders as further symptoms.
Limfopenia, an unusual heart function test, and the growth of kinase creatin is a common laboratory disorder on SARS.
The damage to alveolar, the epitel cell prolific prolifency, and the growth of macrofag is also terorized in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower breathing channel, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by sitokin storms, which can cause death, especially to patients whose immune is weak.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy family of zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, an enormous effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7 months of the Netherlands in the late 2004.
The virus was originally very common to young, old, and poor patients who suffered from respiratory disease.
Coriza depictions, cults, fevers, and bronkiolitis are commonly found on diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent Studi explained the same virus isolation from 8 months old male specimen who had pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it's identified in the Netherlands, this virus actually spread across the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4,7% general respiratory disease and the peak of its incidents took place at the start of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringitis, which is also called crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been in charge of pneumonia and bronkiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronkiolitis community, HCoV-HKU1 reported to be related to acid acid.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found all over the world, causing light respiratory disease.
These four HCoV communities have all been adapted to humans and generally have a small possibility of being a very patogen disease.
Generally, when we get the ability to move efficiently and keep ourselves in the human body, this HCoV virulity and patogen is also declining.
MERS-CoV was first solated in 2012 from 60-year-old patient lungs who suffered acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases of the laboratory are confirmed from the Middle East, the import cases of the subway spread to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
The other secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
The MERS Clinic Manifestation is similar to the SARS clinic manifestation, which is characterized by a progressive monia.
Unlike the SARS, many MERS patients have also suffered skinless kidney failures, which are only on MERS among the diseases that HCoV.
Over 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, like diarrhea and vomit.
Up to February 14 of 2020, over 2500 cases confirmed by the laboratory were reported with a high case death, which is 34,4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening virus known to humans.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, pneumonia patient clans that rerocutically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in Wuhan, Province Hubei, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the outbreak of the underlying subway infection and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Global Health Emergency and named the COVID-19.
Up to March 320, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the number of severe cases at 3,4%.
It has to be recorded, the death of the case at Hubei, Tiongkok, at 4,2%, while the death of the case outside Hubei is 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 caused heavy breathing infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with fever, cough, and packed breath.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most heavy symptoms and can develop quickly into the syndrome of acute breathing disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high nucleotides sequence homology, the size of 82%, they're both crumbled into different phylogenetic tree branches.
SARS-CoV-2 Patogonistics clearly lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infected subject has been reported and may have been involved in the quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs show a very interesting equation and differences.
First, the time of inkubnation and the duration of the HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed the general trend of six other HCoV.
Second, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (specially HcoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more commonly visible picture in Community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of light - nonspecific symptoms or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the case of COVID-19 can look like a SARS-CoV infection even with a little lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarity with community HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills are at least as high as HCoV community.
On the other hand, it's not that SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills after some course on humans still need to be verified, as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV case.
Last, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the feses sample.
"Is SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission important, as in case of SARS-CoV transmissions, at least in a certain situation, it still needs to be clarified by further study."
Also important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 are seasonal like in the case of a community HCoV.
In any case, SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmation skills, patogenity, and spread continues in some routes on humans, will have a great impact on the fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCoV communities that cause light symptoms all have adapted to humans.
Seen from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be the species of ancient HCoV pandemics.
The HOV that caused heavy disease on humans and the heavy HCoV is destroyed.
In order for this to happen, the HCoV has to replicate in humans in enough amounts to allow adaptive mutations to start against the inang limitation factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more infected people, the greater the possibility of this virus being fully adapted to human beings.
If the virus is properly adapted, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quantine or other infection control steps.
For many years, four communities of CoV were scattered in human populations and triggered concrete on people who were immunompetent.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV who are very patogenics have not adapted to humans and their transmissions in humans can't be sustained.
Both have to defend themselves and reproductive in zoonotic reservoir and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or some intermediate and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transfer like a community HCoV, at least right now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more patogenic than HCoV community and not as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Still must be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will be adapted full of humans and circulation in humans without a reservoir or intercessors.
Before discussing the origin of the HCoV animal, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary inangs, naturals, reservoirs, intermediates, and HCoVmplifications.
Animals act as the HCoV evolutionary inspirator if they have a close ancestor and share high homology in the nucleotide security level.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpatogenic in this inch.
In the same way, the reservoir could carry HCoV on the course and in the long run.
In these two cases, the Indian is infected naturally and is a natural inch for HCoV or the mother virus.
On the other hand, if the HCoV just entered an intermediate right before or around the time of the virus into humans, the virus has not been adapted with the new inang and is often patogenic.
This intermediate can work as a source of human infections zoonotic and plays as an intruder by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to simplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can have a buntu infection if he can't keep his transmission in the intermediate.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt with intermediate intel and even cause long - term endemis.
In this case, the intermediate can become a natural reservoir.
The epidemiology data revolves that the SARS zero case has contact history with the hunter.
Investigation of the seroprevalent further indicates that the owner of the animal has an anti-SARG prevalence higher than the general population.
Moon mounds (The larvata Dog in the live animal market) are the first to be identified with a virtually identification of SARS-CoV virus.
Indirectly, it is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the mobs in the market were killed.
Yet, it is said that the moon's mosquito of the wildlife, or the ranging of the animals that are not exposed to it, most of the tests for the SARS-CoV; this indicates that the moon's musang may act as a interchangement, but not the natural resorrepresents of SARS-CoV.
It has to be recorded, since 80% of the various animals on the Guangzhou market has anti-SARS-CoV antibodi, it can't be issued that there may be many small mammal species also work as the SARS-CoV interministrator.
All this inang seems to be the end of SARS-CoV.
A natural animal inang search of SARS-CoV next reveals the nearby bat CoV, which is called the Rhinolopus C.O.C.S. HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located on the Tiongkok horse tapal bat.
This bat gave a positive test for the anti-SARS-CoV antibodi and the SARSV genome SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This CoV and the other bat CoV shares the nucleotide nucleotide's nucleotide 88-92% with the SARS-CoV.
The Studi is the foundation for the new concept that bats are inangs for the new human pathogens.
Some like CoV-SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from bats, but only one, given the name WIV1, can besolved as a living virus.
A known angiotension enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a SARS-CoV receptionor.
WIV1 of the bat fes samples shown using ACE2 bats, musangs, and humans as a receptionor to enter the cell.
Interesting thing, the serum of convalent SARS patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in the bat, with nucleotide security homology of 95%.
Despite the height of homology between these two viruss, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a live parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not a live CARS-CoV reservoir.
Phylogenetic analysis merges MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same inang recipe, which is a peptil diptidase 4 (DPP4), as a viral entrance.
Secuens of RNA polymerase depended-RNA MERS-CoV phylogenetic is closer to the match of the co-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV has been found in the wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest relative of CoV-Hku25 bats only share 87% of nucleotida security homology.
That's why bats may not be the live reservoir MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that the Arab camel has produced the psychiatrist for a specific antibodi that neutralizes MERS-CoV, just like a Middle Eastern camel in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical with the virus found in humans is isolated from the Arab camel's soup, this indicates more that camel is the real reservoir in the MERS-CoV.
It's also important to note that massive virus bullets with symptoms that are usually lightened on experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It has to be recorded, the infected camel is a virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus bullets from the bat.
Even so, questions have not been answered because many cases of MERS confirmed have no contact with camels before symptoms, the possibility of human transmissions or unknown transmision routes involving unknown species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 share 96,2% of nucleotid homology with the CoV bat of the 13th of Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, security differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to set the parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the live reservoir SARS-CoV-2, unless CoV bats are almost identically found later.
It's possible that the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals are among the species of wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Grosir, many of the early cases that COVID-19 is associated with this market, which indicates the possibility of a animal-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic security show that a group of small mammals who are threatened to be lost, known as the trenches, may also carry the beta-CoV-CoV-2 associated with the SARS.
This new CoV trenggiling Genom shares 85-92% of nucleotide security homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is related to RaTG13 with the equality of 90% at the nucleotide security level.
Both are grouped into two virus subgaris like SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic tree, one of the shares of prescriptives binding domains (RBD) that are more like SARS-CoV-2, with the similarity amino acid acidity of 97,4%.
That's significant, the RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more different, even though the homology level is as close as the whole genome is higher.
The previous study at the sick trenches also reported the virus detection of the lungs, which turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of dissolution and manual currency to produce parsial genes that consist of about 86,3% complete virus genome.
We can't deny the possibility of trenggling as one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals.
But now there's no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 from a live bargain because the security differences between SARS-CoV-2 and my-SARS-CoV-2 relatives.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and coV-coV relatives.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary line on the bats, the trenches, and the other mammals must still be set up.
Even though the highest security homology on the RBD was found between SARS-CoV-CoV family-SARS-CoV-2 trenggling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology level at the entire genom.
It's too speculative if it's said that the height of flickering between CBDs-CoARS-CoV-2 trenggling and SARS-CoV-2 is moved by the evolution of a selective convergen.
Hypothesis of the negotiation supports the reconstruction between my-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 trenggling and RaTG13 species of wild animals.
As a factor in the evolutionary alarm, the recombination is a lot going on between beta-CoV.
The researchers have not yet been able to decide about the origin of zootic SARS-CoV-2.
Besides very patogenic HCoV-229E zoontic, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be from CoV kelewar, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1's original virus has been found in the lawn animals.
Reported that CoV bat is called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the third-colored bat of North America indicates the servitude close to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically associated with another CoV bat, with Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, who was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae was also thought to be the intermediate.
To make it clear, the current knowledge of the origin of the known HCoV animals in Pictures 1 and Tabel 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of a transmision between the HCoVsies in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species of cattle to infect humans, recorded a pandemic respiratory infection.
HCoV-229E transmision history is not too clear.
The bat-CoV alpha that's related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them, there's an alpaka alpha-CoV.
Some evidence support direct virus transmission from bats to humans.
First, man, not the alpaka, who may be dealing with bats in the same ecological browse.
Instead, man has a close contact with the alpaka.
Secondly, the bat-CoV alpha that ranging with HCoV-229E has a variety of kinds and nonpatogenics in the bats, while alfa-CoV alpaka caused a respiratory plague on infected animals.
Last time, alpaka alpha-CoV was not found in a feral animal.
That's why, the alpaka may have the alpha-CoV family-HCoV-229E of the human beings couldn't be banished.
In fact, bat is a direct source of human patogen virus, which includes the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
That's why, it's not surprising that bats might immediately transfer HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while the bat-CoV alpha works as the HCoV-229E gene barricade, the Arab alpaka and unta may work as the intermediate intermediate that transmits the virus to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for the transmission of the interspesies from the bat to the Arab camel and from the Arab camel to man.
The origin of evolutionary MERS-CoV of bats was known at the early identification of the virus and also reinforced with the discovery after.
Obviously, bats are a rich species of viruses to exchange genetic fragments betweenspesies and interspesies transmissions.
The long age, the colony of closeness, the close social interaction, and the strong flying ability, all is the condition that supports the bats to become the ideal virus plant.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has been adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate in the stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV caused a very lighty disease and maintained a relatively low-sighted mutation speed in this animal.
The transmission that spounts to humans happened by chance and humans are still the end of the MERS-CoV because the transmission can't continue.
Not like the camel role in MERS-CoV transmission, trenggling role, if there is, in different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Especially, the patogenic patriotic beta-CoV is very patogenic in the trenching.
Tenggling may be the final inangs for the SARS-CoV-son family of SARV-2, similar to the musangs in the SARS-CoV case.
In the next study, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans must be calculated or dismissed.
First of all, bats could be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 family virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Man can share ecological relungs with bats through trade or coal mining.
Secondly, trenggling could be one of the interternative accounts for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that just entered.
Humans have a virus through trade and hunting meat consumer.
Maybe, many mammals, including pets, rent on SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies surveys of pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, reconstruction and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that sit on both bats and trenches.
The original search of the SARS-CoV-2 animal is still going on.
Despite the variety of animals, three major factors from the side of the virus are also important to make CoV easier across species barriers.
First of all, his relatively high mutation speed in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-handed RNA virus, CoV mutation speeds can be considered "sedang" to "height" with the average substitution rates of ~10-4 per year per base, depending on CoV adaptation phases of new inang.
CoV has an exorrucular exaggeration, extermination that causes very high mutility, inevitation, or even inviability.
Interesting thing, the nulog Remdesivir is known to press CoV's replication through this extractorual nuclease and RNA polimerase-speed.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical experiments.
Even so, CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the mutation of the Indian mutation.
Besides, mutation speed is often high when CoV hasn't adapted with the inangs.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation speed, SARS-CoV-2 mutation speed is actually lower, signaling higher adaptation rates with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another inch that's close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to an Arab camel.
Theoretically, theotically, the odds that the genetic glowing will quickly make vaccine and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 become ineffective.
Secondly, the big RNA genome in CoV gave extra flexibility in genome modifications, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of the interspesies, which was useful to appear a new CoV when the conditions were appropriate.
This is supported by a number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are printed toward the end of the 3 genome.
Third, CoV frequently alters the template during the RNA replication through the unique "choo-salin" mechanism.
In the sun that works as a mixing container, the camel change is often happening during the RNA CoV transcryption.
A complete RNA and a very homologous subgenomic can experience recombines to form a new CoV.
The natural reconstruction phylogenetic evidence has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, so is CoV like SL-CoV bat and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus interactions in connection with transmissions
Besides the three virus factors mentioned above, virus interaction with the inang recipe is another major factor that affects interspesies transmission.
Here, the reconstruction of SARS-CoV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the transminition of interspesies.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV of humans and musangs, SARS-CoV was expected to have a quick adaptation in various rows, especially with mutations on S protein RBD.
Generally, the S CoV protein RBD interacts with the cell receptors and intensively become the target of the response of the inang antibodi.
At SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318 amino acid to the 510th of the S1 fragment, which deals with the ACE2 human and the sensor as the viral path.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 reseptors of various animals, which include bats, musangs, rats, and dogs, to enable interpesies virus transmission.
In fact, only six amino acid residues that are observed different between the viruses of human and the musangs in the RBD and 4 of them are located on the motive of a receptionor's binding for interaction with ACE2 recipeors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N mutation and S487T in his RBD, which may increase the affinity of the protein connections with human ACE2 recipes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be essential to adapting virus to humans.
It has to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell reception as SARS-CoV.
Differences of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 S proteins units implementing affinity of SC2 protein binding is likely to change.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the finite human ACE2 binding and SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between humans and SARS-CoV proteins.
Also important to know is whether there are other correspondents that may be necessary for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission..
Interesting thing, HCoV-NL63 is also arikation with ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There's a lot of other HCoV recipes, like aminoptadase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-a.teracy acid for HCoV-OC43.
These reseptors may also play in the success of CoV adaptation in humans after the interspesies transmission from the inang.
In addition to cell reception, the end of HCoV transmissionses is also arranged by dependence factors and other inang restrictions.
This inang protein differs between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and pets can be a barrier to interspesies transmission.
The HCoV has to take over the dependence of the inang and blocking the inang limitation factor to succeed in interspesies transmission.
In this case, molecular detectors in the field of vital virus interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
The whole genome filter is unreligious to see the dependencies and limitation of SARS-CoV-2 insurgent CRISPR technology may be useful.
The new HCoV creation: back to the start of the plague
CoV bat's diversity gave a big chance to appear a new HCoV.
In this case, the bat CoV works as a HCoV gen lug.
In addition, quick mutation and genetic renovation also prompted HCoV evolution and functioned as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new protein injection genes can be a potentially modification of virus fenotipes dramatically.
Among SARS-CoV protein accessories, ORF8 is expected to play vitally in adaptation to humans because the SARS-CoV-CoV-ssolved virus is found in various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a special feature of the removal of 29 nucleotida was found on the seizures that weresolved at the beginning of human epidemia.
This elimination separates ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be adaptive mutation that supports the change inang.
Besides, SARS-CoV may have a recombination history with an alpha-CoV line and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller identification areas of RNA polymerase that depend on RNA.
The reconstruction location is also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and part of nsp14.
In the same way, the reconstruction of various offspring was shown on the MERS-CoV epidemic, which happened in the Arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombinament event has also been observed on another HCoV where HCoV has reconstruction with another CoV animal in his nonstructure gene.
It must also be alert to the fact that artificial selection can play in an accidental change in viral genome, likely resulting in the release of virus from the infection, such as the immune system.
The example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 complete on the HCoV-229E prototype of the removal of two nucleotides.
While the entire ORF4 can be observed on the bat virus and camels that are amid with HCoV-229E, alfa-CoV alpaka alpha shows a single nucleotida insertion that leads to a frame shift.
Finally, new HCoV evolution was also moved by the pressure of selection in the reservoir.
A light wave or no symptoms detected when the bat was infected by CoV, which indicates adaptation between CoV and bat.
It seems that bats are properly adapted to CoV anatomy and physiology.
For example, disabilities on the proinfluencing response to bats will lower CoV's efficient patology.
In addition, natural murder cells activity on bats were pressed by the rise of the reguration of a natural contractor of NKG2/CD94 killer cell and the rate of complex histocompatibility of the low-class class.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) from high metabolic activity of bats can press CoV replication and affect the reorruclease by exorruclease, thus giving the pressure of selection for highly patogenetic virus strain creation when it enters into the new inang.
A more patogenic Strain may also develop through the recombinar, which leads to obtaining new proteins or protein features for inang adaptation.
That's why, it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpatogenic or causes light symptoms in his reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV is strongly replicated without triggering a strong immun response.
It's where the secrets are the bearers without symptoms and the cause of heavy cases in human infections.
Threats are particularly due to excessive immunity responses and sitokin storms, with increased lung damage that is heavier if the immune responses are getting stronger.
Instead, on the bearer without symptoms, the immun response is out of the CoV replication.
The same strategy to disconnect immun responses may be useful in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responds are especially strong on bats.
That's why, interferons type I, at least at the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans, should be useful.
Besides, the NLRP3 inflammation in the bat is defensive.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2's intelligence follows the general route of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the bat-CoV beta-CoV which shares 95% nucleotid homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also CoV bats that share 96% of nucleotides homologi with SARS-CoV-2.
Even though the musangs and other animals on the market were found carrying identical viruses with SARS-CoV, live intermediatees for SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
Beta-CoV trenggiling very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that the trenching may play as one of the intermediate or CoV trenggiling lines may contribute to the end version of SARS-CoV-2.
Even though it's still questioned, there's no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by humans both deliberately and accidentally.
CoV's back into the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 plague recently.
CoV Studi in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perceptions about the importance of zoonotics and animal reservoirs to HCoV in human transmission.
So much evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and transferred to humans through intermediate.
Considering that SARS-CoV infections are from contact between humans and musangs on the wet market, perhaps the closing of the wet market and the murder of all the musangs in which end the SARS epidemic effectively.
With the same reason, trenggling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, since there's a discovery of some line of my-coV trenggling line close to SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms are transferred to humans through the trenches and other mammals must still be clarified in the research of the future.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for a long time.
This camel works as an important transport tool and as a primary source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local society.
Arab camels spread widely throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all camels to control MERS, as done at the wild animal market in Tiongkok to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop MERS's plague, comprehensive approach must be done to develop vaccine for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, the new genotipe can show up and cause plague.
A number of zoonotic CoV leaves in the wild.
Particularly, CoV bat's potentially zoonotic potential is very different.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and recombinate, which causes new CoV to appear easier to transfer and/or more fatal to humans in the future.
Business eat wild animals in some places in Tiongkok must be left to reduce the unnecessarily human and animal contact.
With the bitter experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, preparations and better intersection plan should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since long ago.
These viruses are in their natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans are to interact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are diabetic to keep away from wild animals.
Surveys continued with mammals need to be done to understand CoV's ecology and its natural instincts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmissions and future plagues.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus zoonosis is that humans have to keep the distance from zoonotic virus reservoir ecological reservoir.
Some partis of the zoonotic puzzle hasn't been found yet.
First, if bat transfers the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the trenches, conditions when bats and trenggling sharing ecological relungs are important to know.
Second, if bats have more direct roles in transmission to humans, the way humans interact with bats must be determined.
Third, if a third mammal plays as an intermediate, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and trenches should be clear.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that might be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experiment infections and surveyings should be done.
Whether bats, trengglings, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or her almost identical virus can be identified in her natural sense in the future.
Advance research in this field will describe the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary routes in animals, with important implications in prevention and COVID-19 control on humans.
The diagnostic diagnostic criteria "cassus" and "confirmed" COVID-19 has to be performed
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick counsel for diagnostics and exposure of new coronavirus infections 2019 (19-nCoV). This guides based on our experience and became a good reference to combat the pandemics around the world.
Even so, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new illness, our consciousness and knowledge are growing according to the ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, the diagnostic and processing strategy are also renovated.
In this letter, we answer one of our comments in our guides and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for the "predictable" and "decfirmed" cases based on diagnostic Guides and Constraints for COVID-19 (7th version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Chinese People's Republic Republic.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (19-nCoV) had caused outbreaks, which are now formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was given the name of heavy acid syndrome syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed quick advice and that guide has been published in the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The guidance has been very interesting since published.
However, it is necessary to be recorded that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing according to the findings of the progressing research and clinical experience; therefore, the strategy of diagnostics and feedment also continues to be updated.
For example, the diagnostic Guide and Constraints for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of Tiongkok (http://ww.nk.gov.cn/), between January 1620 and 3 March 2020, this commission has issued the total seven editions with some contexts have been changed quite.
Our guides received comments from Zhou et al, they introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinic experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guides and became a precious reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Even so, their work results also require updates based on diagnostic Guides and Treatment for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm an unexpected case required a combination of one of the descriptions of epidemiology history with two clinical manifests to make compprehensive analysis, or it requires three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiology history:
Epidemology configuration: (1) a travel history or living in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or another community where COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms; (2) contact history with the infected SARS-CoV2 case (with a positive nucleate acid acid test); (3) contact with patients who have suffered fevers or symptoms from the city Wuhan and around the area, or another area where the COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before a symptoms; (4) the contact of clash contact with cases (confirmed with cases 2/s and symptoms of fevers or symptoms in 2 weeks, in the hospitals, the hospitals, like the hospitals, the school class.).
Clinis Manifestation: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) sensational effects feature COVID-19; (3) total counting white blood cells indicate normal limfosit count, lowering, or lowering at the early stage.
dia diagnostical case must be based on the unexpected case with one of the patogenic or serological evidence in the following: (1) a positive PCR test for the actual times for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire genegenity of the known new coronary; (3) positive to the antibody IgM specific and antibodiG against SARV-CoV2 in a test; or a specific IbodiG-SARV-SCAR2 change from negative, or negative-SCV-SCV2, if the entire genegenegenegene geogene is significantly increased at my level level.
We can see that the actual-time PCR test of nucleat acids in the nucleat channel samples were added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Detect patogenics in blood samples are added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); and then, the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on further research researchers to find optimal nucleus detectional acid detection to quick diagnostics, and samples from the breath channel include the taking of blood, which improves the availability of various specimens, and supports the reproductive resulting of certain antibodis into a confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is an increasing amount of evidence that reminds us of being alert to patients with symptoms of thinness and no symptoms.
That's why Zhou et al. It's got to be renewed because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low-life."
The score system also needs to be verified in precincts and clinical studies in the future.
As a close, we hope the more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to give a comment.
To diagnostic "for the unexpected" and "confirmedkasus," we suggest to follow and follow the latest guides in each country.
Our team will also update our guides periodically as help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the amount of infection cases recorded including 114 active cases and 33 home - healthy cases.
A total of 17 deaths.
In a news interview, director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, says death covers four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases above 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Anti-Fruption Corupsi Bengali, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video announcement, the Secretary of Transportation and Bridges, Obadul Quader said that public transportation would be stopped longer than was planned, until Saturday to come.
This public transport stop has begun since March 26, and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic needs -- medical, fuel, and food -- still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection reported on Bangladesh was on March 8th, on the two people who had just returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three people were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of corona-CoV-2 virus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths associated with COVID-19, disease caused by the corona virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first crown virus infection and Zambia suffered its first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of a few countries that remained free of crown virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1.051.635 cases confirmed, including 79.332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand cases of crown virus, resulting at least 5.900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reported, which quoted Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 1,000 deaths in the United States that were caused by corona virus infections.
Throughout the world, the countries announce a more strict action to halt the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the province to May 1th.
National President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
Portugal's Parliament has been taking a sound to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; it's advocating with 215 voices support, ten votes abstaining, and one vote refused.
Saudi Arab extended the night hours in the holy city of Mekkah and Madinah to the whole day; before, the night's only between three o'clock and six in the morning.
Thailand planned to apply the night hours between 10 and 4 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the order to stay at home until 1 May.
Australia's stores lowered the limits of the purchase of toilets per transaction
On Sundays and Saturday afternoons, the Australia Woolworth and Coles networks each lowered the limits of the purchase of toilets to two and one pack per transaction in all the stores on the national level.
ALDI also applied the bounds of one pack, on Monday.
This restrictions are announced as a message in the backyard and on the Facebook page.
It's reported that the buyers have mounted up supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 that society has to do self-sufficient isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also blocked the purchase of toilet paper for delivery to the house until one pack per mail.
This change follows four packs per transaction that previously applied Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
On the media statement on March 8, Coles reported that by handling the four-pack limitation, "many stores are still running out in an hour since delivery", and mentioning that request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, call it "unforese".
The sale was sharp last week, according to one of the Woolworths talker.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid confinement, Coles ordered a greater order than a supplier and increased delivery frequencies, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while the ALDI made provisions for special Wednesday promotions available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Intelligence Association, said that the intelligence was trying to improve the supplies, but the limits of local government body for the time sending trucks made it difficult.
He anticipates an increase in production cost, as long as the suppliers try to accommodate requests, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that since the provision had been removed earlier, some stores could not hold special Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a riteologist from Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills up supplies every night.
He stresses that toilet papers are large volumes so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold, makes a lot of space empty in the shelfs so the skies become more increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths agree [that] if there's a lot of stuff in the shelf, if the product like a toilet tube and the seizure can [believe] and is in large numbers, the sensation may be minimized, the Russel Zimmerman via the ABC News Office.
The product of the toilet tube resuming that Gives a Crap said on the Wednesday day that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressing they work 24/7 to keep supply, according to News.com.au's report.
Domain.com, a real statt site, reported that some property dealer offered free toilet paper papers to the first barrel in Melbourne, when a little bit of a league is conducted because the buyer took a long break for the weekend of the Buruh.
The Thursday NT News edition, a daily printed in Darwin, includes eight pages of which are intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
The stores are just refusing to apply the limits, according to the report of the Australian ABC on March 3, they say they're not planning to apply the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high requests, including masks, disciplination, dry food, laundry soap, and flour.
As is the case outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the English supermarket of Ocado was observed to limit the buying of Andrew's toilets to two packs containing 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization states the outbreak of COVID-19-- the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -- as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" refers only to how wide a disease has spread, not how dangerous that case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All the countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and emits its subjects as responses, lead Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director of WHO General.
We were very concerned about the influx of preaching and paranoia, as well as the anxiety rate of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center Control and Prevention of Disease, this pandemic has been before.
It says, in the record that CNN was published in February, " besides influenza, no respiratory virus ever traced from its appearance to global spread of continued global.
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen a pandemic taken by coronavirus."
He continues, "and we've never seen a pandemic under control at the same time."
The new pandemic status followed WHO’s decision in January that declared the plague as an extremely disturbing in society.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "of course, this plague will worsen."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, which resulted in more than 4.600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemi 2019-20 is the coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) that is continuing and due to the heavy acid syndrome syndrome syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The death identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019, was described as a World Health Emergency Emerging on January 30, 2020, and was specified as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Until 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases COVID-19 have reported in 210 countries and teritorial areas, which have resulted in about 97.000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people were healed.
Case fatality is estimated 4% in Tiongkok, while all over the world starts from 13,04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The common wave covered fever, coughs, and breaths.
Complications can cover pneumonia and acute breath syndrome.
Time from being exposed to normal symptoms of about five days, but it can start from two to twelve days.
There's no vaccine known or specific antivirus treatment.
The primary treatment of symptomatic and suportive therapy. Precommunicated preventive action includes the washing, shut down the cough, keep the distance from others, and monitoring and self-scanning for people who are expected to be infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by enforceing travel, quarantine, night hours, dangers at work, and facilities closing.
This Pandemi has caused heavy global social disorder, the delay or the relentation of cultural, political, religious, sports, and the scope of the supply of panic purchases.
Schools and universitys have been closed both in national and local levels in 193 countries, which affect some 99,4 percent of the students worldwide.
The misinformation of this virus has spread out and there is an incident of xenofobia and discrimination against the Chinese people, people with their progeny and Asian and Southeast, and people from the area with significant virus cases.
As a result of the declining of travel and heavy industry close, air pollution and carbon emissions decline.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the mayor of Hubei propination, reported pneumonia case clasters with unrecognised cause on December 31, 2019 and research was done early in January 2020.
Those cases are mostly associated with the Huanan Sea Grosir Food market and therefore the virus is expected to have the origin of zoonotics.
The virus that caused the plague was called SARS-CoV-2, a new virus found and engraved with the coronavirrus of the bat, the coronavirus of the twigling, and the SARS-CoV.
Among the first case claster reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found connected with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggests that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old province of Hubei, is probably the first.
There may be a large number of cases that are not reported, especially among people with minor symptoms.
Until 26 February, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19 - year - olds under form 2,4% cases worldwide.
The case refers to the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positively according to official protocols.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with light symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, to January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these un documented infections were the source of infections for 79% of documented cases.
A statistic analysis published on March 30, estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated greater than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center of Control and Prevention of Disease concluded that the number may be 5,7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers recover.
For those who are unresponsive, from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common of 14 days.
Since April 10 of 2020, about 97.000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occur to those above 60 years and 75% have a previous health disorder, which covers cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual fatality of COVID-19 may be much higher, since the official number may not include the person who died without testing, for example, at home, in the care house, etc.
The Italian parsial data found that the sum of death during the pandemic over official death counts with factors 4-5 times as much.
A woman talker to the U.S. Center of Control and Prevention of Disease (CDC) admitted, "We know [all reported death] is less than the actual number", a statement that was strengthened by an unmiciable report of the counting too low in the United States.
The first death outside Tiongkok land occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
Until 28 February, outside the land of China, more than dozens of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13 more than forty countries and the territorial regions have reported deaths, on every continent, except for Antarctica, in general, some measurements are used to count deaths.
This is a number of people, and the number of the tests, the quality of the medical treatment, the period from the first outbreak, and the character of populations such as age, sex, and health, and the death of the case is in proportion to the number of deaths diagnostics in a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death ratio of cases is 6,0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In Tiongkok, the ratio of death rates of the case decreases from 17,3% (for people with a drop of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms of 1 February 2020). Another measurement includes the fatality rate of case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed death of a particular disease, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnognosis and nongnosis) died of certain diseases.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have been trying to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the total number of fatality infections for pandemics between 0,1% and 0,39%.
The limit of this estimate is in line with the result of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical scheduling that analyzes the test effect on the CFR estimate.
WHO asserts that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peaks and the end of the plague are indistinct and may differ according to the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states: "In no way under control, contagious outbreaks are usually multiplying and then they begin to drop when the disease is out of line.
Yet, it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection now about when it happens."
The senior medical adviser of the government Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan says that "the plague may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on the steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On the 17th March, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 would go on, possibly until one or two years.
According to the Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical and other steps will require "the free vaccines available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University states, "I feel a small possibility that this coronavirus, since it's very easy to transfer, can disappear" and this disease "may be turned into a season disease, which comes back every year."
Virulities of retrieval will depend on group immunity and mutation levels.
COVID-19 waves can be relatively unspecific and the infected people can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, breathing sputum production (flegma), loss of kissing, panication, panic, joint pain and muscle pain, headaches, headaches, headaches, whistling, hemoptisis, diarrhea, or sianosis.
The U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes emergency symptoms involving breathing, stress or chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty of walking, and blueness on the face and lips; medical attention immediately suggested if these symptoms appear. More diseases can be severe pneumona, acid syndrome, synapse, sympsis, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asimtomatically, without a clinical symptoms, but with the results that test confirmed infections, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close contact with those who are confirmed must be monitored tight and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimates an asimmatic ratio from a few to 44%.
The period of inkubation (time between infection and symptoms) is usually shifting between 1 to 14 days, at least 5 days.
Details about how this disease spread are still studied.
The COVID-19 service is believed to be particularly happening at the time of close contact and through the tiny droplets produced when cough, coughing, or talking; the close contact is in distance from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets to move up to 4,5 feet (15 feet) to 82 feet (27 ft).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be infected by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced in speaking.
The droplet can fall in the mouth or nose of the person who is near or may be blown into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and rebirth of the lung heart (RJP), can make the respiratory sensation turn into aerosol and spread through the air.
Serving is also possible when a person reaches an contaminated surface, including skin, and then reaches the eye, the nose, and the mouth.
Although there is anxiety that virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed to be low.
The government of Tiongkok overturns the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transminition fekal-oral.Virus is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at further stages of disease.
People gave positive tests to three days before symptoms, signaling transmissions may occur before there are significant symptoms.
Just a few reports of asimtomatic cases confirmed by laboratorium, but asimtomularularularularularity have been identified by some countries during contact investigation.
Europe’s Prevention and Disease Control CEC (ECDC) asserts that although it is not fully obvious how easy this disease is to spread, one person usually infects two to three others.
Specially, it has been found that viruses can be detected for three days on plastic (polipropilen) and steel holding karat 304, one day on the cargo, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varieties depend on humidity and temperature, and other pets and other animals have been tested positively COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can contaminate viruss to humans, even though the British authorities suggest to wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that might have been touched by people infected.
Coronavirus syndrome acute 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first being disolved of three pneumonia sufferers associated with acute respiratory claster cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in nature, outside of human body, this virus can be crushed by the soap of the household, which subverted his protective envelope.
The virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the genetic coronavirus is synonymous with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the Sarbecvirrus subgene (create B) along with two bats.
This virus has 96% similarity at the entire genome level with another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researcher Tionghoa found that there was only a difference between one amino acid in certain parts of the genome viruses between the tenggling and the human virus.
Until now, the comparison of the whole genome found the most of 92% genetic material similarity between the tenggling crownvirus and the SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the tenggiling intermediate is the SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by a virus can be diagnosized while based on symptoms, but confirmation is done in the end by the reaction of back polymerase transcryption chain (rRT-PCR) on infected secrete or disable CT.
A study that compares the PCR with the CT in Wuhan indicates that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, but less specific, with the many features oftrating that are mixed with pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for filtering or as the first lini test in diagnosizing COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA test protocol for SARS-CoV-2, which was first distributed on January 17,
Testing using a polymerase chain reaction transcryption real-time (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on breathing samples or blood.
The results are usually available in a few hours and up to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasofaring usap, but the throat can also be used.
For April 6, 2020, none of this psychic test proved pretty accurate to agree extensive use.
In the United States, the serological test of the Cellex has been approved for emergency usage, only by certified laboratory.
Characteristics of radiation visualization and tomography are linked (CT) to the person who simtometically includes the hybrid glass perimetic and no pleura efutions.
Italian Radiological Society is building international data bases for the discovery of drawings in a confirmed case.
Because the ladder is injected with other infections such as inovirus, injection without confirmation of the PCR has limited specibility in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tiongkok compares the CT's breast results with the PCR and shows that even though less specific for infections, it's faster and more sensitive that it is recommended to be considered a filtering tool in the epidemic area.
Convolusi neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus intracting features with radiatography and CT.
The strategy to prevent the infection of the disease includes keeping good personal cleanliness completely, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouths before washing your hands, and wearing the rhythm of the rhythm or sneezing and immediately dumping the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to use a surgeon mask in public.
The government in various regions has restricted or urged to stop every journey to and from the country and the region that has been affected by the plague.
Yet, the virus has reached the scope of society’s scales in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of the community have no idea where or how they are infected.
The use of the location data from a cell phone by the government for this purpose has triggered the privacy problem, with the release of Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling the limitation of such surveys.
Multiple cellular applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 720, more than dozens of scholars perform friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the approach of the user to another cell phone.
In turn, the users will receive a message if they are close to a positive test for COVID-19.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, even though many organizations are working to develop it.
Stealing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after rubbishing their nose, coughs, or grenades.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by the soap that damages its protective layers.
In addition, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hands with the content of alcohol at least 60% based on volumes when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people not touch their eyes, noses, or mouths before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be contaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute of exposures exposed to karat sustained steel surfaces), including etanol 62–7%, isopropanol 50–100%, hipoklorate natrium 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2–7,5%.
Other lines, such as benzalkonium chlorida and chlorhexydin gukonat, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is an unexpected or confirmed COVID case in public facilities, such as office or child sensation, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, electronic equipment, like tablets, screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the sufferers, should be decfacted.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouth and nose with a clot or use a ribbon when coughing or rinsing, and immediately remove the tissue.
The surgeons are recommended for people who may have been infected because using the mask can restrict volumes and droplets of exploding airlines that spread when speaking, insins, and coughs.
WHO has issued instructions about time and mask use.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with poorly clean hands, which is the source of primaryularularularularity."
WHO recommends the use of masks by the healthy only if they risk high risks, like people who care for COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun pushing the use of masks to members of the community.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical facial maskers made of fabrics. This is specifically recommending the use of medical masks used to healthy people, especially when they are close to 1,3 feet (3 feet) or less than others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgeon masks when using public transport or living in a crowded place.
Thailand’s health office encouraged people to make a cloth mask in the house and wash it every day.
The Czech and Slovakia Republic prohibit the society from going out to public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks on their way to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters toserba torba to wear face masks.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, who produced ten million masks a day since mid - March, has forced train passengers and city buss to wear face masks per April.
Panama is obliged to use the facial mask every time out of the house, and recommends the making of a personal facial mask for those who cannot buy face masks.
Facers are also used extensively in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitation (also called physical limitation) is an act of infection control intended to slow down the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quantine; travel limitation; as well as school closings, jobs, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restrictions by staying at home, restricting travels, avoiding public areas, using greetings without contact, and keeping physical distance from others.
Nowadays, many governments are demanding or demanding social restrictions in pestilence.
The maximum number of people gathered by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (if it's unknown to a COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50, and then to 10 people.
On 22th of March 2020, Germany forbids the meetings in public areas that involve more than two people. Lansia and people with a medical condition based on diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune systems that have more serious risks and complications are recommended for the CDC at all possible homes in the areas of the public absumption. In the end of March 2020, WHO and others of health began to change the use of the term "s of social deficientation" to clear that it is to reduce physical contacts to maintain physical contacts, social or remotely.
The use of the term "sociation" suggests that people have to isolate themselves completely socially and not push people to keep in contact with others through alternative ways.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with people who stay with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Isolation of self-destruction is recommended for people who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and people who are expected to be infected.
The health bodies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-sufficient isolation, many governments require or recommend independent quantines for all the populations that live in an adjacent area.
The strictest self-destruction of quantina was issued for people who were including high- risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people recently traveled to the country or region with a wide range of COVID-19 was recommended to perform a self-defense quantine for 14 days since the possibility of the last display.
The strategy in the control of the plague is a subjugation or expression, as well as mitigation.
Containment is done at the early stage of plague and aims to track and isolate people infected and do other steps to control infections and vaccines that are intended to stop the spread of disease throughout the population.
When there is no longer possible to block the spread of disease, further efforts go to the mitigation level: these steps are taken to slow down the spread and reduce their effects on the health and society treatment system.
Combination of the intersection and the migration can be done at the same time.
The expression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction rate to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of anxiety on health services and gives more time for the development of vaccine and medicine.
The nonfarmation to handle the outbreak includes individual prevention action, such as the janitor, the body mask, and the body-based masks; the steps of the society level intended for physical limitation, such as closeing and canceling mass meetings; the community involvement to encourage reception and participation in such intervention; and stepping in the environmental levels, such as the environmental cleansing. The other dramatic action intended to block the outbreaks were committed when the impact of a sudden outbreak of the disease rises, such as a whole town is revolved and a severe journey.
Other countries also apply various steps that are intended to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces local mass and quarantine filters, and provides a warning about the movement of people infected.
Singapore provides financial support for people infected who do self - quantine and wear huge fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of the facial maskers and punishing the regeneration of medical supplies. The simulation of the United States and the United States shows that the mitigation (slowly, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and susception (returning the growth of epidemics) has a great challenge.
The optimal mitigation can reduce the peak of the demand for health treatment to 2/3 and half of death, but it still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a chronic health system.
The expression can be selected, but it needs to be kept while the virus is still circulated in the human population (or to the vaccine available, if this is the first to reach), because if it isn't, theularity will be reinstalled quickly when the expressions fall.
Long - term Intervations to press pandemics have the effect on social and economics.
No specific antivirus drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being done, which includes an existing drug test.
Summarize free - sold flu drugs, drink enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depends on the level of insecurity, oxygen therapy, intravena fluids, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can make the patient's condition worse.
Some of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viruses are being investigated to be used in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "dramatic and homes" can lessen the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing the capacity and adapting health services for the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to outbreaks.
ECDC and the regional WHO office have provided guidance for hospitals and primary health services to move resources in various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate andsolate positive COVID-19, and increase intensive care skills by training personnel and increase the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case.
The first known coronavirus case could be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases of Hubei gradually increased.
These cases are mostly associated with the Grosir Food Sea of Huanan, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types; or, by other words, the virus has the origin of zootics.
On December 30th, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the others, Ai Fen, were counseled by his superiors for the warnings he had issued.
Wuhan City Health Commission then issued public announcements to the audience on December 31, and told WHO.
Not known enough pneumonia cases are reported to health authorities in Wuhan who then triggered research at the beginning of January, at the early stage of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
Early and early in the middle of January 2020, the virus spreads to other provinces of Tiongkok, supported by migration during the Imlek New Year and because Wuhan is a center of transport and the main train transit.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The further official data indicates that 6,174 people have had symptoms on January 20, 26th March, the United States has exceeded Tiongkok and Italy with the number of the highest-confirmed cases in the world.
About 200 countries and the directorial area have at least one case.
Because of pandemics in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Territory restrict free movement and make border control.
National responses include steppings, such as quarantine (i.e. as a command to stay in the home, a refuge order, or a region), and at 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some kind of areas in the United States, over 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million are expanded to the area of South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people around the world were in some kind of area quarantine conditions, which increased to 2,6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The case COVID-19 confirmed can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; a report that has not been confirmed indicates the earliest case of November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed pneumonia's pneumonia claster with an unknown cause on December 26; this observation told the CDC Jianghan hospital on 27 December.
Genetic test of early patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicates a coronary similar to SARS.
Advertising to the public was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was told on the same day.

In January and February 2020, during the peak of an epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million migrant workers in the countryside of Tiongkok were home in the outback or were trapped in the Hubei province in March 2020, and over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and filed government assistance.
According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, coronavirus outbreaks can cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates can reach 32%.
During the second part of March, 4 million French employees filed a temporary unemployment fund and 1 million British employees filed a universal credit scheme, nearly half a million of the companies in Germany filed a short-term job policy for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
German short-term work schemes were adopted by France and England.
Throughout the world, the art directors of show and cultural heritage are very large by pandemics, which affect organization and individuals, both employed and independent.
The art and culture sectors are trying to uphold their mission (also commonly ordered) to give society cultural heritage access, to the safety of employees and society, and to support artists when possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, places of shows, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with displays, events, and shows canceled or postponed.
In response, an intensive effort was made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, other damaging and rapidly developed diseases are the cancellation of religious services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music and concerts, technologies, and fashion conferences.
The film industry has also been disrupted, and the Vatican announced that the holy Coast celebration in Rome, which fell during the last week of Prapkah’s Christian repentance, was canceled.
Many older Christians are encouraged to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, live broadcasts, or television, while others offer their religious drives or patterns.
With the closed church and chapel by the Roman Catholic Bishop and the banishment of the Holy Peter of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled and restricted public meetings in church, masjids, synagogues, temples, and gurdwara.
The pilgrimage of Iran (Mary) hastened the prayer (of Allah) in a place of plague and was closed, and the Arab Saudi prohibited the pilgrimage and its people to the sacred places of Mekah and Mahahah (the Holy Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him).
This Pandemi has been a major interference with the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or delayed, including the Champions of the UEFA 2019-2020, the Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA 2020 years, and NHL 2019-2020.
This plague messed up the 2020th summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled, will begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Comite announces on 24 March that the event will be "attapped up to 2020, but it will not be more than the summer 2021." All over the world, the casino and the rest of the game is closed and the direct tournament poker is delayed or canceled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling reports a significant increase in registering.
Many big theaters like Broadway also delay all the show.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing works over the Internet as alternatives to traditionally direct public displays, such as the live live broadcast concert or make the "festival" web-based for artists to display, spread and publish their works.
A lot of Internets with coronaviruss are spread out by a lot of people who turn to humor and distraction in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenofobia, and racism against the descendants of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people of the abandoned regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Inside fear, suspicion, and widespread hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pasific areas.
Reports from February (when most cases are still limited in Tiongkok) note the racist sentiments expressed in various groups worldwide that the Tionghoa deserve to receive the virus or accept what they claim to be a due reward.
Some countries in Africa also have increased anti-Tiongkok sentences.
Many of the people of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of the origin of their area.
There's been support for the Chinese, both ding and lured, and for the people in the viruses.
The development of the plague to new states of hotspots, the Italians, the first European countries who suffered the serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicions and xenofobia.
In Japan, tares #ChineseDontComeToJapan became the trench of Twitter.
Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported increasing racist harassment and assault.
President US Donald Trump is criticized for calling a crownvirus as "Tongkok Virus", a term by critics considered racist and anti-Tiongkok.
The smugglers in Ukraine attacked buses that brought Ukrainians and strangers evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East Sea India, with Tiongkok, and studying in large Indian cities reported to have been harassed with coronavirus outbreaks.
President Bharatiya Janata's state unit in West Benggala Dilip Ghosh said that Tiongkok had destroyed the universe and that's why God took vengeance on them.
That statement was later convicted by the Tiongkok consult in Kolkata, by calling it "couldle". In Tiongkok, xenofobia, and racism against non-Tonghoa is boiling because of pandememic, with strangers described as "a foreignmp" and shot to "remove".
Many newspapers using pay payments have wiped them out for some or all of their crowns.
Many scientific publishings have made scientific physics related to outbreaks available with open access.
Some scientists choose to quickly share the results in precept servers, such as bioRxiv.

The test of the laboratory for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the existence of the virus and that detect the antibodi that is produced as the response to infections.
The existence of the virus in a verified sample with RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect the RNA-CoV-2 virus alone.
This test is used to confirm a new infection or still active.
Antibodi detection can be used for population diagnostics and surveying.
Antibodi tests indicate the number of people infected, including those who have symptoms too light to report or who have no symptoms.
The exact mortality of the disease and the rate of immune group in the population can be determined by this test.
Because of limited testing, up to March 2020, no country has a reliable data about virus prevalence in its population.
Until 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its populations, and there's a big variation in the number of tests done by countries.
This variety may also affect significantly the fatality of the reported case, which is likely to be counted too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of the original-time transcryption polimerase chain (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed onpassing samples obtained with various methods, including nasofaring or sputum samples.
Generally, the results are available within hours of two days.
Tests of RT-PCRs done on throats are only trusted on the first week of disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it keeps replicating in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the tested person in the second week, sample materials can be taken from the inner breathing channel by using the filler or material that is released through cough (sputum).
One of the early PCR tests developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 used the reaction of the red-time polymerase transcryption chain, and forming at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Britain also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean business Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-CoV-2-based SCR detection (PowerChek Coronavirus) cliss on January 28, 2020.
This device searches the "E" genes that all coronavirus beta, and the RdRp genes specific for SARS-CoV-2. In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first firms to accept the emergency use of the Tiongkok National Medical Medical Administratives for the SARS-CoV2 detectation tool. In the United States, the Center of Control and Preventure (DCC) distribute Panel DiagnoscTRT-CRCRCRSSSSSS-Revirus Baru-19 (19-19-C) to the Rent public worker.
One of the three genetic tests in the old versions provided an insensitive result of reagen error, and the amount of testing at CDC in Atlanta is limited; this leads to approximately less than 100 samples a day processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components is considered unreliable to February 28, 2020, and then the state and local laboratory were allowed to test.
This test is approved by the U.S. Obat and Food Programme, based on the U.S. Aleksamen's Authority.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR on national scale.
Likewise, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 tests available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There is no conceivable quantity limit; gathering and processing specimens must be done according to the CDC conditions.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests are developed and produced by the Virology and Bioteknology VECTOR State Research Center.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Services for Surveys in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, the Roche diagnostics received the FDA agreement for tests that could be done in 3,5 hours with a high volume so one machine can do about 4,12 test in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation of emergency usage (EA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EU from FDA for tests that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using amplification of Islamic acid nucleats that are not PCR.
Because it does not require a series of temperature cycles, this method can bring positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18.000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbotts expecting to increase the production to produce 50,000 tests a day.
A review of the library published in March 2020 concluded that "the obsessed photograph has a small diagnostic value at the early stage, the beginning of the CT [computationography] discovery may already exist before the symptomswide.
Special feature on the CT includes ground-glass multilobar in particular with perifer distribution, asimetri, and posterior.
Subpleuse domination, crazy paving, and consolery are formed as a result of disease.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with the CT at the point of the current pandemic indicates that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with a lot of tune-in-insurance features with pneumonia and other diseases processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for filtering or as the first lini test in diagnosizing COVID-19." On March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is an antibodi formation that includes IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect individual infections since about 7 days after symptoms, to determine the immunity of disease, and in population surveys. Checking can be done in central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care test (PoCT).
The automated system with high results in many clinical labs will be able to do this check, but its willingness depends on the production level for each system.
For CLT, one specimen of perifer blood is commonly used, though a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For the PoCT, it's usually used a specimen of perifer blood that is obtained through a skin fist.
Unlike the PCR method, an extraction step is not required before checking. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notices to the agency as necessary and that can now distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7 of 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on authorisation of emergency usage. At the end of March 2020, the Medical Laboratory Euroimmun Medical Laboratory and Epitope was diagnosed for European approval for their test device that could detect the antibodi IgG and IgA in the blood sample.
The testing capacity to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR checks against virus RNA.
The antibody was usually detected 14 days after the infectionwide, and in early April, Britain found that none of the antibodi test tools he bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong set up a scheme that patients can suddenly live in the house, "in the emergency department will give the synthese tubes to the patients," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results later. The NHS of England announces that NHS is pioneering the expected case test schemes in the house so that they lose the risk of other infected patients if they come to the hospital or need to reaffect an ambulance if used. On the test set up for the expected case of COVID19, a professional health force will take the necessary sample.
The posture center has helped South Korea to test at the fastest and widest than any country, on 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said that Germany has a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the road raw order and 10.700 tests had been done in the previous week.
The costs are paid by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19th, audition test was offered in some big cities.
On March 26, 2020, the amount of tests performed in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first lab survey revealed that, totally, at least 483. 295 samples have been tested to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) positive test for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers in Technion Hospital and Rambam hospitals develop and test the method of testing samples of 64 patients equally, using more testing if the samples are found positively. Wuh, emergency laborators detectorators are as a total of 2,000 square meters named "Huo-G" (Julan language:Mata) in the Indonesian language opened by more than 520 BI, a day.
With the construction of BGI Wang Jian's founder and it takes five days, modifications indicate that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost associated with karantina management can be twice as much as possible if this testing capacity is not available.
The Laboratorium Wuhan immediately followed by the Huo-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, at the total of 12 cities throughout the Tiongkok.
For 4th March 2020, the total capacity of the daily capacity of 50,000 tests a day. The multiplication of the open source is published by Origmi Assays can test as many as 1.222 patients for COVID-19 by just using 93 checks. This balanced design can be carried out in small laboratory without needing robotic fluids.
Until March, insufficient regenency and inadequacy have been a bulwark for mass testing in the United States, Europe, Britain, and the United States.
Because of that, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample exposure protocols that involve sample warming at 98 °C (2018 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further tests. On 31 March, the Arab Emirat Union reported that there was a greater test of the population's coronaries than any country, and ready to increase the testing scale for most of the population.
This is achieved by the combination of recursive testing and the purchase of the mass laboratory of the population periodically from the Grup 42 and BGI (based on the laboratory detecting "Huo-Yan" emergency in Tiongkok).
Builded in 14 days, this lab is capable of performing dozens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first lab that has this scale outside of Tiongkok.
Various tests of various parts of the genetic profiles developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts the German prescription for the production of test tools sent to low - income countries without resources to develop themselves.
The German Resep was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Center was not available until 28 January to slow down the test available in the United States.
On the other hand, experts say that a vast test available in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called the increase in testing program as the best way to slow down the growth of COVID-19 pandemic pandemics, a high request for testing for widespread viral spreads caused hundreds of thousands of tests waiting for the service in private American laboratory, and the supplies of gas and chemical reagenes to be critical.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported an acquisition problem on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tool that the CDC developed has "cat," the government then removes the bureaucracy barrier that prevents testing by privates.
The company explained that the wrong results were possible because of failure in collecting samples or using the test tools correctly.
The Spanish Ministry says that they're going to pull the device that produces incorrect results, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools that the Czech Republic of Tiongkok bought have produced incorrect results.
The Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this test tool be removed to the Danube River.
Testing, followed by positive tests and tracking people with positive SARS-CoV-2 results.
Investigators working in the city of Vò Italy, the first location of death by COVID-19 in Italy, do two tests on the entire population of 3.400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people who have a positive test have no symptoms, and all the cases found in quarantine.
With the limitation of travel to this community, new infections are eliminated at all.
With aggressive contact tracking, incoming limitation, testing, and karantine pandemic, 2020 coronavirus pandemics in Singapore have developed much slower than other developed countries even without extreme limit, such as collision of restaurants and rite companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore suggested that the people stay at home on March 28th, but the schools were opened back on time after the vacation on March 23,.
Some other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, incoming limitation, testing, and quarantine, but with unresponsive territory karantine, such as Islandia and South Korea.
A statistics study found that the countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a far lower fatality rate, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries who do not have the capacity of testing, and national laboratory with the limited COVID-19 experience, sending five positive samples COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO's testing labs for confirmation.
Of 16 lab references, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "%s" is influenced by the state test policy.
The country that only tests those who are treated in the hospital will have % positive results higher than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors the same.
Washing hands, also called a sanitation, is an act of cleaning someone's hands that aims to remove shit, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Stealing hands with constant soap at certain "critical" all day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diare and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or clumsy, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths (that is, mukosa membrane).
Five critical moments all day to wash hands with soap is: before and after taking a big water, after cleaning a child's ass or repaid, before raising a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or baking meat, fish, or raw eggs.
If there is no water and soap, hands can be cleaned with ashes, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning the kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning our noses, coughs, or vapors.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical cleanance refers to a precinct associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medicine or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean the hands of patogens (also, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important to those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also a precinct that matters to the public.
Scattering hands have many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, crown virus, and other contagious diseases; preventing the cause of contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality of the baby in the delivery at home.
The program that was done in 2013 showed that the more practice of washing hands can increase the growth of the young child’s height.
In developing countries, the mortality of children due to respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of the disease to nearly 50%.
Intervenments that encourage handwashing can reduce the case of diarrhea to about a third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - income areas.
48% of diarroneous cases can be associated with a handwashing with soaps and soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infections of the diarrhea channel (ISPA), as the underconscious behavior done in the home, school, and the public around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one child's death; this disease causes death of about 1,8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia kills nearly 3,5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making a handful of soap before eating and using the toilet to be a maze can save more lives than any vaccine or medical action, and reducing deaths of diarrhea to almost half and death by acute respiratory infection.
Stealing is usually merged together with other sanitation acts as part of water, sanitation, and cleanliness.
Stealing also protects itself from the impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of washing hands is a regular washing of hands can cause skin damage to the skin.
The study done in 2012 in Denmark found that overcrowded hands could cause the skin and sided conditions, known as the eximilation of hands or dermatis, which were particularly common among health officials.
Driving hands too often is seen as one of the obsessive-compressive disorders (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is essential for reducing a fecal-oral disease infection, which is: before and after using the toilet (moving small water), after cleaning the child's ass, before raising a child, before eating and before/see preparing food or baking meat, fish, or raw unggas.
Other important times when it comes to applying proper washing techniques to prevent the infection of disease is before and after treating wounds; after sneez, coughing, or blowing their noses; after touching animal shit or handling them; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study about the washing of hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that average 38,7% of the households had a handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudiian Arabs had a high level of 97 percent; the United States was nearly middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now there are some changes to make the behavior of the dissimulation with soappoints at times critically critically.
The U.S. Medical Health Program, applied by the Educational Department in the Philippines, is an example of timely action to support child’s health and education.
The giving of worm drugs twice a year, plus by washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program also works successfully in Indonesia.
The microorganism of the skin is strengthened by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to the solution and increase the power.
The water is just unefficient skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is a organic dirt component, it is not easy to get into water.
Nevertheless, adequate water flows help cleaning and proteins.
Saabun is solid, since its qualities can be reused, it may contain the bacteria obtained from the previous usage.
A small number of studies that study bacteria transfers from solid soap are contaminated have concluded that transfers cannot happen because the bacteria are mixed with busa.
Even so, the CDC continues to declare "a water cair that it releases from a container without touch more than a hand. "
The antibakery is greatly encouraged to a society that is conscious of health.
Until now, there has not been any evidence that antiseptic use or synchronized syndrome is better for antibiotic organisms in the world.
However, antibaktery soaps contain general antibakery agents such as tricks, which have a list of hugely resistant organisms.
So even though antibiotic strains are not targeted by antibakery soaps, these soaps may not be the target of the filtered.
In addition to the skin-protectives and acid substances, the advanced formulation can contain acids (as asettate, acid acid acid, acid acid acid, acid acid acid) as a pH, az, asymic acid acid acid as an acid, and a skin conditioner (scumblosured, vitamins, bulbs, and plants extract). A comprehensives from the Masoctacy of the University of Oregons indicate that soaptatrics are as effective as an antibakter of conssumeric acids that the cons are in trixicrobacroba disease and prevents the bacteria.
A warm water that is comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bakteri grows faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than cold water flows in eliminating natural oils that hold noodles and bacteria.
In contrast, however, scientific studies show that warm water use has no effect in reducing microba sum in hand.
Hands or hands antiseptics are a hygiene agent that doesn't operate on water.
In the late 1990s and early the 21st century, the hands sanitation agents of a waterless booze (as well as an alcohol-based wristling, a antiseptic hand, or a hand-trapping) came to be known.
Most of these hygiene agents are insulating alcohol or etanols that are manipulated together with the oiling material like Carbomer (catter acrilat acrlat acms) become a gel or along with humidities like glecrin into liquid or buses to be used easily and to reduce the effects of excluded from alcohol.
Adding hydrogen oxide encer enthusiasts further antimicroba activity, hand management that contains at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient bug killer.
Multiple liquors kill bacteria, sustained bacteria against many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (acquired HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vacinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and jamur.
Alcohol abuse that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3,5, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after the use and 99,99% to 99,999% (log reduce to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minutes after use.
The alcohol-based hands are almost completely uneffected against the virus of norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause for contagious gastrorets.
The front and back of two hands and in the frames and the tips of all the fingers were rubbed about 30 seconds to fluids, buses, or dry gels.
The fingers must also be washed well by rubbing them in two hands, the U.S. Centers of Control and Prevention of Disease suggesting the curvature instead of the glittering hand, especially when the hands seem dirty.
The increase in the use of hybrid agents for quick use and murder activity against microorganisms; yet, the displacement agents should not be used as the right laundry, except the soap and the water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hands can often cause a dry skin, unless the emoliens and/or the skin pellings are added to formulas.
The effect of emptiing from alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding gleiserin and/or other emoliens to formulas.
In the clinical test, alcohol - based hands containing emoliens cause iritation and skin crusts are much lower than soaps and antimicroba detergents.
Alcohol contact systematic, contact uretic syndrome, or hypersensitivity against alcohol or aditif substances in alcohol waste of hand are rarely seen.
Lowering trends cause disturbing contact dermatis to be the attraction of this product than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents are not cleaning hands from organic materials, but only deciphering them.
For this reason, the cleaner of the hands has not seen the soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still in hand.
Alcohol - free hand generosity is largely dependent on its material and formulations, and, according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol waste.
Recently, the formulation that uses the benzalkonium klorida has proved to have ongoing and cumulative antimicroba activity after the use, unlike alcohol, which its generosity has been reduced after repeated use, perhaps because of the progressive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities could not afford to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Abu or land may be more effective than water, but it is less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is that if it is contaminated with microorganism, soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ashes is also a deinfectan agent because, if contact with water, ashes will form a alkalin solution.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The technique to wash the right hands based on a U.S. Center recommendation for prevention of diseaseularity includes the following steps:
Blow your hands with warm or cold water flowing.
Water flows are recommended because the silent bascoom may be contaminated, while water temperatures seem to be indiscriminate.
Buy her hands with a lot of soap, including the back of her hands, in a few fingers, and under my nails.
Saabun lifts a pillow from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash more closely when using soap than when using water alone.
Snap for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbishing in creating a grenade, which helps remove the gloves from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
When carefully underwater flows.
Putting in the baskom can make the hands polluted back.
Settle it with a dry lap or let it dry in the air.
The wet and lembab hands are easier to polluted back, the area that is often passed by is a thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the nails.
My nails and nail paint can save microorganisms.
The volatile losion is often recommended to keep the hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection infection.
Some of them may be made to facilitate the hands of the water and/or the soap is not available, for example, flowing water from a canvas or bottle hung and (or using ash), if necessary, in the developing country, in a limited state of water (like a country or a rural area in a developing), there is a solution of water heaviation, such as "tippy-tap", and other low-enable options.
The Keran tippy is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water hung with ropes, towels operated by feet to pour some water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective handbending is an important part of the hands - sanitation process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of stitching hands in the public toilets.
More and more studies show that paper laps are much cleaner than the electrical dryer found in many toilets.
In 2008 a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by the European Symposium’s lap paper industry, to compare the sanitation level of paper lapses, warm air sweaters, and more modern jet airring.
After washing and seizing hands with warm airrings, the total number of bacteria found increased by 194% in fingerbooks and 254% in handheld.
Smoking with jet air filters causes the total number of bacteria to increase at least 42% in fingerbooks and 15% in the handheld.
After washing and drying hands with paper lapse, the total amount of bacteria reduces 76% in fingerbooks and 77% in handhelds. The scientists also test to determine the potential of cross contamination on other toilet users and the toilet environment because of each type of drying methods.
The airflower of jet, which drives the air from the units at the speed claimed 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could blow microorganism from the hands and units and potentially polluting other toilet users and toilet environments to 2 feet [2 m].
The use of warm air - conditioning filters spreads microorganism to 0.25 meters of dryers.
The paper lapses did not show a significant microorganism spread in 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of degrading hands were evaluated.
After a handwriting, the change of the number of bacteria is observed:
There's a lot of filtering maneuvers, and the sweater has been compared to filtering by using paper laps.
Washing hands by using a hand-containing tissue is an alternative for the travel if there's no soap and water.
Alcohol - based hands must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical arrest was mandatory long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing hospital illness.
There's an electronic device that provides back bait to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rate decreases with the use of the device.
Medical washing was done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in many or gels to rub and rub each side of the hand.
Hands must be rubbed together with fingers hanging.
If there's shit under my nails, the fur scar can be used to remove it.
Because germs can survive the water in the hands, their hands need to be tap and dry with clean laps.
After dry, paper laps are used to turn off the water crane (and open the exit if necessary).
These actions avoid recontamination of hands from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to eliminate microorganism of "might" and to avoid itsularity.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of the washing of hands is still on an unacceptable level in most of the medical environment, with a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching patients to contaminate microorganism.
One study shows that proper hands wash and other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood flow related to kateter to 66 percent.
WHO’s hygiene concept can also be seen on his website for public comments.
The relevant review was performed by Whitby et al.
The komersil device can measure and revulge the hands of cleanliness if the obedience to the rules is required.
World Health Organization has "Lima Time" to wash hands:
when the body's blood is embedded
Before the accepted duty, and
After patient treatment. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soaps or "antimicroba" works to kill the laundry material.
The killing function may be wanted before performing a surgeon or in a situation when an antibiotic sustaining organism is very common. For 'goose' hands before surgery, it needs a keranches that can be rotated and off without touch, a clorhexigenin or yodium, a sterile lap to separate the hands after the laundry, and a sterile cyrus to rubbrush and other sterile inst to clean under my nail.
All jewelry should be released.
This procedure signals washing the hands and the lower arm to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
An old waste time (10 minutes) is not required.
When boiling, the water in the under arm must be cut off so that it doesn't flow back into the hands.
After the laundry was done, the hands were sealed with sterile cloths and were charged with a surgical garment.
To reduce the spread of germs, it would be better to wash hands or use a handcut before and after handling the sick.
To control staffic infections in the hospital, it's found that the biggest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the first 20% of washing, and that the extra benefits that are obtained are very little when the obstruction of the hands is increased above 35%.
Washing with the usual soap leads to more than threefold infectious infections to food than washing with antibakterine soaps. The damage between rubbing hands with alcohol-based solutions and washing hands with antibakterest soaps during each median 30 seconds indicates that an alcohol-smokers have reduced bacteriaic contamination 26% more than antibakery soaps.
But the soap and water are more effective than the alcohol-based bulk to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficile from the hands.
More research is required to find out the most effective intervention in various health - care arrangements.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way that costs to reach good health and even good nutrition.
Yet, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand laundry facilities in the home, school, and place of work made targets to achieve universal handswashing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, a curtains near the private or common toilets are rarely available, although the options are available to make cheap handswashing.
In any case, the low level of washing of hands can also happen because of customs that have been planted rather than because of lack of soap or water.
The pressure and encouragement to wash hands with soap can affect policy decisions, enhance awareness of the benefits of a wash, and produce long - term population behavior changes.
To walk effectively, surveillance and evaluation are required.
A systematic survey of 70 studies found that community-based approach is effective in improving the handwashing in LMIC, while the social marketing campaign is less effective. One example of the "Three Approval" by UNICEF that encourages school to take simple and cheap steps to make sure that students wash their hands with soaps, among other conditions.
When minimum standards are achieved, school can move from one star to the end of the three stars.
Building a washing place may be part of a handwashing campaign performed to reduce child disease and death.
The World Handfall Day is another example of the increase campaign of consciousness trying to achieve the purpose of behavior change.
Some studies are researching the effectiveness of the cost to wash the whole hand in developing countries in connection with Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the years lost by the pain.
One survey shows that it encourages the washing of hands with soap significantly costs more than water and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in rent, such as the new mother or the wounded soldiers in the hospital, the first known in the middle of the 19th century by the two hand hygiene hygiene manager Ignaz Semmelweis, who works in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infections were caused by a rotten smell called myasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the outbreaks that were transmitted through foods and infections associated with health care made the U.S. Centers of Control and Prevention active in pushing hands as a vital way to prevent infection spread.
The pig flu bowl in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic pandemic in 2020 increased consciousness in many countries would be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from the contagious disease.
For example, poster "echnic washing the right hand" was hanged next to the betaffel washing hands in the public toilet and at the toilet of the office and the airport in Germany.
The expression "stolening hands of" means saying a person's willingness to be responsible for something or to get involved in something.
That expression comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed hands on the decision to bring about Jesus Christ, but it has been an expression widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is starting to wash his hands constantly to clear the imaginary noda; which shows his guilt for the crime he did and because he has persuaded his husband to do so.
It has also been noted that, as a result of remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate more the use of washing hands.
In addition, the person who was allowed to wash his hands after the meditation had a smaller cocommunication involved in the "removing" action, like volunteering.
And Allah is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and the earth, and the earth and the earth shall be made to pass away from it.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims are obliged to wash their hands after using toilets.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims are obliged to wash their hands before and after meals.
COVID-19 is dangerous to work.
The danger of work management for COVID-19 is the application of security metodology and working health for dangerous control using coronaviral prevention 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper danger at work depends on work and work jobs, which is based on the risks of display sources, the severity rate in society, and the risk factor of each employee who might be infected by COVID-19.
According to U.S. Security and Health Administration, low display work has minimal contact with public and other colleagues; for this job, encouraged steps to prevent basic infections, which include washing hands, pushing workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory ethics, and doing cleaning and insinfecting the working environment regularly.
The job is risky about a job that needs close contact or often with an unknown or expected COVID-19, but it may be infected because of exposure in the current society or international travel.
This group includes employees who have contact with public society such as at school, working environments with high population density, and high volume rites.
The danger of this group, besides the prevention of basic infections, includes the ventilation using high efficiency airbees, the protector againstsin, and provide a self-protected device when it meets with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSH considered health energy and body room displayed on the known or expected to have COVID-19 risks of high display, which increased the risk of high displays if employees perform airwork procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or expected to have COVID-19 suffered.
The appropriate danger of this employee involves technical control, such as negative ventilation room, and self - protection tools that fit the job.
COVID-19 wine can have some effects at work.
Workers may not come to work because they are sick, need to care for others, or fear the possibility of display.
Traffic patterns can change, either in the kind of things asked or how to get these items (like shopping out of busy hours, through delivery, or reorganizing).
Finally, the delivery of the geographical region that COVID-19 is very damaged can be disrupted and the plan for deficiency of infection disease can be used to drive a protection action.
Plans consider the risk rate associated with various jobs and jobs, including display sources, risk factors that arise from home and society, and risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also describes the control required to deal with the risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the plague.
Loneliness and a plan for the infectious disease deficiency may be subjected to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of prevention of outbreak includes reducing exposure between staffs, protecting people who risk higher for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimising bad effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of disease in the community where business is affecting the evacuation action taken.
Presumptuous hierarchy is a working frame that is much used in security and work health to commute dangerous controls based on its efficiency.
When the COVID-19 dangers cannot be removed, the most effective operation is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last self-protective tool.
Technical control includessolating employees from the dangers associated with work without depending on employees and can be the most expensive solution to apply.
Administrative operation is a change in the policy or procedure that requires the work action of employees or workers.
A self - protection tool (APD) is considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but it can help prevent some displays.
All types of APD must be selected based on dangers on the employees, properly installed as it does (i.e., respirator), used consistently and true, checked, treated, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleared, and kept correctly or removed to avoid identification.
According to U.S. Security and Work Health Administration, low - view jobs risky contact with the public and other colleagues.
Steps of preventing basic infections that are recommended for all jobs include often washing hands carefully, pushing the workers to stay in the house if it is sick, breathing ethics include covering and waist, providing networks and rubbish containers, preparing work from distances or shifts on time to return, if necessary, tell the employees not to use the tools and equipment and other people, and cleaning the environment routinely.
A quick and isolation to individuals potentially contagious is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acid disease symptoms need to stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever or other symptoms, and that the disease-protective policy may be flexible so that employees may be able to live in the home to care for the sick members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, the risk job of display is involving work that needs close contact or often in the distance of six feet (1,8 meters) with the unknown or expected to have COVID-19, but it may be infected with SARS-CoV2 because of exposure in society around the business location, or because someone just made an international trip to the location with the vast COVID-19 transmission.
These groups include employees who have contact with the public community such as at school, working environments of high populations, and high volume-speed rites. The techniques for this group and high- risky groups include installing high air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing phythilelike physics, and installing patrons of controllers or uploading programs for customers. Administrative jobs for this group, and high-estimating groups include pushing workers to stay in the home, changing contact with virtual communications, making the shifting shifts of time to the arrival of COV-19s, which are developing the emergency communicational environmental environmental skills, such as training and cooperative forces of cooperative employeffic and coaching skills.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respiratory.
If someone gets sick on a plane, the proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from others by 6 feet, pointing one of your cabins to take care of the sick, and offering a face mask to the sick or to ask him to shut the mouth and nose with a hail when the rockk or sink.
You cabins need to wear a medical glove once in case of caring for the sick passengers or touching the body fluids or the surface that is potentially contaminated and perhaps other self-protectives if the passengers are ill with fever, the coughing, or the trouble of breathing.
And if you are on the ship, you will not be able to do it.
The idea is, medical action is done in the isolated people's cabins, beyond public witnessing, for school and child sensation facility, CDC recommends short - term closing to clean or edit if people infected were ever in the school building.
If there isularity in the community at the minimum level of progress, social limitation strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, choir class, or diffairs, increase the distance between the table, time and return, restricting non-sensitive visitors, and using the location of a separate health office for children like flu symptoms.
If there is highularity in the local community, along with social limitation strategy, it is considered to extend the end of the school, for law law enforcement officials who perform daily routine, the immediate risk of health is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who had to have contact with a confirmed or expected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical techniques, including using the appropriate self-protect aid.
If a close contact occurs during the arrest, the employees have to clean up and edit the belt and task equipment before being used back with a flashing or sketching of the home and following the standard operation to control and remove the old APD and to control and wash the dirty clothes.
OTHA considers health and particular morgue energy to be in a high or high - risk category of display.
The risk of high displays include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport energy that are displayed with known or expected COVID-19 patients.
This job is a very high risk of display if employees perform aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, known or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol producting procedure includes intubation, cough parental procedures, broncopy, several procedures and tooth checkings, or invasive specimen emissions.
The work of the bodyroom risks high displays include employees involved in preparing the known or expected COVID-19 cases at death; this job is very high risky if employees are doing autopsy. Additional techniques for this risk group include isolation space for known or expected COVID-19 patients, including when asolation procedure is performed.
Specific negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some health care and morgue settings.
The specimen must be handled with the 3th Biological Security precaution action.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients come separated into different waiting spaces based on the case COVID-19. In addition to the other APD, OSHA recommends breathing for those who work in six feet of known or expected to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and people who perform aerosol manufacturer procedure.
In the United States, NIOSH or better filtering respiratory that is approved should be used in the context of the written and comprehensive breathing program that includes tests of adjustment, training, and medical checkup.
Other types of respiratory can provide greater protection and enhance the worker's comforts. WHO does not recommend the whole closed clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not transmitted through the fluid of the body.
WHO just recommends the surgeon mask for the screening officer at the point in.
For the person who takes a breathing specimen, cares, or transports patients COVID-19 without aerosol product procedure, WHO recommends a surgeon mask, protective glasses, or face shields, covers, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedure is done, the surgeon mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2 respiratory.
In view of that the APD supply is not enough throughout the world, WHO recommends the APD needs by remote medical services, the physical diverts such as the blinding window, with only person who is directly involved in treatment can enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD that is required for a certain task, to continue using the same breath without leaving when caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and monitoring the chain supply APD, and not pushing more people without symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Lower the load and prepare the future
ANGGAL/When EXPERIENCE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENTION: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in an incredible situation this month.
The COVID-19 Epidemic is the thing that makes global human contact and the responsibilities we have with each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all fellow workers through emails, calls, and chats are incredible validation of humans, which we're quite lucky, to work with them.
Gratitude and pride can be called all of you as fellow workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means to the world today to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this vital resources to remain available to everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays running, helps pay our fellow, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs information given to Wikipedia, especially now.
It's a moment when it's not just the work we do, but the way we do it, it'll make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments on how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we consider things that we think are the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization in the past.
We really want to get rid of pressure and support our mission for long-term.
If you need to reduce the schedule of work, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a holiday, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for the loved one, shopping for the basic needs, or going to the doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should not have been said, but we did.
Edge or PTO is not required, enough notify your manager and help your team designate calendars and schedules to ensure the main worksheet can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed with the positive COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T
The friends who pay for hours will be paid in full.
We've said it, and say it again, to respect our commitment to contractor's contractor and the clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal hours of work when it's normal.
It's including if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling stress on the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what should be expected and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operation, Confidence and Security, and funding teams, among other things, do some important work that might require extra support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to evaluate our current destination and move our focus to support the essential things for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus full on the most essential project.
slowing down at this time will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on going after this pandemic job.
You won't be expected to work overtime to meet the immunities of the current time.
We realize that things change and will try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about APP?
To adjust to new realitys and spectation of daily work hours, we meant to adjust the timeline for the execution of the 2020-2021 Year Plan.
We mean to propose a 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so employees can give priority to important jobs, self-treatation, and loving care as they accommodate those who need or want to work on less time for the next few weeks.
The length of the timeline is very slowing down the load of work and today's planning pressure all over the organization.
We'll deliver our proposal to the council next week and will update the delegates and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, view, and office cleanup
Last week, we were told that one of our fellows based on SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of concern, we hired an antivirus cleaner crew to inject all the surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They're using the antivirus fluid cruising the hospital to discipline every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building implements its own security protocol using products that support the renter's safety.
We were happy that the office would be ready when we decided to return.
Our DC office is in WeWork, which has passed the COVID-19 protocols to us and all the staff on the DC.
From last week, our DC office has moved to a long-lost work order, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As noted by some of our fellows in NYC, we were also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This disconnect continues, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a distance for the first time.
Our long - working associates realize that it may need adjustments and they want to advise you:
The duration limit is at last one or two hours.
If a longer session is required, consider how to divide it into a couple of days.
Define closeness, agenda, and send previous publications.
Make videos a default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connections.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor chattering for questions and recordings, and someone to help make a meeting notes (or make collaborative records).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your peace compensation to buy small foods.
Join with the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to the fellow about the work shared
The SDM Operation team is searching for a webinar-based ergonomi guide to support increased work distributions throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community funders to undo Wikimedia's public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO stated the pandemic was over.
We told them that we understood our request for reversals and other restrictions could make them impossible to complete the approved course activity and that no one would be given a penalty because it had to delay or modify the target.
This next week we'll continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and regional community conferences and other themes.
Generally, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be the grief of this disorder, but as well as relief for the clarity and the ability to focus on their own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Go ahead, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide room for the community to monitor the effects and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 1400 UTC/07:00 for special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect together.
We're together in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to keep a regular communication with the staff who lives in countries that are now marked by significantly.
If you have a question about travel, events, the main work course, or the difficulty of liputants, or something else that may need help, do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We're here to help support and become contacters as necessary.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, director of the International Global SDM Operation.
No one of these changes is seen as our work and obligations.
Rather, these changes are a confession that, now, our jobs and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so we can keep working, provide the support needed for our movement, and give the world the service they depend on.
The work we planned earlier will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months ahead.
We need all of you to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work the best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Enzim angiotension 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that sticks to the outer surface of the cell in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and usus.
ACE2 has activity contrary to angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising target of drug treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a point in the cell for some crownvirus.
ACE2 human versions are often called hACE2.
Angiotensic 2 diversion enzyme is metaloenzim containing slings located on the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has a M2 piptidase terminal-N domain and the amino ral collectrin terminal-C transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single wing protein type I type, with the active domain of the enzymes displayed on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
Extrax domain ACE2 separated from the transparency domain of other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the resulting proteins were released into the bloodstream and was finally ejected into the urin.
ACE2 is in most of the organs: ACE2 sticks on cell membranes mainly lung cells of type II, small usus enterocts, arterial endotel cells and ventilation cells, and arterial muscle cells in most of the organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypotalamus, and brain bars.
ACE2's main function is a ACE balancer.
ACE broke angiotensian hormone I became angiotensin II vasokonstract.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino fenilalanin terminal carboks from angiotensi II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and controls it into angiotensil operator (H-Asp-Artal-Tyr-Ile-His-OH).
ACE2 can also break a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradinin, apples, neurotensions, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranged a traffic transporter amino neutral SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmemant protein, ACE2 works as the main point in the cell for some coronary, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COV-19).
More specificly, S1 protein bindings on spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 tons with ACE2 enzymeal domains on the surface of the cell resulting endositosis and virus translocation and enzyme into the endosom located in the cell.
The process of this virus also requires the protein S primitive by the protease inang TMPRS2, which is currently being investigated as potential therapy, this fact makes a person hypothesis that the ACE2 rate in the cell can help combat infection.
Yet, many professional and reguration communities recommend continued standard inhibitor ACE and ARB.
A systematic survey and metaalisis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "inhibitor inhibitor ACE caused a 34% significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with control."
Further, "ACE inhibitor use also lowers the risk of pneumonia on patients who have higher risks for pneumonia, especially patients with strokes and heart failures.
The use of the inhibitor ACE is also associated with the reduction of mortality associated with pneumonia, even though the results are less powerful than the total pneumonia risk."
ACE2 rekombiant humans (rhACE2) are expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase the hemodinamick lungs and the oxygen unit on the pigs with the acid breath syndrome that lipopicarida incited.
Time to put the rhACE2 on humans about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work instead of the length of 24-hour effects.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a cure promised for patients with intolerance to the inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (inhibitor RAS) classic or on disease with angiotensil II in the increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evacuated in a clinical test for my napast syndrome treatment.
b'Application COVID-19 is an application of cellular software designed to help track contacts to handle coronaviral pandems 2019-2020, which is a process identifying people ("tak") which may have been contacted with people infected.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some areas and jurisdiction.
Some jobs to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy problems are questioned, especially related to the system based on a relocation of the application user's geographical location.
Alternatives that do not water down privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the approach of the user with another cell phone.
On April 1020, Google and Apple together announced that they would infect the functionality to support those Bluetooth-based applications directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In Tiongkok, the government of Tiongkok, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in more than 200 cities of China. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.
This application is developed by the local TI community, released as an open source and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia launchs "StopKorna!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the display of the potentially infected people and to give quick responses to health care authorities.
These applications are developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Health Ministry.
Until 14 April 2020, the application was still waiting for Google Store and Apple App Store's approval.
On April 12 of April, the government declared that contact tracking applications are in progress and will be available to be distributed within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and BlueTrace protocols. The Russian means to introduce the geographing application for COVID-19 patients who live in Moskow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might happen on the application-based system, which includes false positives and the likelihood of lack of effectiveness if the data of limited applications are taken in a few populations.
In order to overcome anxiety about the spread of misleading or dangerous applications, Apple set limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus application to App Store, which means restricting only for the "resmi" organization or who have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
The supporters expressed their concern about mass surveying applications using coronavirus applications, especially about whether infrastructure surveys are made to handle the coronavirus pandemics will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling boundaries on such surveys.
This organization states eight conditions on the government project:
The surveys must be "corruption law, necessary, and proportional."
Monitoring and surveying need to have sunset clauses;
data usage must be restricted for COVID-19;
Security and anonymity of data must be protected and proved protected by evidence;
Digital surveys must avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
every division of data with the third party must be defined in the law;
There must be protection against the abuse and rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
participation means all "concerned interests" is required, including public health experts and the termaginal group. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) also issue checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to overcome the ongoing surveying problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operation system after not needed.
Some countries use network-based tracking, and not applications, to remove the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network - based tracking was approved.
The network-based solution that has access to the raw location data has a potential of significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access private locations data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been made and using center servers only for intercommunication (see the bottom).
In South Korea, an unbased system is used to track contacts.
In addition to using specific applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including the mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce notice through text messages to people who potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available for the public, which is allowed by a wide change in the laws of information privacy after the MERS in that country.
This information is available for the public through a number of applications and websites. German-like countries consider using both the focus system and the system that protect privacy.
To April 620, details haven't been published.
The tracking of contacts that protect privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of research literacy starting at least 2013. On April 7 April 2020, more than a dozen of scholars perform friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the approach of users with other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination attempt with the concentrated and neutralized approach, and not a single protocol. Undeceptive protocol includes a closeness Protecting PD-PPT/DP-3T, Temporary Contakation (TCN, previously called Concentral Genesis, CEN), Protocol and Protocol and Proxective Proxization Sancification for the Mobile Contaker (PAC) and other.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified can never leave the device, and all the matching occurs on the device.
Privacy Group in MIT Lab MIT develops SafePaths, platforms to use the technique that protect privacy while collecting and using location or alur intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released on March 2020. Other similar benefits are the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, company that developed privacy technology and was also established in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technologies to allow users to share location and health data sensitive to other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On April 5 of 2020, global TCN coalition was founded by groups who had basically the same approach and are the protocols that are largely overridden, with the purpose of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warnings applications, which are a major aspect of reaching vast reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application to be an open source.
On April 10 of April 2020, Google and Apple, company that controls the cellular platform Android and iOS, announced the initiative to track contact, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptographic technology that protects privacy.
They also publicize the core technology specification used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to launch in three stages:
tool launch to allow the government to make official tracking applications that protect privacy
Integration of this function directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to deal with data and surveying problems continue to distribute the system through operating system updates, and then remove it in the same way after the threat has passed.
The b'Reposition of drugs (as well called new purposes, new profiles, or new tasks on medicine or the exchange of therapy) is the use of medicine that has been approved for the purpose of new treatment, which is for disease or medical conditions different from the original purpose of developing drugs.
This path is a scientific research course that is currently being done to develop the safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Another study direction includes the development of COVID-19 vaccine and a convalent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has some ligan binding sites.

virus vectors (Fase I and vaccine candy: CanSino Biologics, inovirus vector type 5)
As reported by the CEPI scientists in April, the total 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stage of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and the other 37 were announced, but with little public information available (specified in planning or being planned).
Testing Fase I-II doing early security and immunogenisation test, usually being done randomly, controlling the plasebo, and in some locations, specifying effective doses more correct.
Testing Fase III usually involves more participants, including control groups, and testing vaccine effects to prevent disease, monitoring side effects on optimal doses.

Some vaccine has heterologist effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
It means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further tracking tests in Australia are trying to follow 4.170 health officials.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in the development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine generosity using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as acceleration rat ACE2-transgenic, other laboratory animals, and primates, shows the need for repelling steps to reach the biological security level 3 in handling the virus, and international coordination to ensure standard security procedures.
Vaccis against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
Until 2020, no cure or protective vaccine for SARS has proved safe and effective to humans.
According to the 2005 and 2006 published research, the identification and development of vaccine and new medicine to treat SARS is the priority of governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became prevalent, the SARS research is believed to be a useful template to develop vaccine and therapy for MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there's one MERS vaccine that completes the clinical test of I on humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, which are all virus-vectored vaccine, two invirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS), BVRS-GamVac, and one vector-MVAVAVAVA-MERS.
The social media posting has a conspiration theory claiming the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine has been available.
Patients quoted by various social media postings refer to the available patents for genetic security and vaccine for other coronavirus galvances, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'CUVID 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by heavy acid syndrome syndrome acid 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The common wave covered fever, coughs, and breaths.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of kiss, and abdomen.
Time from being exposed to normal symptoms of about five days, but it can start from two to twelve days.
Although most cases lead to minor symptoms, some develop into pneumonia virus and fail to hybrid organs.
Over 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, which have resulted in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have recovered.
Even though the droplet is produced when breathing, it usually falls to the ground or to the surface rather than contagious to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is very contagious for the first three days after the symptoms, even though the spread may occur before the symptoms occur and after the next disease rate. The standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the red-time polimerase transcription chain (rRT-PCR) on the nasofaring.
The mask use is encouraged for those who expected to be infected with the virus and those who care for it.
Recommendation about the use of masks by the public community differs; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend its use, and some others require its use.
Right now, there's no vaccine or antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been recorded in nearly all countries in the six regions of WHO.
People infected with viruses can have no symptoms or symptoms like flus, such as fever, coughs, fatigue, and breath packed.
Emergency waves include breathing trouble, pain or panic in the constant chest, confusion, confusion, hard to wake up, and lips; medical constant stimulation is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Upper breathing waves, such as sinks, gums, or throat pains can be found, but they are more rare.
The gastrointestinal wave, such as mual, vomit, and diarrhea, is observed in a variety of percentages.
Some cases in Tiongkok at first only with the clinis of the chest and the palpity.
In some individuals, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure to sympathize, and death.
It's called the immunity time.
The time incubation for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can start from two to 14 days.
97,5% of the vibrant people will have symptoms in 11,5 days of infection.
This unsavorable role in the infection is not fully known; yet, the initial evidence indicates that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, proporses of the infected people who do not show unconscious symptoms and are being studied, with Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centers (KCDC) report that 20% of all cases confirmed without symptoms during treatment in the hospital.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in his daily case on April 1; from 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and litter can carry the load of virus on a large scale.
Speaking out loud, letting out more splash or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets to move up to 15 feet (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not infected by air, the American National Science Academy suggests that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and the exclusion that is located outside the hall of a person produced a positive sample for the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and rebirth of the lung heart (RJP), can make the respiratory sensation turn into aerosol and spread through the air.
Even though there is concerns that the virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed to be low, the most contagious virus when people vibrate; even if the spread may occur before the symptoms arise, the risk is low.
European Disease Control Center (ECDC) says that although it is not fully obvious how easy this disease is to spread, one person usually infects two to three others.
Particularly, the virus can be detected for a day on the carton/cardus, for three days on plastic (polipropilen) and rust - resistant steel (A.S. 304), and four hours on copper 99%.
Yet, this varieties depend on humidity and temperature.
Sabuns and detergens are also effective if they are properly used; the product of soap describes the layers of viral fat, decompressions the virus, and releases it from skin and other surfaces.
Other strings, such as benzalkonium chlorida and chlorhexydin glucoonat, are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a light sample was taken in median two days after the inap mousquito.
On five out of six patients, the first sample shows the highest cargo of the virus, and the sixth patients show the highest supply of the first day’s virus in testing.
Coronavirus acute 2 syndrome syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy acid syndrome syndrome, which was first dissolved from three people with pneumonia related to the claster case of acute respiratory in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are on the coronavirus in nature.
Out of the human body, this virus is killed by the soap of the household, which ruins his protective bubbles, SARS-CoV-2 close to the first SARS-CoV.
Paru is the most attached organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesss the inang cells through angiotensic 2 enzymes (ACE2), the most abundant in the alveolar type II cell.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter an inang cell.
The acute heart condition was found on 12% of the infected people in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often on a severe disease.
The high rate of cardiovascular symptoms because of system inflammation and immune disorders during the development of disease, but the miokard injury may also be associated with the ACE2 reception in the heart.
ACE2 reseptor was expressed very high in the heart and involved in the heart function.
Insiden trombosis (31%) and tromboembolism poison (25%) high found on COVID-19 infection patients in ICU and may be associated with bad prognosis. Obtains on the people who died because COVID-19 found alveolar damage (AD) and inflate inflammation containing limfosit in the ru.
Even though SARS-COV-2 had tropicalme for the airline epitel cells that express ACE22, heavy COVID-19 patients have systematic hiperinflamation symptoms.
Specifically, the T-CSF patogen GM-CSF has proved to be in harmony with the monostic engineering of the IL-6 inflamatory and the deep lung pathological for patients COVID-19.
The limfositic infiltrates have also been reported on the autopsy.
WHO has introduced some test protocols for this disease.
Standard testing method is the reaction of the polymerase chain transcrypting real-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on a respiratory sample obtained through the nasofaring usap; yet, a nasal or sputum sample can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within hours of two days.
Blood test may be used, but it takes two blood samples taken by two weeks to have a small amount of time.
Illustrative Tiongkok cansolate this coronavirus galur and publicize its genetic state so that the laboratorium worldwide can develop a test of polimerase chain reactions (PCR) independently to detect infections by this virus.
On April 420, an antibodies test (who can detect active infections and if someone has been infected earlier) was in development, but not much used.
Tiongkok’s experience with the test indicates that it is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.
Base-glass multilocal opacity ifterated with perifer distribution, asymetris, and posterior are found a lot at the beginning of infections.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (screaming a lobular septum with variant alveolar fillment), and consoleidation can occur along with the development of disease.
A little data is available about microscopics and COVID-19 patopsy.
The primary pathological finding on the autopsy is:
Makroscopei: plastic, perichistics, lung console, and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia pneumonia virus can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocation hypplasia, large pneumocation pneumicot, interstisial inflammation with limfositic infiltration, and giant cell formation is largely infiltration
heavy pneumonia: difused alveolar damage (DAD) with fussed alvelous.
DOD is the cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hyphosemia.
pneumonia in healing level: external order in alveolar and phybrosis interstitial pneumoner
Blood: intravascular coordinates of inseminata (DIC); farcoeritroblatic reactions
Steps of prevention to reduce the possible infection include staying at home, avoiding the crowd places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, packing good respiratory higiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends shutting down the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or smoldering and recommending the use of the part of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene is the right hand after the cough or the typhoon is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of the cover of the facial cloth in the public, some to limit the exposure of people without symptoms.
Limitations also include people keeping at least 6 feet or 1,8 feet [6 m] away.
No known drugs are effective to prevent COVID-19. Because the vaccine is not expected until early 2021, the main part in handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce epidemic peaks, known as "rating the curves".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after rubbishing their nose, coughs, or greeks.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hands, which contain at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this formulation, antimicroba activity comes from etanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen of oxide is used to help eliminate bacteria' spectacle in alcohol; this is "not active substance for hand antisepsis".
Gliserol is added as humid.
People are treated with support, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are relashoned.
The CDC recommends those who suspect they have a virus to use simple facial masks.
Extracorporum membraneogenation (ECMO) has been used to cope with breathing failure, but the benefits are still considered.
Self - cleanliness and life - style and healthy diet are recommended to improve immunity.
The suportive treatment may be useful for people who have mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.
Intensive care members and lungs in the United States have organized treatment recommendations from various agencies to free resources, which are the IBCC.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical energy recommends parasetamomol instead of the motherprofen use of the first lin.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of viral infection, especially in health care order when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or ventilation of hands.
For health energy that treats COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person is put in the Tular-Udara Infact Isolation area instead of using standard prevention, contact prevention, and initial precaution. CDC sets out the guidance for the use of self-aid tools (APD) during the pandem.
The recommended equipment is: APD's coat, respiratory or mask of the face, eyebrows, and medical gloves, if available, breathing (not face mask) is better.
The N95 respirator approved for the industrial order, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used by the EAC usage Authority (EU).
The Respirator N95 was designed to protect from the nature of air particles like dust, but the effect of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for the use that is not mentioned in label.
If the mask is unavailable, the CDC recommends using facial shields or, as a last effort, the mask of its own.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until it needs mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are heavy.
The kind of breathing support for people who suffered failing in connection with COVID-19 is active for the insulated person, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided by a high flow canula of high streams or the social air salt pressure.
It's not known whether one of these two methods has the same benefit to the critical person.
Some doctors prefer to use the mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles than the canopy of high streams.
Many developed countries don't have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limit the health system capacity to handle the logging suddenly the number of COVID-19 cases that require a swamp.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% entered an intensive care unit, 2,3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of COVID-19 sufferers who are in the sun finally in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acid syndrome (ARDS) is happening on COVID-19 and oxygen is getting harder.
A ventilator who is able to perform high pressure control mode and PEEEEP is required to maximize the delivery of oxygen and minimize the risk of ventilation and pneumotoraks related ventilators.
A high PEP may not be available on the old ventilator.
Investigations about the potential for treatment began in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are in clinical tests.
Remdesivir seems the most promised.
Although new medicine development may take up to 2021, some tested drugs are approved for other use or are in further tests.
Antivirus drugs can be tried on people with a severe disease.
Volunteers who are recommended on WHO's efforts to test effectiveness and medical security. The FDA has provided temporary authorization for convalent plasma as experimental treatment in the case of a person's life very or incessantly threatened.
Convalent Plasma hasn't had the clinical study needed to prove its security and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok launched cellular applications to deal with the plague.
User requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect the contact using surveying data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-deed quantine, but also informs local health officials, a reference to the mobile phone data, facial recognition technologies, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track the infected and people who are contacted with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government permitted security bodies to track a person’s phone data that was expected to be traced to coronavirus.
The step was taken to treat quarantine and protect people who might have contact with infected citizens.
In addition, on March 2020, Deutsche Telkom distributed phone data to the German government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of virus.
Russians use facial introduction technologies to detect karantine crossroads.
Italian regional health company, Giulio Gallera, said he was told the cell phone operator that "40% of the citizens are still moving in place".
The German government is doing hackathon weekend 48 hours with more than 44,000 participants.
Besides, President Estonia, Kaljulaid Kersti, makes a global call for a creative solution against coronavirus spread.
People may experience pressure from quarantine, travel limitation, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor who says, "The growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic deterioration are perfect storms that endanger the mental and well-being of the community."
This disease can take lightness with little or no symptoms, which resemble the disease of other public breath channels, such as pileks.
A light case often heals within two weeks, while those who suffer from a severe or critical illness may take from three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is still less.
On the most severe people, COVID-19 can quickly grow into acid syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, sycapse, or failure in the comemic organs.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include synthesis, abnormal blood mass, and damage to heart, kidneys, and heart.
The lack of blood massage, especially the protrombin time increase, is observed at 6% of COVID-19 patients who are treated in, while kidney function disorders are visible at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of the people with the COVID-19 image indicate a heart enzyme increase (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median period between the events of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the mosquito.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a seven - day median period between the mosquito and the death.
In a study that studied early cases, the median began from the beginning to the death was 14 days, with a six - to 41 - day rations full.
In a study by the National Health Commission Tiongkok, men have 2.8% death numbers, while women have 1.7% death numbers.
Histopatology samples of postmortems show the alveolar damage is fused with a fibromiksoid in the second lung.
The sytopathic synopetic changes arematid on pneumost.
The lung image looks like an acute nausea syndrome.
At 11,8% of the death reported by the Tiongkok National Health Commission, heart damage, with increased troponin or heart breakdown.
According to March’s data from the United States, 89 percent of the people who were treated in the child have a basic condition, the availability of medical and economic resources can also affect mortality.
The estimated death rate of different conditions because of the differences in the area, but also because of the difficulty of metodology.
Less counting minor cases can cause death rates to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean the present mortality rate being counted too low.
Smokers have a possible 1.4 times bigger than COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely need intensive care or die than those who are not smoking.
The Hong Kong Hospital authorities found the reduction of lung capabilities 20% to 30% on some people recovering from disease, and the lung scans indicate organ damage.
It can also cause an intensive pascapedrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known that earlier infections gave effective immunity and long - term lengths to those who recover from this disease.
Imunity considered may be obtained, if you see another coronavirus behavior, but there's been reported the cure case COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a worse, not a red infection.
This virus is expected to be natural and come from animals, through widespread infections.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infections almost completely motivated by exposure from humans to humans.
A study of 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 of The Lancet, revealed the earliest known date of symptoms is 1 December 2019.
The WHO official publication reported the earliest symptomswits on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to count mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and with time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care, thetional options, the time since the first outbreak, and the population characters such as age, sex, and health total.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the ICD-10 emergency code of UARS-CoV-2, for the deaths of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed laboratorium infections and U07.2 for the death of COVIDs who were diagnosed chronically or epidemiology for laboratory infections of SARS-CoV-2.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death ratio of cases is 6,9% (153.822/2.240.191) per 17 April 2020.
The number is varying by the region. Another measurement includes the fatality of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died from certain diseases, and the fatality rate of infections (IFR), which reflect the percentage of people infected (diagnostic and undignified) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, antibodies can provide information about the number of people infected.
In the episentrum of the plague in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 citizens, 80 (1,7%) is dead.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through Karnaval festival, which spreads among young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19's death.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as the blood donor is tested.
69 people (0,004% of the population) are killed by COVID-19.
Pandemic effects and mortality are different for men and women.
Higher mortality to the man in the study done in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for a man is at the age of 50, with a few risks between a new man and a new woman didn't appear at the age of 90.
In Tiongkok, the number of deaths for men is 2,8 percent and for women is 1,7 percent.
A certain reason for the difference based on this kind of sex is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be a reason.
Differences of immunology based on sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have a hybrid condition, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected were men and 72% of the people who died because COVID-19 was a man.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government didn't track the data related to the type of sex for COVID-19 infections.
Research indicates that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The health conditional sensation is higher, especially the nurses, and they have a higher chance to show the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that this disease's official name is "COVID-19".
WHO WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is a shortage for crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the outbreak is identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is selected to avoid references to certain geographical locations, species of animals, or groups of people, along with international recommendations for stigmatization that are intended to prevent stigmatization. COVID-19 viruses are given the name of heavy acid syndrome syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2).
WHO also uses COVID-19 virus and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and the disease are commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for virus and disease according to 2015's guidelines that would not use the name in the name of disease and virus.
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the capacity in standard supply chain, some digital producers print such health - care materials as nasal and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is in need of ventilator valves, and the suppliers can't give it on the necessary time scale, a local-recognizant company and print the 100 valves needed in yesterday.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreaks, the conspiracy theory, the wrong information, and the disinformation of the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread quickly.
Humans seem to be able to spread virus to some other animals.
Studi failed to find evidence of replication on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There's no cure or vaccine approved to treat this disease.
International research on the vaccine and COVID-19 drugs are being done by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of the four-protective antiviral effects.
Vacsin has not yet been available, but various institutions are developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were equal to using ACE2 recipes to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of those viruses, either unactivated or dead, is intended to trigger quick human immunity responses to new COVID-19 infections.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to create vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to a particular subunit on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on S-spike proteins that help infiltrate the ACE2 envelope reactor.
The third strategy is the nucleat acid vacccine (the DNA or RNA vaccine, new techniques to create vacccination).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategic strategies must be tested to figure out its security and cooperation on March 16, 2020, the first clinic test of a vaccine begins with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains unprotected genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. The depending-antibodi growth has been recommended as a potential challenge to the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There's more than 300 active clinic tests in April 2020.
Seven trials are trying to evaluate treatments that have been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroroksiklorokuin or chlorokuin.
An antivirus drug given a new purpose makes up most of Tiongkok research, with nine tests of the Fase III at remdesivir in some countries with a reporting period at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic survey of clinical development for vaccine candidity and COVID-19 medicines are already available. Some of the antivirus drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, which includes remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxiclokuin, lopinavir/ritonvir, and lopinavir/ritavir are combined with interonavir.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for remdesivir's strength.
The clinic enhancement is observed on patients being treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Clinics Fase III is being done in the United States, Tiongkok, and Italy.
However, there is a call for review on the research.
Korean Health Authority and Tiongkok recommends the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that double doses are dangerous and can die.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation of emergency usage for hydroxiclokuins and chlorokuins of the doctor's policy that treats COVID-19. The 7th Chinese Translators also include interferon, onviron, or umifenovir to use against COVID-19.
Initial data indicates that onvirin high doses are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended for further research in vivo after showing SARS-CoV-2 servictation in low concentrations. Exposure shows that the primitive of the protein tons of transmembran 2 (TMPRS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE2 reactor.
The study of chlorokuins and hydroxiclokuins with or without azitromisin has a large limit that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research.
Sitokin storm complication can happen on COVID-19 heavy stages.
There is evidence that hydroxiclorokuin may have an antisitokin nature.
This drug is undergoing a second nonacact test on the national level in Italy after showing positive results on people with a severe disease.
Combined with the serum feritin blood test to identify sitokin storms, this drug was meant to resist sytokin storms, which was expected to be the cause of death to some people who were hauled.
In 2017, antagonist interleukin-6 receptionor approved by the FDA based on a retrocutative case for synthesis rejecting synths of sytokin refrakter steroids that were based on a different cause, which is the CAR T.
Until now, there has not been any random and controlled evidence that tocilizumabs are good treatments for the CRS.
Transfering a refined and spected antibodi that is produced by the system of people who are healed from COVID-19 to those who need it are being studied as nonvacsin immunization methods.
This strategy was tried for SARS with nonconclusive results.
Netralization virus is a work mechanism expected for passive antibodi therapy can issue defensive defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, another mechanism, such as cellular psychics that depend on antibodi and/or fagositosis, as well.
The form of other passive antibodies, for example, uses a produced monoclonal antibodi, in development.
Convalent serum production, which is part of a healthy patient’s blood and containing specific antibodies on this virus, can be increased to a quicker use.
coronavius disease, a closely related group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who was later infected and died because of COVID-19 after emitting the awareness of the spread of the virus.
