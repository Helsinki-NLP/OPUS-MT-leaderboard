Welsh MPs worry about ‘looking like puppets’
There was certain concern by some Members of Parliament regarding the change of their title to the MWP (Senator of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue was raised by plans to change the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress in the House of Representatives worry that this could be an issue that raises mixed opinions.
A Labour MP said his party was worried that "the phrase would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means feces.
A Plaid Party delegate pointed out that the entire Party was “not proud” and suggested other names.
One Conservative MP said his party had "no prejudice" about the name change, but did not forget to mention how the MWP abbreviation easily turns into Muppet (puppet).
The Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire letter u.
The Congressional Committee is currently drafting a bill regarding the name change, stating: “The final decision on any identification of the Members of Parliament will of course be of concern to the Delegates themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowers the Welsh parliament to change its name.
In June, the committee announced the results of a referendum on proposals to seek a consensus basis for naming the parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
Considering the title story of the Members of Parliament, the Committee favored the Welsh Parliamentarians or WMP, but the results of the referendum showed the Welsh Parliamentarians' bias.
Deputies are openly proposing other options, but efforts to reach consensus may be a concern for Elin Jones, who is tasked with submitting the amended bill in the coming weeks.
The amendment bill would include other changes to how Congress operates, including the removal of the Deputies and the design of the government apparatus.
Members of Congress will issue final votes on the question of what title they should be renamed when they comment on the amended bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of state name
Voters cast ballots on Sunday over whether they would change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The full-scale vote was set up in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly objected to EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition to the change of name, has vowed to repeal the results of the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the change was the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church fell silent as the crisis struck in Harlem.
“Historically, the old people I’ve met have said that every corner of the street has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there are no churches and no bars.”
He found that the disappearance of bars was acceptable.
He said that today "people have many ways to communicate."
“Bars are no longer public living rooms where people go to and from time to time.”
As for the churches, he feared that the proceeds from the sale of the property would not be as sustainable as the leaders had hoped "and that sooner or later it would all come back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with many of the locals’ apartments, which would not help in preserving the local sanctuary.
He added, “A significant portion of the people who buy apartments in those apartment buildings will be white people, and then the prospect of churches being closed will come faster than ever because there’s no sense in which the residents of those apartments will become parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a municipality for people of color - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, which became St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregations moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation of worshippers nearby took over the site.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a mall street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or urging people of color.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they set it up as a bell.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells "the bells of the poor".
The expert who ran the bells in July preferred to call it “a cultural treasure” and “an immutable historical treasure.”
Expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who chased the larger ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some given by lay leaders in the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The diocesan administration — the governing body of the parish, which includes lay leaders — referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese “will seek to transfer costs” to the diocesan administration, although they are not involved in hiring architects and contractors already mentioned.
Some parishioners are unhappy about the lack of transparency on the diocese’s side.
Shark attacks 13-year-old snorkeling lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp harvest, authorities said.
The incident took place before 7 a.m., just off Beacon's coast at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that he was driving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then they all swam out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a delightful scream when he caught the shrimp, but then “he realized he was screaming, ‘I’m bitten!
I was bitten!”
All of the boy's collarbone was exposed," Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
“I told people to get out of the water right now: ‘There are sharks there!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by plane to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was insured, in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack has not been identified.
Rescue worker Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that they spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but determined it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper body.
Officials closed the beach entrances from the Ponto Sea in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's UK beauty market entry strategy
Sainsbury’s is pushing for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its traditional showroom beauty booths, which are always attended by specialists.
As part of a massive push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homewares decline, larger beauty goods stalls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and scaled up to be tested in more stores next year if there are any positive signs.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to take advantage of stand replacements for TV counters, microwave ovens and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it is doubling the size of its beauty products to 3,000 for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brands such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space and branded areas similar to the in-store display at Boots.
The supermarket is also reinforcing its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of its products are pure vegetables – something increasingly sought after by younger customers.
Fragrance Shop will test the discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food on a daily basis at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets have to be more dedicated to attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said stalls will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to confront incentives from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and items.
Sainsbury’s, which has put Argos stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats stalls since they bought both brand chains two years ago, has driven grocery sales and made acquisitions more lucrative.
The supermarket had previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical arrays but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after problems related to the distribution of goods from supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceuticals to Celesio, owner of drugstore chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a part in the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will directly give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every demand and glamorous environment as well as convenient locations means we are now an attractive stopover, challenging the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been "outraged" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for her style franchise to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn’t have time for their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The couple’s business is like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, angering star Peter Jones as she withdraws from their super-profitable style brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own lucrative new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was “outraged” when the show’s golden girl admitted that her new deals — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m — meant that she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11m fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK for one of her vacation homes.
A source said: “For now, Truly is Holly’s top priority.
It should be her long-term future that could accompany her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave was astounding to the people involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which is very close to the premiere.
There’s an overflowing warehouse at Marlow Headquarters that’s ready to go.”
Experts believe the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions of dollars as it invests heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and furniture, and the possibility of delaying product launches.
This may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin became close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity host.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We will not comment on his business.”
It’s a great fight, and we love each other deeply.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from media outlets for making a comment that some would consider “not in authority” because he saw the North Korean leader as a good fit.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mock voice, “the show’s host.”
"I give up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump praised it as a major step forward in denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Ministry chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic outlook in his campaign speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We’re in this good relationship now.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of U.S. military personnel to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is missing, no declaration of national disaster has been made, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very decisive in not asking for international aid, so that’s very challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to move to Palu, it’s unclear whether foreign employees can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the ongoing quakes that Indonesia is experiencing, the country has not been prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, such places are not common in other locations.
Although the warning is effective, the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu is likely to lead to human losses.
At peak times, moving between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Disasters make logistics work even more complicated.
An ambulance train has stayed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims trying to reach Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s aging infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign and he has squandered funds on roads and railways.
But a financial shortage has made it difficult for Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from unfinished sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands washed away from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge brings a draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea when his team was 1-0 ahead.
He handled the ball with his left foot before launching a shot into the long vertical column.
Scoring and heading to the top right corner of the goal.
The ball crossed the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew straight into the net.
“I’m just in the right position, getting the ball and the players including Shaq are always trying to jump up so I just have to try to jump up,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, so I handled a touch and shot without much hesitation.”
Chelsea led nearly half of the game after the opening scoring of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this phase, the Royal Cavalry forward passes the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the midfield and rushing onto Liverpool's pitch.
Kovacic had a wall from the middle of the field.
He had a beautiful slot, heading towards Hazard, who was rushing into the zone.
Hazard eliminated the defence and finished with his left foot in the corner, overtaking Liverpool’s Alisson Becker.
The Champions League group stage match between Liverpool and Napoli will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge on Tuesday at 3pm in London.
Indonesian tsunami casualties have reached 832.
The death toll from the quake and waves in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center announced early Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the wreckage of buildings brought about by Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, dragging waves as high as 20 feet, center spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is engulfed in the rubble of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing woman
After the body of a woman was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, an investigation into the murder has begun.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7.55am in Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, after which a 32-year-old male suspect was arrested.
Police called on locals if they saw or heard anything, to report it.
Investigators Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its first stages but I urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to notify us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also call on anyone, especially the drivers, if they accidentally saved anything from the angles of the journey to contact us as they may have obtained important information for our investigation.”
Police said the woman was identified as a local resident of Birkenhead and the body was found inside the house.
This afternoon, several people were reported to have had sex with the woman who arrived at the scene to give a statement about where the victim had been in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to return home, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn’t say a word when he found out.

Parliament’s Cromwell Statue Becomes Newest Monument to Suffer ‘Rewrite History’ Story
The banishment would be like a streak of justice to the Taliban’s destruction by many of his Puritan fanatics, who destroyed countless British structures and religions.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s words as “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The debate over leaving the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside of Westminster Palace is inevitable.
The symbol of the British Civil War was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell’s wrongdoing would have been replaced by the actions of his father Thomas in the last century.
The representative of Cromwell, Sir William Hamo Thassycroft, is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of honour.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than now, Cromwell is considered by many to be a guardian of parliament against external pressure, in his mind of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a perfectly accurate example of the topic in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell is a typical figure in the divide.
His accomplishments as Protector of God are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Killer Pigs Attacking Chinese Farmers
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, known as “Yuan,” was found dead with a severed artery, full of blood, near a cage in a market in Lubana Shui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly moved with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he had died, and saw a door in the pigsty next to him open wide.
He said there was a large boar in the barn with blood stains around his snout.
The report of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked the farmer to death.
“My brother’s two legs were bloody and not intact,” the cousin, known as “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Images from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not the pig in the herd of pigs.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market’s governing body are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although uncommon, cases of pig attacks on humans have been previously documented.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pressed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife frightened the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the smell of blood can act as a “bait.”
“They just want to be close.
“They’re reserved, they’re curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just need to love them properly,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves toward cooler ocean currents on Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 Hurricane, as of 05:00 a.m. Eastern Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday when a tropical cyclone forms, it will begin to carry much of the humidity of the north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring as much as 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, humid temperatures encountered with low pressure will cause heavy rainfall to spread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous flash floods, streams of debris and even the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Moisture temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at major sites, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in the southwestern regions, especially across large areas of Arizona.
Flash flooding can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation will be extremely daunting if you venture to walk into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into violent rivers and thunderstorms that will carry local gusts and dust cyclones.
The low pressure will bring some local heavy rains to many parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, easily causing streams of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the region’s first rainfall during the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains began pouring into Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rains became more common late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Some extreme temperatures can be seen across the United States in October when the Arctic is cooler, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature at nearby localities.
A typical example of a significant temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference is almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will be renewed and strengthened again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common in about 80 in the Southern Plains to the northeast.
New York City temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term weather forecasts are suggesting that temperatures will be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s hearing on six television networks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute news on Friday: a deal put in place by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100 percent certain that it would not happen.
It’s likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, Nielsen pointed out in Friday’s report.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately included with other broadcasters including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has some problems when it comes to calculating the viewers in the office.
In reference to the correlation, the number of spectators is similar to that for a final ticket match or the Oscars.
Fox News, the host who strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all broadcasters with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There is still a lot of concern after the hearing.
Flake is the central figure in Friday’s noise.
After the Republican moderate had just announced that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was watched by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters yelled at him as he tried to move in an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when questioned, broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he told the truth to the whole country?”
He was accused of saying, “You have power when too many women are powerless.”
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had issued a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations will have hours of live coverage afterwards, as the Judiciary Committee will have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh is nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, something some in the minority Democrats had urged.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice carries weight, as it’s clear that Republicans won’t get Kavanaugh’s approval vote without an investigation.
Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May rebuts 'political card' criticism of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed criticism of her plans to leave the European Union as a “political deck” for Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Session in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, emphasized his retaliation to their so-called Chequers deal on Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “absolutely unreasonable.”
Wayde Sims shot down: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who plays for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims dropped glasses during the clash.
Police discovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, according to CBS's WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Regional Autopsy Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound from the head to the neck.
The department is counting on the Louisiana State Police, the anti-escape task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and regional residents to assist with the investigation.
LSU’s physical director, Joe Alleva, thanked the regional legal authority for “the diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims is only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 shots per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "depressed" and "stunned" by Wayde's death.
Mr. Wade said: “That’s what you’re going to have to keep an eye on.”
Volcanic ash in Mexico City.
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has flowed to neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater became active and they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring a lot of fluctuations and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash blurring windshields in Mexico City’s neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands took part in protests marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession on both sides.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in the often crowded streets of tourists.
The chaos erupted at the end of the day when police used batons to suppress the fight.
For hours, the pro-independence faction chanted "No forgetting, no forgiving" against protesters who protested the words, "Spain is great."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the independent-thinking region a year after the October 1 referendum, which was illegal for Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Independent voters were overwhelmingly popular, despite their low approval ratings with anti-secessionists largely boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the vote from taking place at polling sites in the region amid intense clashes.
Pro-independence factions camped through the night on Friday to prevent a rally in support of the national police.
The protest took place before but had to take place with other developments.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist rally with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia's prospects of independence.
“Last year we had some of the happiest moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy when I was able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite narrowly winning important regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence factions have struggled to stay motivated this year with many of their most prominent leaders either being expatriated or detained pending trial for their role in holding the subsequent independence referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to the police support demonstration with her phone, said the conflict had been quelled by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison since late last year, announced he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Participating as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested for driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There were shots pointed at the car at some point.
Menga’s shot brought a 1-0 win for Livingston over Rangers
Dolly Menga's lead helped Livingston win
Livingston is up to surprise the Rangers when the Ibrox home team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s scoring proved different when Gary Holt’s side raised the level with Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's side have yet to score a separate goal in the Premier League this season and face the Hearts, who lead eight points, on Sunday.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his unbeaten run in six games, as head coach Holt has tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to play against the underdogs.
Holt's team should have been ahead before they scored, with their tactics facing the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson struggled but overcame the goal, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts more vigorously after leading the ball to Craig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts are confident to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause trouble for the away team with individual techniques.
And that's the strategy for the scoring shot.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston took the lead, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up towards Menga, who had a touchdown and scored right in the middle of the goal.
At this point, the Rangers had the upper hand in holding the ball but found the defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no difficulty.
The match continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos was assisted by Kelly.
Scott Pittman lost at the feet of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow switched to another Livingston play scenario.
The balls repeatedly entered Livingston’s goal and were repeatedly caught, with two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge to his replacement Glenn Middleton, one for touching the ball – successfully blocked.
'Label Label' with Livingston - analysis
from BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A good result and a good match for Livingston.
The team is very good, continue to go far ahead in the backwards.
Their playing style and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top, but significant credit has to be paid to Holt for the way he has honed the team since his appearance.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett was the overarching, arranging a well-organized line of defense, while Menga consistently retained Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Just as they did under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
The flawed final shot – the only chance to open the home side – and it was a wake-up call for the Rangers, who landed in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives many shades of welcome in Cologne
There were smiles and favorable weather on Saturday as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at mending ties between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the inauguration of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The bipolar protests reflected the split of a guest hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and cursed by others as a despot.
Deptford accident: Bicyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist died in a car collision in London.
The crash occurred near the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, a busy neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a crash and fled on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Roads are blocked and buses are diverted and participants are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in riots
Six employees were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the prison officer said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin HMP Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" specialists were sent to deal with the chaos, which ended at around 5:30 p.m.
Officers were searched at the scene with minor injuries.
A spokeswoman for the prison administration said: “Specialized training prison staff have been deployed to deal with what is happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured workers have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
HM Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the Prison Superintendent had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious riot in which officers were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding
It’s rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen as early as next week as Hurricane Rosa’s energy streaks over the Southwest Desert remain, leading to flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service released flash flood tracking Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Hurricane Rosa was expected to follow in a straight line across Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there were thunderstorms.
The National Meteorological Department in Phoenix mentioned in a brief report that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed a tropical cyclone or tropical depression within 200 miles of reaching Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of making landfall on the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the latest National Hurricane Center predict high rainfall of about 2 to 4 inches, with segregated flooding levels of up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, will likely be 1 to 2 inches, with segregated flooding levels up to 4 inches.
For areas not flooded by sudden flooding, the rain from Hurricane Rosa could be a good omen because the region is in drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some waterfalls can be happily welcomed as the southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the lowest level of extreme drought, but it is still the second highest in the same category.
First, the passage of Hurricane Rosa leaves landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still within storm range at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit cooler ocean currents in the Pacific Ocean and weakened.
As a result, forecasts suggest there will be landslides in Mexico as the tropical depression passes through on Monday evening.
The amount of rainfall falling on parts of Mexico could be significant, signaling the likelihood of flooding.
According to Weather.com, “Total rainfall is estimated to be between 3 and 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which could be as high as 10 inches.”
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical cyclone before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday in the form of a tropical depression, which will then sweep through Arizona and make landfall in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main predicted danger from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash flooding and life-threatening flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Murder Suspects Have Been Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of deliberate murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace at Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have urged everyone to report any footage related to the incident to the press.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the selfishness, anger' of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh confronted Congress on Thursday, strongly denying a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed the excellence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm that one of the most eminent legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a genuine public service résumé,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections of my life.
I'm not running, but I'm running." He shared.
“That’s why I go everywhere fighting for good candidates.”
Trump said Democrats wanted to “restrain and hinder.”
“The first core procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday,” a senior Republican leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, damages rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed away as huge waves hit beaches, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered during a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves as high as six metres (18 feet) slammed onto the shore at dusk, sweeping many dead and wreaking havoc on everything in its path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still participating in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB), said in a statement.
“The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, wood, houses, sweeping through everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before landing on the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque submerged in water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A string of earthquakes has been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Applications Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may not have stopped along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media was "completely paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the tragedy can become much more horrific,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for failing to announce that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the wave had come by the time the warning was issued.
In a non-professional video posted on social media, it was possible to hear a tall man screaming in panic to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water flooded the shore, sweeping along buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that caused a communication rupture around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun dispatching cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced people still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuees in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to more than 800
It's very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were staying in the tarpaulins erected in the office yard, they were passing through destructive scenes on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that highly specialized foreign aid workers had been prevented from moving to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to be implemented if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ then we can be ready with international assistance, but there is no word yet.”
As Monday night descends on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracle of assembling the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Brother Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran of the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon recalled that within hours of news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse spreading among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to rivals in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message only indicates a gray check instead of two blue checks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 when the ATM was loaded at Newport in Levee.
According to the Newport Police Department, the robbers took $26,750 from a Brink bank employee as they were loading money into an ATM at Newport in Levee.
The driver had cleared the ATM in the entertainment area and was preparing to hand over more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
While he was busy, a man “came from behind the Brink staff” and took away the bag of money that had to be delivered.
Witnesses reported seeing multiple suspects loitering around the scene, but police have not yet determined the number of suspects involved.
Anyone with information about the identity of the suspect is welcome to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: “Everyone knew I was Kanye West before.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and using the name is the eighth album to be released in June.
The change took place prior to his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was a guest on the show on behalf of singer Ariana Grande when she reported herself as "emotional disorder", the show's creator said.
As well as the abbreviation in his current stage name, West had previously said the word was religious to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible the word means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I’m your friend, I’m us, it’s us.
The transition from Kanye, which means only, to Ye – the reflection of the good, the bad, the worry, all the rest.
The album is more than a reflection of ourselves.
He was one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he is targeting Love and Brother Love.
One artist who has worked with West, JAY-Z, is also wondering if there are dashes and capitals.
Mexico's president says he won't send troops against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country moves toward the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “never put the army down on the Mexican people.”
The army opened fire during a peace rally in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities have led young people to become involved in evils.
The U.S. should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and practitioner who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even while the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, unveiled its plan last year: the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget would be a positive start, as all other countries are very far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubled funding could double the chances that the next massive AI achievement will be done in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
During the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat the highest-ranking U.S. Othello player, then served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the director of Google's China branch.
Lee approaches past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Projects Research Agency’s Robot Challenge and cares about when the next competition will take place, to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is calling for academics to take the lead; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically issued to PhDs on AI.”
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: “China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to people belonging to academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation and other government institutions subsidize U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to intervene with industry and education partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
This month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Directorate announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen a move in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of state name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece aimed at preventing entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insisted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and vetoed joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the newly proposed name, but opponents of nationalism argued that the change would undermine the national identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts over whether voters would meet at least 50 percent of the requirements for the referendum’s validity.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the deal with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to pay to pursue joining institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje, said: "Today I came to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it is towards a safer life for all of us."
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change would require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last year’s parliamentary election when 66 percent of voters registered to vote.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, of Skopje, said: “I’m going to vote for my children, because our position is in Europe.”
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on a change of state name that would pave the way for NATO and European Union accession in Strumica, Macedonia, Sept. 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small podium and pulling chairs in front of a tent erected by people who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: "We support NATO and the EU, but we want to participate in the main road, not through the back door."
“We are a poor country, but we are poor.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move on to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian link.”
Zaev said NATO membership would bring urgent investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “vote” would be “an affirmation of our future.”
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum — well below the required vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted yes.
A successful referendum must have a vote rate of 50 percent and one vote.
The defeat in the referendum represents the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since last May.
Spurs: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City pierced the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed the class with the scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward receives the pass from the middle of the field when starting the ball.
He chased ahead of three Brighton defenders before breaking into the empty field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.
He chased up a defender before thwarting the other opponents at the edge of Brighton.
Pass to the left, directing the ball to Sterling.
The Englishman gave his first touch in the penalty area to Aguero, who hit his right shoe with a shot to knock out Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has suffered some leg injuries.
"We talked about letting him play for 55, 60 minutes.
It happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to the Blue Shirt players in the Premier League.”
The score was in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's wing during the match.
He sent an extreme ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane with a few balls before leading Sterling to the title.
The Blue Shirt forward put the ball into the net just before the ball slipped out of control.
The Champions League match between City and Hoffenheim takes place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to burn himself up against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the final round of competition, there was not much reason to start over.
But a belligerent Scherzer hopes to win the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense as there is room for the Rockies, who lead a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the top spot.
“Although playing is pointless, at least we get to throw the ball when we learn about the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams that will play at whatever level I can play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in a fight like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce the opening player for Sunday's game, but it looks like Scherzer will be tossing the ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who kicks off his 34th start, will have pitching practice on Thursday and play on his Sunday break.
Washington's right-hand man scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs (average runs) and 300 strikes in 220 two-thirds of matches this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president detailed the situation around his Supreme Court, selecting Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections of my life.
This is one of the big, big things – not running but running is the reason I’m going everywhere fighting for good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re going to see the negative, extreme, negative Democrats that are here right now.
And they are determined to suppress their power by using any trick, and then you will see selfishness, trickery.
They don’t care who gets hurt, they have to step over who gets power and control, they just want power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
He added, "The Democrats are trying to 'restrict and obstruct'."
“You’ve seen that in the last four days,” he added, arguing that the Democrats are “angry and selfish and tricky and deceptive.”
He pointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s decision on Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which was buzzing from the bottom.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak any information?
What?
No, oh no, I expected – it was not an excellent kind of body language – but the worst kind of body language I’d ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Giving an opinion is unacceptable.
I was not surprised when the activists of Momentum, in my local party, voted to censor me.
After all, I was the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be told I wasn’t welcome—for raising an opinion.
As a member of Congress with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was determined to support oppositionism.
In my case, the censorship move was directed at me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a large-scale economic policy, on national security, in Europe, similar issues ironically disagree with previous leaders.
Notifying the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For nearly eight years as a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, Friday night’s Leadership meetings have all been the same.
Sadly, today, it’s not the tone in many meetings and the promise of “better, gentler” politics that has long been forgotten and really whether that has ever begun.”
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and that every opinion is evaluated as to whether the party’s leaders will accept it.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as former colleagues I think who share my political views have begun to expect me to change my mind and take on positions that I would never approve of – whether on national security or the EU market directive.
Whenever I speak publicly – and indeed no matter what I say – it entails abuse on social media calling for removal, denouncing central politics, telling me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who feels that way.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are politically oriented.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away from it.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is that the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cherish a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that open party and with every move of “unconfidence” or change in the rules of choice, the party has become narrow.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the last two years about urging me to stay calm, not to say too many words and then I’ll be okay.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was just a boy, I was motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my holistic school to collapse, I sought to bring better public services to those who needed them most – whether local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
“No one in Nottingham East can be misled about my policy positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who pushed the move on Friday, all I want to share is that as the country sucks on Brexit, which will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party Leader.
But really, a message outside of Nottingham Momentum that I stand by, to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of elimination or any political means that will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of my relatives.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Ayr unbeaten lead
The latter two attempts may have falsified the final result, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to win this eye-opening Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only crown of the ten teams.
In any case, it is also their super defence, as well as as as many as the better chances for them, that the hosts and coach Peter Murchie are absolutely right to be satisfied.
He said: "We have been through our games so far and we are still unbeaten, so I am satisfied."
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "In recognition of Ayr, they seize better opportunities than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute scoring, added by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show his skills and Jason Baggot to deliver the ball to the goal.
Climo took the lead over Ayr with a penalty, before, in the first half, he scored then added points with a solo, raising the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot added points, shortening the score to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was lagging behind, and since rebooting, Ayr had a superior lead thanks to Stafford McDowall's strike, Climo added points.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then yellow-carded, and once again, Melrose made the player sideline with a Bruce Colvine non-scoring extra, under a strained pressure.
However, the home team was back, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow carded for playing against Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored on the team's support advantage of Ayr.
Climo added points, as he had done almost since his return, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's pitch and passed it to winger Gregor Henry after the home team's fifth score.
The movie star Still Game is about to embark on the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to move into the hospitality industry after learning he was seen as the director of a licensed restaurant company.

Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail out to the Pacific once again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most flamboyant in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, solidarity and calm, and of course expects in a positive view of the results.”
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intense exchanges, Chile has a negotiating obligation to give Bolivia a sovereign sea access.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincing orthodox president who faces a fierce debate to run for re-election next year – also has more cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted, “We’re going back to the Pacific.”
But some analysts argue that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia – and this is less likely to change.
The U.N. with its headquarters in the Netherlands has no authority to return the territory to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s verdict came just six months after the final debates showed the situation was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And beyond Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years could be reversed.
Zárate said: “The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian authorities.”
She added that Morales’ belligerent statements have cut off any remaining goodwill from Chile.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual interest disagreements.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – was using maritime affairs as a political lifeline.
Bolivia added: "Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific."
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to walk through the past.”
North Korea says there will never be nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never disarm nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington beforehand.
Ri delivered a speech Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises during a summit in Singapore between leaders of the two sides.
He made remarks as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be preparing to restart nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "dream of vanity" to continue U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang making notable first-hand disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is no slight skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal it could see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion launches its latest line of wide-brimmed hats coming across major streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely stay out of the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a series of unusually large headwear designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that will stun the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
Unapplied hats swept Instagram this summer and the designers brought their eye-catching creations to the runway.
Valentino’s highlight is a beige hat over the top of the wide-brimmed head attached with feather-like accessories, covering the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include a whimsical watermelon, a witch hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are stitched lips in a way that resembles Hannibal Lecter rather than high-end fashion.
One design resembles a scuba diving device complete with snorkels and goggles, while another looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep catching on in the giant fashion direction – then you’re in luck.
Fanfarers predict that big hats may be coming all over the major streets near you.
The large hats became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’ shoes, the few inches wide-brimmed hat used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The adoring brand behind the ultra-unrealistic hat that popped up across social media brought another big creation to the runway – a beach-sandbag nearly the size of a bathing suit.
The burnt orange raffia fiber bag, bordered by raffia yarn with white leather handles, is a highlight of Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big-sized hats and beach bags flooding the major streets next summer – as the designer has made such an impact that it’s hard to ignore the need for high-size accessories.”
John Edwards: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain their academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with a rewarding stream of academic achievements, strengthened both individually and collectively in terms of sport, art, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are sponsored by the Scots Private Schools Council (SCIS), are working to deliver the best quality of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to equip students with deep and broad knowledge, as well as career orientation and status as global citizens.
As an education subdiscipline that can design and run the school’s unique curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continuing to be a popular and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in the language he understands, what he says goes into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what he says will come into his heart.”
This is a convincing message that we don’t rely solely on English when it comes to establishing relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading the charts with the best grades in private school subjects.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than A.
Data collected from the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored more than an A in Chinese, while 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French, and 63 percent learned Spanish.
This suggests that Scottish private schools are moving towards treating foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will not be able to miss in the future.
Elective language courses are being considered as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Skills and Occupations Council in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers have difficulty finding people is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, foreign language skills are becoming more practical in order to equip young people to enter the professional practice in the future.
With more and more opportunities for foreign language career prospects, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will gain a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the language of the native speakers, a polyglot will obviously lead every challenge.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple assembly in another foreign language, and French was the only foreign language to account for a unit-row number, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in foreign language teaching is essential for children today.
Being multilingual, especially in the languages of developing economies, will equip children with the brighter potential to find a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important for the UK in the 2020 vision, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever children are interested in, there are a variety of foreign languages to choose from in private schools, along with a team of teachers with expertise in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be extremely important to the future of the country, this should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to Scottish youth: diversity and excellence.
There's no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron made his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play the first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
How long he will be in the game is not yet known.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website: "It will be in under 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell shared that there is a possibility that James will be in the game for a limited time.
Watching the training of the week, James was asked about plans for a six-match pre-season fixture at the Lakers.
He said: "I don't need to play a few pre-season warm-up matches at this stage of my career.
President Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins his campaign.
It will be the first of Trump’s five campaign stops next week, including in support states such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote to approve his nominee for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is delayed, with President Trump trying to enlist support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote begins in November.
President Trump's campaign in West Virginia starts at what time tonight and how can you watch it online?
President Trump's campaign in Wheeling City, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7pm Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee who now faces sexual assault charges and the Senate approval vote must be postponed by a week for the FBI to proceed with its investigation.
However, the main purpose of these mass campaigns is to enlist support for Republican candidates ahead of November’s elections.
According to Reuters, the campaign’s goal is to pass five campaigns next week to “encourage Republican volunteers and supporters in the race to defend and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Congress control is an important issue on the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Planned to take place in Wheeling City's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also attracting Pittsburgh media to report," the West Virginia Metro News radio station said.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in the past month to West Virginia, a state he won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee for West Virginia State Senator, who is now behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, said: “The fact that the president has to visit the state to enlist support in the vote for a candidate is not a good sign for Morrisey.”
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination to fight for cup holders in singles matches on Sunday
After three unbalanced matches, the doubles match on Saturday afternoon may be essential for the Ryder Cup.
A pendulum-style wrist swing to create momentum is a completely new sporting concept, but also a move that athletes really believe in, especially in games like this one.
So where is the current momentum?
“They were six points ahead, now they are four, and I think that’s the motivation for us,” said Jordan Spieth as he took a relaxing stroll.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, four points ahead, and they have 12 games left.
As Spieth says, the U.S. team still has some hope and they are very encouraged, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have been paired many times and each has won three points.
Spieth is a veteran golfer in the dribbling from the dribble to the hole and he always leads as an example.
The screams of joy grew louder as he reached his round, especially the kick to equalize the match when he and Thomas hit the ball in turn into the hole.
The 15th match win was similar, which means that he fully believed in the US team’s comeback.
Spieth said: “You have to think hard and worry about your own game.”
All the athletes left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
For the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable Ryder Cup legend, have been the only couple to score higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This quirky but respectable pair of European teams have won 4:0 and can not make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the following nine holes on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the crowd of cheering fans gave the feeling that the two of them were the ones to beat on Sunday; and there was no player more deserving than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at sunset on Le Golf National.
Hopefully, both of you will appear in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to confirm the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, in pairing with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes caused the Spaniards and Swedes to completely lose the chance to counterattack.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one will be able to pull them out of that defeat.
Fourball and foursome matches are always the most worth watching because of the interaction between the duo, their advice and observing the game strategy change in just a split second.
The European team played better as a team and had a long lead before the final day, but this foursome series showed that the U.S. still had a chance to win.
The European team leads 10-6 before the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will take advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup after a spectacular series of fourballs and foursomes, leading the U.S. 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage by winning two Tiger Woods games to win an additional four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, determined to regain the trophy to his friend at Hazeltine two years ago, overwhelmingly won the US side in the morning fourball, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team performed better in the foursome series, winning two games, but failing to win the final.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in Sunday's singles series to win back the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win 4 points in a row as he and Molinari, commonly known as the "Molliwood" pair, were the second pair after the dramatic weekends in which they won four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball match, they had an even more convincing win over Woods and US rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had flashy moments, but so far, he has lost 19 of 29 in the fourball and foursome series, including seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning’s fourball series back with Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked 1st and 3rd in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, despite the extremely pleasant weather in southwestern Paris, the European team did not have an easy day.
The three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won a convincing 2&1 win over Spanish players Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team led by four points could start singles matches, although Furyk could hold the cup with a tie.
After only being considered second in two days, Sunday will most likely become a backwater for this team.
North Korea says 'no way' unilateral disarmament in lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions are still being maintained and deepening its distrust of the United States and that there is no way the country will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly's annual session, said North Korea had taken "many goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test bases and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see the same move from the US side," he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S. side, we won’t be able to guarantee our national security with confidence, and in such a situation, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s familiar complaint that Washington refuses to dismantle its nuclear weapons “in stages” and that North Korea will reap the corresponding benefits of doing so step by step, his remarks this time have a notable point of not refusing to unilaterally dismantle nuclear weapons as Pyongyang has previously refused.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In this statement, Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes calls for easing harsh international sanctions against Tien.
“The United States insists on ‘disarmament of nuclear weapons first’ and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its objectives in a coercive manner, even opposing the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is just the dream of those who don’t understand us.
But the problem here is that the sanctions that are still in place continue to lose our trust.”
Ri made no mention of plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the disarmament negotiator is South Korea, not the United States, then the denuclearization talks on the Korean Peninsula will not go to a standstill.”
However, Ri’s tone was different from last year, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s missile launch on the U.S. mainland was inevitable in a suicide mission after Trump called Kim “Rocket Man.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for taking courageous steps to disarm it, but he stressed that much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a deadline for the move: “Two years, three years, five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must continue to be enforced in a strong and uncompromising manner until we can confirm the results of complete denuclearization, finally, with verifiable evidence.”
The Security Council has agreed to intensify sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo held talks with Ri on the sidelines of official U.N. General Assembly meetings and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the final results were not very promising.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said the talks had made certain progress, but only hours later North Korea accused the foreign minister of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea has pledged to hold a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States makes a “similar move.”
He said Chairman Kim directed that the “similar move” he was seeking was the security assurance Trump had pledged during the talks in Singapore and moved toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a full rest course
In an effort to combat a culture of machine-pressured learning, with night owl students drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Research students at this world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course and he himself believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for starting this course came after he took part in a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
“At the end of the talk, a student came up to me and said, ‘Why didn’t you know this until the last year?’
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits that improve academic and athletic performance, while also improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding students with severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course covers a wide range of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a dorm room image in which students can click on coffee cups, curtains, workout machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, how light and sleep deprivation affect the results of exercise, as well as the importance of forming a bedtime routine.
In another part, participants were examined how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the university campus map, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” Czeisler added.
He said the "night owl student" pride culture still exists, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation being an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, good quality sleep should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into a state of hunger, leading us to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Czeisler design the course and took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him ‘open his eyes’ and inspired him to make an effort to call for a course throughout the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to join a similar program before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider when setting alarms for bedtime and waking hours, while also being aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga knocks out Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day when Dolly Menga's counterattack caused Steven Gerrard's side to lose 1–0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox home team hoped to mark their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach, extending an eight-point gap over the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts lead.
Menga maintained the offensive position for seven minutes before the end of the first half, but Rangers' temperament seemed to have never been crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed to 3rd place, and only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And Rangers had to deal with another problem after border referee Calum Spence had to treat a head injury after a clear object was thrown from the sidelines.
Gerrard changed the line-up eight times over the team that surpassed Ayr to reach the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, kept his Livi 11 draw and took a point against the Hearts last week and must have been thrilled with how his students besieged their opponents in each attack.
Although Rangers have more balls, Livingston is the only team that can really put the ball in danger.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after Menga first threw Scott Pittman on the pitch, attacking Allan McGregor’s goal but the midfielder missed this opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to the foot of captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow could only bring the ball to the back of the goal.
Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their play is mostly based on hope rather than belief, especially in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he would have to get a penalty on the penalty spot because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers scored only twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely struggled with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was arguably advantageous, no one can deny that their victory was entirely worth it.
Once again, Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs' deep-edged throw.
Scott Arfield failed to react when Declan Gallagher poked the ball for Scott Robinson, and Scott calmly chose Menga to make the simple finish.
Gerrard immediately took the option during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this replacement almost immediately had an impact when the winger poked the ball for Morelos but Kelly was impressed by immediately blocking the direction of the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in drawing the visitors in exactly the way they wanted to play, as Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly rolled out long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to take the lead in the last minutes of the match, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right spot to stop Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
The Rangers' newcomer Glenn Middleton again appealed for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but was again rejected by Thomson's referee.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and CONTINUE TO...future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of radiation detection and measurement, inventing the foundation for the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become a mainstay of science, but also a mainstay of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the film "Bells of Coronado", which premiered in 1950, starring scientist and cowboy king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the radioactive atoms in the minerals.”
Evans: “Yeah, there’s a clash here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name remains with time.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System How to ‘Watch’ Broken Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach The Immune System How To ‘Watch’ Broken Cells And Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This method involves taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab.
These cells can then ‘see’ the protein that is common in many cancers and be reinjected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is showing positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine taught her immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappeared after more than 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can “see” the protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, and then the cells are reinjected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
HER2 “promotes the development of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar study, which took immune cells from a patient’s body and “taught” them how to target cancer cells, once worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye receives more "stone bricks" for showing frantic support for President Trump, wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after Saturday Live Music Night (SNL)
Things didn't go well.
Kanye West got booed in the studio during SNL Music Night, after his rambling performance. During the performance, he praised US President Donald Trump and confirmed he would run for office in 2020.
After finishing performing the third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he angrily expressed his opposition to the Democrats and insisted on supporting President Trump.
“So many times I talk to my white friends and they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a miniseries starring Matt Damon. In the film, the Hollywood star sarcasms Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although the show was not broadcast, footage of West's angry speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear whether Rock deliberately mocked West when posting this.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable being behind the wing because of his hat.
“They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go up with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they said I was bogged down,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you know what it means to be bogged down?", he asserted, "to wear my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
Be loving."
Variety reported that his statement caused the audience to boo at least twice, and the member of SNL was confused, with one saying: "The whole studio is silent."
West was chosen as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West made many people confused with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received the backing of the TPSA conservative leader, Candace Turner. He once tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU SO YOU HAVE TELLED THE POPULAR TALK."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “acting according to his nature, and that’s really cool.”
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or costumes, or supporting his 'art') because I believe that person is pursuing and propagating ideology that is not good for my community.
He has the right to freedom.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He wasn’t the first artist to change his name, but instead followed Diddy’s path, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; or the late music legend Prince, also changed his name to an icon and later, changed it to another artist named Prince.
Man accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbed
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in court at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
An angry Game of Thrones movie star criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for playing the swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is furious with the heroic character’s archetype and mentions that such on-screen male characters will make young men feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong here” and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit has recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie. He admits he feels "quite necessary" to address the issue.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we did wrong with so-called masculinity?”
“What do we teach men as adults about the problems that are before us?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing malicious masculinity of the highly masculine characters they build.
He continued: “What are the innate characteristics and what are the characteristics of education?
What is being taught on TV and in the street that makes boys feel like they have to be male stereotypes?
I think this is really a dilemma of our time — how do we change?
Because obviously there was something unreasonable with our young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be participating in any more prequel or spinoff episodes of Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, saying he is “bored with the battlefield and the horses.”
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West remake that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing about him when he decided to stop playing Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, which is where the beginning of my future family and my life from now on comes in,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow's character that Kit plays in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the premises of Leslie's family residence in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids has increased by 14%.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of new cases recorded was 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a big change from the past.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV following this path has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 annually.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem that is happening in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been considered unlawful in China since 1997, in fact, discriminatory behavior towards the LGBT community remains very common.
Due to the country’s conservative traditional values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men eventually get married, despite having sex with men.
Many people are infected with the disease of the century by not using adequate protections during same-sex sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV treatment to all infected patients to cope with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked Republican senators’ data, stressing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia about lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles insist the complaints were settled by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and lies are even more despicable,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, the leaks included the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The reports began appearing online on Thursday by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The news came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifies the source of the posts related to Waters’s office and reveals information about one of Waters’ employees.
Waters went on to say, “This baseless allegation is completely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
“Employees in my office have been compromised in their identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these false and misleading allegations, which cannot be disclosed.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely untrue and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement immediately drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This refutation statement expresses anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she has no temperament to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that wasn’t their doing, they shouldn’t get angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not questioned about the motives of the person making the allegations.
They have to show calmness and calmness.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's response to Democratic criticism and critics also accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Waters claimed that her office had warned “the authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false allegations.”
“We will make sure the perpetrators are brought to light,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all actions that could be harmful and dangerous to any of my employees.”
Johnny English's Return to Rowan Atkinson's Funny, Useless Spy
Now, a fairly traditional trend in any new British-element film is to look for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the Johnny English action-comedy spy series is no exception. The series premiered in 2003 as Johnny English and the second season as Johnny English – Re-release, premiered in 2011.
Does the act of mocking ourselves on the subject of how useless we are become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English’s limited abilities with his rounded eyes and flexible facial muscles are allowed to shuffle things up again – his name simply represents a comic book designed for non-English speaking areas.
Of course he was a covert agent, although he always oddly pretended to be in the style of Inspector Clouseau, mixing Mr Bean’s humor and something that contributed to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character’s archetype also relies on the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercial that has now sunk into oblivion and caused chaos upon waking up.
There are quite a few interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I liked the sight of Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing his medieval armor and propellers pounding on his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully expressed, the humor element here seems to be insufficient and a little redundant, especially as "serious" franchises like the 007 series and Mission Impossible have made comedy just a spice.
The humorous element in this movie can only make children laugh, myself assuming that Johnny English’s blunders are nothing as creative and noticeable as the jokes in Atkinson’s silent film Mr. Bean.
The main problem is that England is in serious trouble.
Hackers have infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British spies operating outside, leading to the dismay of a mission agent, a very unfortunate minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
This was the prime minister’s last chance choice, a proud and powerful figure, now facing this far-right political crisis: Emma Thompson had a very good portrayal of Prime Minister Teresa May, but according to the script she didn’t have much acting.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identity of all active spies had been exposed and she would have to mobilize a retired agent.
And it’s Johnny English, a clumsy man who teaches in the countryside, but in fact teaches lessons outside of the program to be a secret agent: there are some funny jokes, because English teaches students to be a rock academy-style spy.
English is summoned back to Whitehall Court for an emergency meeting and reunites with former aide Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, hitchhiking a charming, luxurious female submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes the role of this talented little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin duo trouble with the Queen's Order return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in peril under the seductive tech billionaire's curse after claiming he can solve all of Britain's computer headaches: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an adventure with an unimaginable antics: after disguised as waiters, they burn a French restaurant in the blink of an eye; cause chaos on Volta's luxurious yacht; and English is even more messy when trying to use Virtual Reality headsets to probe Volta's home.
At the end of the movie, the knots will undoubtedly be removed, but such excitement is pretty much like children’s TV channels.
It's a pretty ordinary work.
And like all the other Johnny English movies, I can’t help but ask the question: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of his talent?
Labour rejects reports it is developing a plan to allow Britons to work four days but receive a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will allow British people to work four days a week but receive a five-day paycheck.
According to the information received, the party wants business owners to transfer their savings from the AI revolution to workers by giving them one more day off.
This means that employees will be able to take a three-day weekend off but still receive the same salary as before.
Sources said the idea was "in line" with the party's economic agenda and was expected to increase support for the country's workers.
The trade unions congress has confirmed the move to work four days a week as a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior source within the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “The review process for the policies is expected to be announced later this year.
“This goal cannot be achieved in the short term, but working four days a week is an aspiration in line with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse the idea. Britain’s Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not yet been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The policy of working four days a week is not the party’s policy and the party is not currently considering it.”
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to bolster his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the “unknown directors” and “benefactors” at utility companies.
The shadow prime minister’s plans also mean that existing shareholders in water supply companies may not get their full shares back because the Labour government may impose ‘deductibles’ based on behavior deemed wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company’s board and set up a Comprehensive Ownership Fund to give 10% of the share capital of private companies to employees, from which they could potentially receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's findings on Kavanaugh led them to change their mind.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to nominate him to the position of Supreme Court Justice for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Federal Intelligence Agency’s findings could prompt any Republican senator to withdraw support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, “60 Minutes” reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found any evidence that could make the senators change their mind.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Mr. Kennedy said.
“I said during the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, that is, after the charge was made and asked, 'Did you do it?'
He answered very decisively, decisively and decisively.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to have been absolutely certain.
“I’ve made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and only a powerful accusation will change me.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she names can’t verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to poverty alleviation?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast to carry out an equally impressive mission: ending world poverty.
In the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn Not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Hunger Reduction Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive free admission to the event (unless you are willing to pay for VIP tickets), concert attendees must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or any other meaningful form of awareness of poverty alleviation.
But how has this Global Citizens Festival been successful, when there are now only 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding tickets to a free music night for everyone a practical way to persuade people to call for action, or just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel they’re making a real difference by signing a petition online or submitting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens says there have been more than 10 million “actions” from supporters documented, advancing a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped motivate leaders around the world to make the equivalent of more than $37 billion in commitments and policies designed to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion disbursed or fundraised.
The group estimates that to date, secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers that pledges to “help children do their best,” promising to provide Rwanda $25 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from Global Citizens.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can turn the social injustice that led to malnutrition into a marker in history,” Nutrition Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project called Nutrition Power, which guarantees nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the FAQs on the group’s website, “What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizens group responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just like previous civil rights movements and anti-racism movements, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to blockade Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
The Washington Examiner quoted Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilize the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleges that Russia’s involvement in Syria — more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government — is just an excuse to explore the new energy market.
According to the report, he said: “I believe that the reason they are entering the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy like in Eastern Europe, the southern lowlands of Europe.”
And according to the official news, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to use the Navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and will close, when necessary, to ensure that their energy resources are not brought into the market,” he said.
Zinke has called on attendees to the event hosted by the Energy Alliance of Consumers, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two are equally effective.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and change fuels,” he said, calling Russia “the only one strong” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels alone.
The statements come as the Trump administration seeks to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, aiming to replace Russia’s position, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project that, according to Trump, has left Moscow in “full control” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, built to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s stiff opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers must be selected as suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy, as well as the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider” running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
The Hill newspaper quoted her as saying: “It is time for women to come to Washington and correct the government’s mistakes, and so need a woman at the forefront.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a meeting at the town hall, saying he was “moving the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course the FBI has to investigate before voting."
But a poll on Thursday showed a majority of Warren’s voters didn’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters "probably" think senators should not run.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of her election.
The poll found that more voters supported former Governor Deval Patrick’s bid, with 38 percent voting in favor and 48 percent opposed.
Other potential Democratic candidates named in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin Citing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) of Track Palin at Donald Trump Campaign
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he returns, I can fully think of other families who have also suffered the consequences of PTSD and the trauma our soldiers carry when they return,” she told a crowd at the Donald Trump campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a clear issue that no one wants to talk about" and said her son and the other veterans who returned from the war "were more transformed, more thorny, and wondered if there was any respect for them and their comrades, airmen and every other member of the military for what they had done for this country."
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
Eighteen states and D.C. support new asylum policy challenges
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing challenging the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text on Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers opposing the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August to protest federal policy remains undisclosed.
She said her lover "and the sons of his violent gang members" abused her but US officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of Grace-backed states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum applicants in the U.S. are as countries facing issues of gangs and domestic violence that are fairly common.
The new U.S. refugee policy goes against a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignores state, federal and international legal systems that have been around for decades.”
“Federal law requires reviewing all asylum applications based on the specific facts and circumstances of the requester and this obstruction policy violates that principle,” the document states.
Prosecutors also argued in the short text that immigration denial policies hurt the U.S. economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide adequate resources of necessary labor.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked judges to process immigration applications not to continue granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse in June.
“Only allow asylum to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political viewpoint,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy announcement.
Refugee asylum is never a measure of mitigating all the problems — even all the serious ones — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more catastrophic.
“It’s really stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
People return to their destroyed homes, picking up furniture submerged in water, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, after damage from the magnitude 7.5 quake.
Several people were injured, including Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulders were fractured outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patient was treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he recalled the sensation of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and crying for help, but I didn’t hear anything.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they are all safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily covering the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned an additional amount of China Daily money to Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling state newspaper – after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s increased pressure campaign against China, according to U.S. officials.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in an escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on imports from both sides.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariffs in retaliation in the early stages of the trade war have been designed to target exporters in Republican-backed states like Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of the state of Iowa, which exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is “continuing that bullying behavior by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In its propaganda effort, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the U.S. tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you rarely find dissenting views and will not see any honest reflection of the Chinese people’s differing opinions on China’s difficult economic trajectory, because it is clear that the media is entirely under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers shunned the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of Kavanaugh’s midterm elections
As many of the top Republicans defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination against several sexual assault allegations, analysts warned they could face backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the incident are strong and most of the Republican candidates on the list have indicated they want to keep voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had pushed the button to allow the FBI to conduct enough investigations to appease angry voters.
Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget until November.”
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched through the Senate corridors as Republicans took control of the Judiciary Committee that chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Enthusiasm and momentum for democracy will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“They say that momentum is very high now; yes.
But it could be even higher, especially among female suburban voters and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford was publicly sworn in on details of the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said the public would likely have a backlash if Republicans continued the confirmation.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as saying last week: “This could become a mess that Republicans have to deal with.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh will become a Supreme Court judge, but more importantly, how Republicans handle the House and how they treat the accusers,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, the Democratic Party’s support group, told the news channel.
But Americans have disagreed on whether to trust Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony, and it seems more suspicious of Kavanaugh’s.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents confirmed or could trust Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or could trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents thought that Kavanaugh may or may have lied when giving testimony, while only 30% thought that Ford was certain or may have lied.
After Flake pressed the consent button, the FBI is conducting an investigation into Ford’s allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court Justice candidate of exposing his genitals to her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start building new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology’s latest project is called Inrupt, a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and what permissions people are given to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to start now,” he said of the start-up project.
“Now is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
This data warehouse may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, they’re all available on one browser and display simultaneously.
What’s unique about this online store of personal data is that users have full authority to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “entrusting control over data to individuals.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company has the right resources, processes, and skills to help deliver Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was acquired by IBM, several developers who have contracted to work under the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether or not the change is going to happen completely because all of their business models can be upgraded overnight.
“We don’t need their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the debate over the neutrality of the internet.
Despite the launch of the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann received the Victorian Cross during World War I.
The 100th anniversary of the only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded Queen Victoria's Cross during World War I as a warrior was held in his hometown.
Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died as a result of sniper shooting four days later, and he himself was never known to have won the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two of his nephews unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said it was a “brilliant symbol” when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann commanded his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then rushed straight into the gunfire and with "great courage" led the battalion to the top, before plunging into one rifleman and knocking down three commandos.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “an action I could never have done myself, but there was humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after the Royal Brentwood Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "incredibly honored to join the parade" and that "the courage of a true hero will be credited to the support of so many people."
Martial arts fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they end up just getting Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night waiting to see Bellator 206 with its crowded stands, but ended up being refused to watch the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 battles, including six on the main card and live-streamed throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the game, British viewers were stunned as the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they wake up near the morning to watch the game.
One fan expressed on Twitter that turning the show into a children's cartoon was like "an ungrateful joke."
“The government stipulates that martial arts content shown at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to transform it into a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa the pig," he said.
The president of Bellator Company, Scott Coker, said that they are considering a broadcast schedule to ensure a British audience can watch the show in the future.
Mr Coker said: "I think if we play it back, we can solve the problem."
“But it was 6am on Sunday and we couldn’t handle it until Sunday in our time zone, but Monday in their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people switched programs, there were a lot of messages going back and forth and those messages weren't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, which we initially thought was due to a technical malfunction.
But in the end, it’s not because of government regulations.
I can promise you this won't happen the next time.
We will be reducing the number of matches to five, instead of the six originally planned – five is the number of matches we usually offer and we have tried to offer in excess to the fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Poorly Lost’ About Sexual Orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley said that as he grew up, he always felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation – but that was his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize he was “like no one” until he was in school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay men’s rights to bring “hope” to others.
He also said being a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to recover.
In the first issue led by Laverne, Daley appears as an "abandoned" person, stating that he feels "poorly lost" to everyone, because "his gender is not socially acceptable as clearly boys and girls."
“To this day, the feeling of being inferior and different still exists, becoming the motivation and strength for me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he had “something accomplished” so that people would not be disappointed to learn the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active campaigner for the LGBT community and he used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to fight discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without discrimination and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion shared that he was in love with American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "unexpectedly fell in love."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference has never been a hindrance between the two.
“When you have to go through so much suffering as a child” – he first participated in the Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – it will be difficult to find someone of that age who has experienced ups and downs in his life.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "worldview" had changed.
“If you asked last year, my goal was ‘I have to win the gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘I can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he took his last breath and even when he stopped breathing and went away forever, I finally couldn’t admit that he had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just know that it’s been a dream of my whole life — jumping in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympic Games, there’s really no feeling better than that,” he said.
This was also the inspiration for him to choose his first song – Heather Small’s “Proud” – which accompanied him in his training towards the Olympic Games and still moved him every time he heard it again.

Mickelson lacking form on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his form to avoid the record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson has played in the bi-annual event 12 times but captain Jim Furyk left him on the bench in Saturday's fourball and foursome series.
Instead of being the centerpiece of action as in America, the five-time winner spends the day cheerleading and playing games in hopes of escaping the discomfort.
The 48-year-old whose knacks are flat shots has never been the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, even when he is at the peak of his form, because the wrong shots here will suffer heavy consequences.
And if the golf course isn't enough obsessive, Mickelson will have to play in Sunday's 9th match against British Open Champion Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches.
If the U.S. team, currently four points behind the start of the 12-match series, wants to start impressively, then Mickelson’s game is paramount.
Furyk expressed confidence in his players and did not say too much.
"He understands his role very well today, he pats me on the back, he puts his arms around me and says he will be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I could never have imagined that he played two games.
I envisioned more, but that’s the way things are and we think it’s the right way.
He wants to play, like all his teammates.”
This Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most-played player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because the peaks in his personal record have never appeared in this Tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and a draw, although Furyk argues his presence brings intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people. Having him in the group is really fun," he explains.
“I think the young golfers are happy to see him and this week was quite fun.
What he gave was more than what he fought for.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, has the experience that even though his team has a lot of lead in the last Ryder Cup singles matches, the results can be easily reversed in an unpleasant way.
The Dane began playing in 1997 at Valderrama, where their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, was five points ahead of the United States but ended up winning only close to 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always have to remind yourself that we have a lot of lead in Valderrama; we have a lot of lead in Brookline and we lost, in Valderrama, we won, but we struggled,” Bjorn said, with a face that he envisioned after watching the Class of 2018 game with a 5-3 win on Friday and a 10-6 lead yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
You still have to be mentally focused tomorrow.
Going on the field and playing well.
The tournament is not over until the score is on the table.
“We have a goal to win the trophy this year and that’s our focus.
I always say I’m focused on my 12 players, but we also understand the strength of your team – they’re the best players in the world.”
Excited about his players' performances on the bumpy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never say anything in advance.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is an individual show and it will be different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes smoothly. But when you play individually, all the abilities of a player are revealed.
That’s the message that you have to share with every player, that they have to be ready to play their best tomorrow.
Now a pair must be separated and each one must be ready to play the best.”
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent's captain, Jim Furyk, expected his golfers to show better individual abilities than when playing in pairs, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas had three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both directions in major turning points on his last day, having been a member of the winning team at Brookline before his defeat while the European team was hailed as "The Miracle at Medinah."
“I remember every word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, had gathered and encouraged the players before the last day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’ll want to start as quickly as you see at Brookline, or as you see at Medinah.
When the results are following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We build the squad that way and send players on the pitch strategically and try to do the miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the team to compete and face Rory McIlroy in the top-flight match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European golfers in the first series.
“I chose this group, in that order because I believe that’s the way to get over it,” Bjorn said of his choice for the singles match.
Germany's new warship has been delayed from entering service.
The German Navy’s newest destroyer was supposed to have been tested in 2014 to replace a Cold War-era warship, but it will not be able to be tested until at least next year due to system failures and rising costs.
A military spokesman told Die Zeit: “Rheinland-Pfalz,” the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg destroyer, has been delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery troubles hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class destroyer.
This means that the ships will be armed with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic reduction.
Other important features include longer maintenance times – being able to deploy the latest destroyers far from national ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delay means that these modern warships – which are supposed to give Germany control of foreign countries – will become obsolete at the start of their use, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky destroyer F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to test-ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media referred to "serious software and hardware flaws", which resulted in the warship being completely useless for combat missions.
The software flaw was particularly severe because the Baden-Wuerttemberg would be run by a fleet of 120 sailors – only half the manpower on the old Bremen-class destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the ship's weight increased significantly, leading to reduced performance and limited future Navy upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the same warship used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including training the crew – is also a serious problem.
The project is said to have teamed up substantial capital to a figure of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the estimated initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of the latest deployment of destroyers has become particularly important, given the recent warnings of a shrinking German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the navy was “really lacking in warships capable of combat.”
The official said the problem was getting worse over time, because the old ship was decommissioned but there were no replacements.
He complained that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted at a site in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
Hopefully these findings will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracked the journey of common bats, soprano pipistrelles, brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens area in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the research site to monitor the activity of these bat species throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The audio analyst will analyze all the recordings and determine the bat’s sound frequency and the purpose of the sound of each particular genus.
A map and report of the bats’ habitat will then be made to give a detailed picture of the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will help determine which areas are most important to bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management practices of organisms, such as grassland cultivation, and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting bat rigs and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose a risk to bats.
Bats are not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when stalking and catching prey.
They use an extremely sophisticated echo positioning technique to identify obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, while taking bats with special importance.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly carry out surveys, tests and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Managing the land, David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great habitat for bats,” he said.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of trees and a good environment.
But there’s still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and at other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow further.”
He stressed the importance of checking the life of bats before conserving them in the grounds, because accidental destruction of their breeding rigs can kill up to 400 females and vomiters, almost completely destroying the population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their rigs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a staff member of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the community to join in helping.
“We still need to learn more about bats, and for many species, we can’t tell how far their populations are from each other.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyer prepares to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the sexual allegations against him were “fake news” and that someone “wanted to take advantage” of his name.
His lawyer is set to sue the German daily Der Spiegel for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese forward who currently plays for Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in her Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday: The player reportedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
In a video streamed live on Instagram before 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed the report was "fake news".
"No, no, no.
What they said today was fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or player said in front of the camera.
“They want to take advantage of my name.
That's just normal.
Saying my name is famous, but that’s just part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” added the player, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called “an unacceptable suspicion of private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in amounts corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a luxury accommodation at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room. According to records filed in Clark County Courthouse, Nevada, he allegedly raped her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99%" a "good person", only "1%" was not good.
There are documents suggesting that Ronaldo confirmed the two sides had arising from sexual relations, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was photographed with her wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to mediate out of court because she was “fear of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reverse her previous conciliation decision as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the allegations, Ronaldo was preparing a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer he moved to play for Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing its status as carmaker
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK “will forever regret” if it loses its post-Brexit world leadership in car manufacturing.
Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, it will stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 units last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the European Union completely by the end of March, we will have to stop production at this plant," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is the supply chain risk in the event of a Brexit without another deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “just-in-time” principle, with parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for order-made vehicles.
If Britain leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there could be a potential border interruption and the sector fears could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
Toyota said it could not keep inventory value for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union would be "precisely adjusted to avoid border checks."
"We need to make a deal. We want to make the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we seize this opportunity very well," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers shows that we need to ensure continued successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not announced for how long it will stop production, but in the long run, it warns that further costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a unite unionist at the factory, said his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience of losing these jobs, there's never been one again.
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and credible plan for future relations with the European Union.”
White House says meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday: President Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “go back another week” as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination continues.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating the meddling in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aides and Russia and the possibility of the president obstructing the enforcement of justice.
Trump’s firing of the deputy attorney general, and the inability of Mueller to operate independently, have stirred up rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein declined to report.
But last Monday, he arrived at the White House amid speculation he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump, who was visiting the U.N. General Assembly in New York at the time, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse who testified.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while further delaying the full Senate vote.
President Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The meeting date has not been set, possibly this week, it can be seen that the reason for this postponement is because of other issues going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll get the news soon and the press will be up to date.”
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders said the lack of press briefings was not due to dislike of TV reporters for "too much talk", though she had previously said: "I also agree that reporters are in fact a lot of talk."
She then suggested further direct contact between President Trump and the press.
“The president is currently conducting more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” she added, without giving evidence: “We’ve looked at the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences, but "if the press had a chance to ask the president directly, it would be much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried a lot and you’ve also seen a lot of work in the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump frequently answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at press conferences when visiting officials.
Simple press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president should have announced the reason but he suddenly appeared in a strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
The health minister writes to European Union staff working in the health sector in Scotland to talk about his fear of Brexit
The health minister wrote to staff of the European Union working in the health industry in Scotland to express the nation’s gratitude and the desire for staff to remain in post-Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that she would resign within six months of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to supporting the costs of applications to certify the status of residence of citizens of the European Union who are working in the transferred public service sector.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Throughout this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union continue, and a decision is expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a scenario where a deal could not be reached.
I know that this is an unsettled time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Moreover, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while also benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we look forward to your stay.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee Tigers side Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee-based Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He ran towards the sidelines and collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen right at the vertical border before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the extent/type of the injury" and that Tennessee was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in the red shirt team, first played under the Tennessee shirt after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being knocked out of the game and he had a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes, which will be used to help the homeless under Tory’s new policies.
This change will nullify Corbyn’s attempts to attract young voters
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects the policy to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year – to help the homeless.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged higher taxes – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
The change will effectively nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with a commitment to provide cheaper housing and target high-income people.
The tax increase will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to combat the current state of stagnation.
Surcharges — in addition to the current tax rates, which include higher taxes announced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased just there — can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this change to help raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of newly built properties in London have been sold to non-British nationals, which has pushed home prices up and made it increasingly difficult for first-time homebuyers.
Many of the country’s affluent areas — especially in the capital — have become “ghost towns” as the majority of foreigners who buy homes spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give more young people the chance to own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, urging Prime Minister May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to remedy the "home problem" in Britain.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rents and ending "no fault" deportations.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
“Last year I said that I would spend my term in office restoring the British dream – that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means having to regulate the currently turbulent housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this doesn’t mean that people who don’t live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy homes like hardworking British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "final ambition" was to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of resurrecting the Northeastern club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points behind first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with a B logo and that’s exactly what I wanted,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“My childhood years were tied to those Scottish fights in Hampden with my father, and that’s always something I remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors to Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach said he felt no pressure to be his successor after such a big name at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be judged by 'can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'
The organizational structure and facilities at this club certainly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not a task to achieve easily, but I only consider myself a success if I can bring the club back to the league.”
Ross spent only three years as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from his relegation to third place, and brought St Mirren from relegation to championship next season.
Ross said he is now comfortable throughout his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he recalls in his role as Alloa’s lead.
“I really believe that I am more suited to a managerial role than a player.
This may sound strange because I was quite successful, had a good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of work but I am satisfied with the management job.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself in my adult life.”

Surveys show that the ideal time to enjoy a beer is 5.30pm on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted sales for struggling pubs in the UK but added pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw revenue increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting firm, who compiled the figures, said: “The prolonged sun and England’s entry into the World Cup made the July sales trend similar to that of June, when pubs rose 2.8% and restaurants were hit harder.
Sales at restaurants fell 1.8 percent in June and worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that specialize in beverages have the fastest growth when compared to drops at restaurants.
Pubs that specialize in food are also affected by the heat, though not as severe as restaurants.
Seems like everyone just wants to have a drink.
Drink sales at managed pubs and bars increased 6.6 percent for the month while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM hotel and entertainment industry analyst, said: “These results reflect the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to revenue at restaurants.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, with revenues falling 4.8 percent year-on-year while cost pressures continue to rise.
The prolonged hot summer was at its worst for food vendors, not knowing if in August cooler weather would improve the current situation.”
Total revenue growth at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand rollout.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collected and analyzed data on work performance from 47 active teams, with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that’s the benchmark of the industry.
One in Five Kids Has Secret Social Media Accounts That Their Parents Don’t Know About
One in five children — some aged 11 — have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don’t know about, the survey found.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that the number of “virtual Insta” sites has increased significantly.
The news has raised concerns about the rise of online pornography.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “primary” account to show their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in fake Insta accounts — a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has added to concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they used a “principal” account with no bad content to show their parents, while also having their own account.
A mother accidentally finds the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and sees one teenager urging someone else to “rape me.”
According to research by the UK Digital Awareness Society and the Seminar for Principals (HMC) at private schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "representative of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletics council as the non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most medal-winning athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie sees this change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich experience in international competitions over the past decade.
“Eilidh is very respected in the Scottish athletics community, the UK and around the world, we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by electing her to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead this sport in Scotland."
An American, who had won the 200 metres and 400 metres gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, had all four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC permanent commentator, was unable to walk after experiencing a mild stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
Doctors say only time will tell if I will recover or be in any condition.
It was a tiring journey, but to recover completely, I learned how to walk again and now I can walk fast!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Dairy pump advertising compares mothers to dairy cows divisive online
A company that specializes in pumping milk has divided online opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product considered "the world's first wearable and noise-free suction machine", consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad inspired by the satirical music video to show the freedom that the new suction machine gives mothers.
Four mothers danced in a cowshed full of hay on a song that had the lyrics: "Yes, I milked my own, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, this isn't a udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Suck out the milk, suck it out, I’m feeding the kids, suck it out, I’m milking my girls.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked much controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say the ad disregards the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to babies to produce milk, except for calves that are stolen from their mothers within a few days of giving birth.

Another commented: “This can be psychologically damaging to both the mother and the baby.
That’s right, why not use it to advertise pumps for breastfeeding mothers?”
Another commenter added: “This ad has nothing to do with it.”
There were people who also defended the ad, a woman who admitted that she found the song "very funny".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy myself one if I still breastfeed my baby.
The milking really made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a bit crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: "This is an interesting ad that targets mothers who need to pump milk (often at work or in the toilet) and they feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement praising or evaluating the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group revealed that they were dancing with the pump hidden in their undershirts.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who milk to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump does not make any noise, has no wires or tubes and sits quietly inside the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, carry the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is truly a revolutionary product that deserves a bold showcase and encourages curiosity.
When comparing women to dairy cows, we want people to be aware of the suction products and the challenges associated with them, while expressing in a fun and empathic way the freedom that new suction products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie pump has appeared in newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on designer Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has spiked even though the number of people crossing the border monthly has remained virtually unchanged, partly because the harsh arguments and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made the process of bringing children to donors even more difficult.
Traditionally, most donors have been undocumented immigrants, and they fear that accepting an immigrant child could affect their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to take their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for funding for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had never had a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members are here illegally, and the vast majority of them have criminal records.
So, we are continuing to prosecute these individuals,” Albence said.
According to staff working in refugee camps, in order to quickly handle cases involving the children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to previous standards.
Many will appear through video conferencing calls, rather than being in person, to make a defense of their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed to be ineligible for sponsorship will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent acts or attempts to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters say concern is growing at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a struggling child more likely to be ignored due to the size of the camp being too large.
They added that bringing children to cities with refugee camps without giving them enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends can be psychologically traumatic.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to immediately withdraw from the country
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their home countries, despite the civil war entering its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the guise of counter-terrorism forces, so "will be dealt with".
“They must leave Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he told the council.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terror in Syria is nearing its end” and that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting in this jihad until we purge terrorist groups from the entire territory of Syria" and the "illegal presence of foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and advising both Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the country's conditions were good enough for them to return to, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fear" that prevented refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to create conditions for the return of refugees,” he said.
“They are using political cards on humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a neutral zone in Idlib’s last rebel zone has created an opportunity to spur political negotiations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists including militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which includes the government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the committee's work was limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warning against meddling in elections.
Why Trump will win a second term
Logically, President Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandals bring an end to the presidency ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is obviously "the most dramatic episode of a presidency!"
So far there are no signs of cooling down.
Since 2014, Golden Hour viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at prime time, compared to 1.7 million from four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable TV charts with more than 3.5 million viewers viewing the main news spots.
“Although they don’t understand it, many people are drawn to it like scorched bodies,” said Neal Baer, who runs ABC’s “Designated Survivor” television show, about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: and Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
"He said, 'Because he's making me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
This is interesting in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any move by Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or the reunification of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only some television viewers have the privilege of selecting their own channels.
Not only that, but it’s more appealing than the news when you spend six hours watching a group of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward’s “in-depth” source of information in Paul Manafort’s book “Fear,” or his $15,000 ostrich-feather bomber coat (“a showy outfit,” writes the Washington Post) and the implications of Trump’s excessive dissections.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when it comes to the cast and surprises on Trump’s daily TV show (such as beating up the N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t keep up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the house on the north bank of Kauai under the 80-degree heat, but he hid inside the house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He could not leave the screen, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scale.
"I remember the days when we were doing those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from the outside poured into the most intense midterm elections for the White House race.
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is witnessing a rain of cash, as the rearrangement of the congressional district has prompted two incumbents to run for the same seat.
The recent geopolitical rearrangement in Pittsburg County knocked out Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another county in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican nominee Keith Rothfus, who now represents the former 12th District in Pennsylvania, which shares multiple frontiers with the new 17th District.
The cadastral map was re-planned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former counties were rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has become a financial race between the party's main donor institutions, the Democratic Committee on Congressional Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was already a household name in Pennsylvania after a close-knit victory in the much-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th District of Congress.
It had previously belonged to the Republican Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators have rated Democrats higher.
The U.S. considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China, but later withdrew it.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing and Washington with little to no objections.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and the president used to own a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. chiefs of missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties are only weighed against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions for a number of subjects, would be hugely damaging to the Central American nation that now has high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings are underway, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic issues to reorganize a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue the conference, which would help end penal considerations for U.S. El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, when there is a signal to take administrative measures.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no tough message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information was corroborated by an outside analyst with close ties to the authorities and also spoke anonymously.
History of Research
The next bomb could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence in public filings.
It is thought that Mueller is turning his investigation into the issue of collusion between President Trump and Russia during the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in Congress, Trump will have a hard time in Congress, just before the election campaign, and even with people from his own party.
There are a lot of issues, and I don’t mean that President Trump’s departure is inevitable — just like his counterparts in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices that will affect the length of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed to oppose and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage.
History revolves around such landmarks, and the Democratic Party’s uncompromising struggles will either increase or delay.
Americans face some of these milestones.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in flames since there were reports last year about him proposing secretly recording presidential eavesdropping and speculation about the president’s inappropriate office.
Rosenstein argues that the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair – or if he confirms to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Above all, will we vote midterm for a Congress so that it will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I had a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

The optimism of Graham Dorrans of the Ranger team ahead of the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers played Rapid Vienna on Thursday, learning that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the advantage to qualify for the group G stage of the Europa League trophy.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more amazing things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal are a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We were in the game with the belief that we would win a point.
We could have won at the end of the game but the draw was not a bad result.
They probably played better in the first half but we counterattacked in the second half and were in better form.
Thursday will be an important match in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the previous game, but with the support of the fans, I am sure we can get through and get a good result.
“Last year was a difficult period, I had injuries and changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
The team is good, the players are in good form with good training quality.
“Hopefully we can go further and reap a successful new season.”
Women are worried to the point of losing sleep because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear understanding of what they were interested in, few spoke to family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to look after them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t mentally prepare the family for them to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes first.
Talk to your counselor and your family to discuss where and how care is taken, as those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care purposes may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-worth life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or purchase insurance with your own money – as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents carefully: Avoid possible legal battles.
There is a health care plan available so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee the medical care process and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you can’t afford it.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Make a list of those details so you’re always ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about doctors?" asked Martin.
“What medications are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you made a plan?”
Man shot multiple times with rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a rifle on his way home during the night.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and arms.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "spontaneous act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police called witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.
Communications were cut off, and aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a fjord on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a capital spanning more than 300 km (180 mi) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The capital, an administrative region under the provincial administration, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the two major sectors of the economy in Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important industry, but is mainly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the capital Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
The quake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and opposing an arrest warrant, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the invoking crime, he grabbed his phone.
Palin is being held in custody in Mat-Su and has to pay a $500 non-guaranteed bail, according to KTUU’s report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly not guilty" when asked to defend himself, according to the report.
Palin faces three A-class counts, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with Class B minor charges, was jailed for one day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unconscious state related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in the quake that struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications network has been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are being posted on social media showing the timing of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors are recommending the death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are recommending the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment not yet carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on Oct. 10.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the announcement of the proposed death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these crimes are punishable by death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of deliberate murder including eight counts of homicide, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "meticulous planning and advances", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "brutal, cruel and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian," the court said in a statement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York carried out the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also ordered the ISIS flag to be hung in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal defense lawyers, said they were “absolutely disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We think that the decision to implement the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the vulnerability of this event to those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to issue the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to "make the populace" during a rally at a conservative party convention.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European skeptics - as one of Prime Minister Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out of the coalition” right now if Farage were Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces as she tries to reconcile the deep divide between conservative MPs, who favor staying in the European Union, has joined a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to stick to a compromise plan between attacks by Brexit supporters, those who support staying and the European Union.
The allies insisted she would push by trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash – and forcing European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her plans and the “current turmoil.”
Bone said during the “Leave Means” rally in Solihull that he wanted to “oppose the Chequers plan”.
He suggested Farage should remain in the senate and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would be out of the coalition now,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we need to oppose Chequers.”
He echoed his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in world wars to be submissive to others.
We want to build our own law.”
Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the coalition is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people approve of the Chequers plan, the opposition won’t vote for it, which usually doesn’t happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us from the start.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their seats as they keep their promises to the people.”
Farage said politicians must join the protests to "feel the heat" if they change their mind in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want to let the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, feel the heat of the situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who brought Brexit victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters who stayed marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists held up Conservative Party banners against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they were facing at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who have told us that they can control the IT system and all the technology provided to Canada, including free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is totally a joke.
Brexit is not a good thing," he added.
Warren is determined to run for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be determined to "run the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future when she addressed the town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, in a race against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculate that she could take over Trump’s position in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since President Trump took office.
An attendee asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to get involved in politics to reform the government and to have a woman at the head.”
Arrested in LSU player Sims shot dead
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET TV news.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and has died," Sheriff Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a weapon, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A teenager with a height of 1.98m and raised in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 in the official squad last season with an average playing time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team at the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and consecutively overtook Hamilton to defend his position in the first two laps and caused Vettel to fight his own teammates.
Vettel entered the first pit and abandoned Hamilton when he re-entered the track, a decisive move.
The Mercedes entered the pit behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead as the Ferrari driver was forced to slow down to avoid risk after two legs to defend the third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and came in seventh place at the end of the first leg right on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead throughout the race without changing tyres to reach the finish line quickly and overtook Kimi Raikkonen to take fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to accelerate in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It was a tough race because Valtteri did very well over the weekend and he was a really good driver.
Eventually the team had an excellent race to win the No. 1 and No. 2 titles," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s campaign because she insisted she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the Supreme Court’s allegations of sexual assault in the Brett Kavanaugh case.
Speaking during the campaign on the West Coast of Virginia, the president did not directly target the announcement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed people were “bad and dishonest.”
“Something has happened and what’s going on in these days in the Senate is amazing, you can feel the anger, you can see the angry, the ugly and the upset and the dishonest,” he said.
“When they look at the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one doing that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, didn't you?
Remember her answer... you leaked the documents... "Wow, what's going on?
No, no, no.
I'm not leaking."
Come on, let's wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t do that,” the president parodied the senator’s words.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office leaked the information.
“I’m not concealing Dr. Ford’s allegations, I’m not leaking her story,” Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked.”
But the president appeared dissatisfied with her refusal behavior and he commented during the campaign Saturday night: “I’ll tell you about that, it’s really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president argued that Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You’ll see the meaning and the discomfort because they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, they want power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 over Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars offset Friday’s Belfast Giants loss in the Elite League by a 5-3 win in the second leg at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two early goals thanks to a scoring by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the home team before Dwyer added points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard went on to equalize for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the final.
It was the team's third Elite League defeat of the season led by Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in a match played in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants have won in the previous three games.
Dwy's opening goal in the fourth minute when the clock was 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the goal in the gap just four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the home team shorten the score at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became the player who helped Cownie equalize the score at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when he scored the second goal at the end of the half.
The hosts were consulted and Bouchard again levelled the score with a spectacular goal at the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead at the end of the second half and he scored his fifth goal for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants, which have lost four of their last five games, are now taking a break to wait for the next game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of passengers on board from earthquake
Indonesian air traffic controllers are being hailed as a hero after making sacrifices to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to wreak havoc in the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that the aircraft carrying Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
Then he died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision saved lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken upon receiving this news,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said, adding that it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have not yet reached many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves as high as six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries the bodies.
Clean water is rare.
“Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know what the situation is there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "I would like you all to work day and night to complete any evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says there is still a man missing after crashing a plane at sea
The flight operator that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia said a man was still missing, following earlier statements that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we had not been able to find a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more details about passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airlines said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all remained in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events have not yet been determined.
The US Air Force and Navy both said the plane landed at sea shortly after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was missing a runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through water to the waist to reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants were panicked and screaming, and he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the wharf also helped rescue them by using floats to pick up people onshore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
Data from the airline safety network shows that 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in the PNG network over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts say it was the night the girl was burned alive
The plaintiffs based the file on Saturday during a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use the mobile record to synthesize the movements of 21-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from a cell phone number that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous statement, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police officer who questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show they have only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that on occasion after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He removed her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense attorney is expected to begin closed-door discussions on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial of the jury that day.
High Breed: What Is Positive Hip Hop?
The trio of hip hop artists want to counter the negative view of the genre by introducing positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claims hip hop has ceased to convey political messages and address social issues.
The group wanted to bring the genre back to its true origins and re-popularize positive hip hop music.
Recently artists such as the Fugees Group and Common have gained more popularity in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple who fired her after text message 'racist'
A New York nanny has sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she missed a text message from her mother complaining that she was “a black person.”
The couple denied they were racists, describing the case as a “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed frustration when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day at the job in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
However, instead of sending a text message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman "disgusted" fired Maurice, who said that the African-born nanny who was about to quit was doing a bad job and that she hoped to have a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid a day’s pay and took her Uber home.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for a $350-a-day layoff over a six-month period for the job she was hired to receive the money despite not signing any contracts.
“I want to show them, look, you can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to the allegations that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment for fear that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t intend to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you’ve offended, even by mistake?
What about the newborn?
Let's talk."
When comparing the case to a “blackmail” case, Plasco said his wife had given birth two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case was going on, the public opinion rushed to point the finger at the couple on social media, denigrating their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington Press fears readers won’t care about the story of a talking bear, the letter says.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was widely accepted, said in the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes when the book was first published.
It’s amazing that we now know about Paddington’s huge success.”
When talking about his father, a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book from a small toy bear, he still feels optimistic when his work is rejected, she added in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication, which was a “mixed sadness” after his death last year.
When talking about Paddington, she described her as “a very important member of our family,” adding that her father was quietly proud of her success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not an aggressive one," she said.
“But since Paddington really existed for him, it’s almost like having a child and it’s been a success: you’re proud of them even when they don’t really exist.
I think you've seen Paddington's conduct that way.
Although it was a product of his creativity and imagination, he always gave Paddington a certain place.”
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye on the phone
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“I call Nad often to say that this is bad and she shouldn’t have to,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The doctors pumped her heart medication and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not finished.
I can’t cry or scream or cry because I’m with my family and everyone.
I have to be the one connecting them.”
Eventually Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, still grieved by her daughter’s passing, boarded the plane with other passengers—facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
"No one knows," she said.
“I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to explain, but on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Grieving Woman Posts Postcard to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop others from stealing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Davis’ son Tyler, then 13, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to be in the sense that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a cheerful laugh.
“Everyone knows it because of the laughter.
They used to say his laughter lights up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s eleven-year-old brother passed away just like his brother after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there would be a chain reaction.”
Ms. Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are always people you can meet, talk to, or even make friends with.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He wasn’t talking about feeling bored or frustrated or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed he changed his attitude.
He was bored at school on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents and he didn’t have an eye on them or anything around him.”
She said that her husband's death was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to overcome it: "This has caused a huge gap in our family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hovering as the FBI begins its investigation
Flake said on Saturday that "I think, if we can really get something like what you've asked for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation, we can get a little bit," adding that he fears that the committees will "get caught up" in partisan riots.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is only a matter of time.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, on Nov. 6 – if expected, Republicans in a very bad state will be even weaker in their efforts to find the representative they want to vote for in the top office.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying for Kavanaugh, who had been a White House aide under President Bush, to have access to his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released the reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote.
It was not immediately clear if Kavanaugh could get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, now vice president, to untie the knot and confirm his position on the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors ‘diminished’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has plummeted since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a lawmaker in South Korea said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and a large proportion of smugglers arrested were key factors of the shift.
He did not make any public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea have finally been granted Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea – technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves come after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where both sides agreed to extended terms to move toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for delays in the process.
“Without any trust on the U.S. side, there would be no trust on our national security and in that case, there would be no way we would unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "extremist" and said he was not fit for a Supreme Court position.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, an "extremist" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview that took place Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help it, but I think if a woman has ever done so then they would call it ‘extremist,’” Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a lot of emotion, at times almost shouting and choking when talking about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned Democrats in front of the committee, calling the charges against him a “carefully planned assassination” amid anger over Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was unfit for a position on the Supreme Court, as he clearly demonstrated his behavior against the Democratic Party.
“I think he dismissed himself for making his statements and his treatment when it came to the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only not on the Supreme Court, he’s also on the court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s ability to make a ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh evaded the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time for a radical, biased person in court and hopefully we’ll say, ‘Isn’t this wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to take advantage of it.
This was a really heavy criticism, month after month, year after year, the anger grew stronger, and she couldn’t get over it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, how about you?”
She continued, "I've been helped a lot by a woman, she's a senior director, she said she also cried when she was angry but to form a reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she'd just spoken with, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great."
You are allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of the escape to rage because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at my first company is that it was a male-only place, I used to cry when there was an outburst of anger, it was when I was pulled into the stairs by an older woman who was my cold manager.
She told me, "Never let them see you cry."
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’re with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and was left out of the race, Schroeder was extremely disappointed, arguing that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
Thirty years later she smiled and said to me, “It was not a wise decision.”
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and they needed another candidate.
Some have called this race "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to her late involvement in the campaign, she lost in the fundraising campaign, so she vowed that she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She discovered that some supporters gave her US$250 instead of US$1,000 in favor of the male candidate.
She asked herself, “Do they think I’m being discounted?”
When she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she overcame the emotion — expressing gratitude to those who supported her, frustrated with the system that made the fundraising process difficult, and targeting voters rather than delegates — that she was angry at being sexist — that she was angry at choking.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled how the press had reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my tombstone.
'Are you crying?'
U.S.-China trade war could be a good sign for Beijing
Experts say the beginnings of the trade war between the United States and China have stalled, and the war will continue, and the rift between the countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning by slapping tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The escalation has been increasing in recent weeks with tariffs worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) on half of Chinese goods imported into the United States.
Beijing has retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in proportion to the actions of the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be shaken soon.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make demands, but publicly succumbing to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can make the right moves, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can start an economic relationship in either country is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for the New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to let refugees return voluntarily and is calling for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the national situation is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions
All current conditions are available for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the nation would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States with a final score of 16.5–10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the championship when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14.5 points when it beat the US team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has participated in most tournaments, threw his shot into the water at the third shot at the 16th hole, admitting he lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of only four players to have won 5-0-0 since the current mod season began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played the last Ryder Cup match of his career.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cup seasons, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the greatest champion of all competitions with a total score of 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop it today.
This has really been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I was very happy to receive the cup.
Regarding my team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said of his feelings after the European victory.
He passed the torch to compatriot John Ram, who knocked out American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"It's proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and I admire him," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup tournament.
Statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were first among the tournament's highly qualified golfers.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they fought very well.
This morning we were in trouble due to the high temperatures in Europe.
We're out.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players on the team played very well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to play the PGA in the U.S. and the Ryder Cup and we’re going to continue to top the table.
I love all 12 players and I’m proud to be captain.
I take off my hat, guys.
We played very well.”
Update on Red Tide Phenomenon: Red Tide Density Declines in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the Red Tide has decreased in much of the Tampa Bay area.
Algae blooms have been reported in areas of the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – this has caused red tidal density to decrease.
The Red Tide phenomenon spreads for about 130 miles along the northern Pinellas coast to southern Lee County.
Small patches were also found within 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but fewer locations than last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium density along the coast or off the coast of Pinellas County has been reported over the past week, low to high density off Hillsborough County, low to high density in Manatee County, low to high density off the coast of Sarasota County, low to high density off Charlotte County, low to high density along the coast or offshore in Lee County, and low density in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
