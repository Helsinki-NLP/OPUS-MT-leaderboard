Tok hides unfortunate videos from users
According to dataTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are less than 18 years of age
Imagine China / Repositories
The Guardian reports that the Chinese network submits the video rolls in which the area is mentioned in Tibet, the independence of Tibet, or the prohibited religious group of Falungun.
The documents reported that the owner of Tok (byteDance company) continues the objectives of China's external policy in the midst of the road.
The basic part of the violations, the Casa of China's policy, is under the "break of hatred".
In any case, Tok places inappropriate penalties in the context of the general rules so that the network does not appear to be censured.
For example, the prohibition of the socialist of the system of China is generally prohibited by " criticism or attacks on politics and rules of any country such as constitutional mon, Parliamentary system, etc.".
The prohibition of mentioning incidents in the Territory of Tinanmeni or genocide in Kambodja is under the "explanation of the history of China or other countries".
The document also contains a list of prohibited names of "foreign leaders or public operators", including the Northern Korean Ruses of Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen Ina, the Indian Policy Mahatmu Gandi, the American Presidents Donald Trampa and Baraca Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sin Abe, the South Korean President Pack Khin Hi, President Joko Vido and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Mody, indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
The first category is removed by the socket administrators and the user may be locked.
Not too strict injuries are related to the second category: such incidences remain on the website, but they are distributed by algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules were older and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach and draw independent experts."
The Russian users do not have specific initiatives on the P.A., reports the "Producer Centre" Rustom Bogdans.
The "Producer Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with Tok.
All the advertising materials of the bloggers "Produser Centre" are covered with the representatives of the Society, but useless materials can be distributed, translated to Goddans.
The question is whether the Tok is able to speak about the policy or the Pu replies approvedly and states that he has seen such initiatives.
Goddans agrees with the foundation of Our Digital Roman Zaripo agency: "The basic rules for users are to be calculated in the user agreement:" to train a shocking content, discriminating statements and so.
But under these rules, any content that doesn't like the modernists can be subjected to Zariff.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner Tok.
According to the data, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are less than 18 years of age.
According to the user agreement, use of Tok may only be 13 years older.
Society administrators check their age by means of experimental intellectual: Neuronet analyses and determines how many years a person looks, Goddans reports.
If the neuroset decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBK, in September 2019 ByteDance opened a Office in Moscow in the WeWork Cowarding territory.
