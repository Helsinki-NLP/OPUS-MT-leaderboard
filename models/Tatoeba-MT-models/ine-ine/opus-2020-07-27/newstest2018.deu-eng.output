München 1856: Four cards that change your corner to the city
A mistake in which youths should meet today.
A gross capelle, which is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardens control the only reason for farmers.
The oldest of the map of Münchens promotes stressing stories to day.
It's nervous when land maps are not present.
This is what everyone who had to get up once knows because the car-navi placed an environmental road showing a green wheel.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, a boat of the Geoportal Bayers of the Government, are all other than the current - but so very open.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it will be clearly how cities and communities have changed in the division area of Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.
The Digital Bayern Atlas is a ticket that you do not recognize as such.
The large survey cards were included for towns and communities more detailed cards, called the replacement sheets.
These occurred, according to the data of the Bayer Measurement Management between 1810 and 1864, and resulted from the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your employee: Napoleon.
The French military leader has occupied Bayers since early 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted a review of the occupied country and gave a topographic record of Bayerns in order - naturally for military purposes.
Even if the French troops departed from Luneville's peace from 9 February 1801 s日: It was the modern neighbors who created the idea of a lowly covering Bayern map.
As Max IV. Joseph continued to broaden the project, the "Topographic Bureau" was founded and thus the Bayer Mixing Management.
The replacement sheet for München comes from 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bayer National Library.
The comparison of early and today is the most impressive in the country headquarters.
The city has spread into all directions and is grown together.
An example of this is a subsemit, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as Münchner city part.
Today there is a submission in the middle of the city.
In 1856, the home submissions were able to run around the current Plinganser street, named first to Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bayer farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, there is nothing to look like fields - on the first angle: In zooming, a smaller map with duzening lines and numbers appears: manually numbered flows from the so-called "reception" from which the basic tax was removed.
Small parcells show no more farmers - but small gardens of the "Land in the Sun".
A large green area is off northward from undersendling.
The Teresian show, since 1810 the October Festival, was actually a widow - and no beton wilderness in the 19th century.
On the other hand of Isar, the history card gives an insight in the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urposition Sheet, not only in the area of the modern area Au-Haidhausen, you read the road names "a gastrip" or from the added "on the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfield Street, people were locked once with guards.
There was 1858/59 the Münchner Circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Airports".
Since 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment - that psychiater, which is brought in relation to the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the investigation of the so-called mistakes.
"He has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the insects," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has been employed for an exhibition with the staff.
For 280 patients there was a place too, later it was extended to 500 places.
At any time, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the building of the circles in Haar 1905.
There has been the Isar-Amper-Clinic München-East since 2006, one of the largest psychiatries of Germany.
In the area of the former auer office, youths are now meeting in Münchner Salesianum.
The order made the building complex in 1920 and moved it into a youth home with training agents.
Westernly, the football place of the TSV München East is residents from the 1980s.
In 2015, Casa Don Bosco, the Child House, was created in the Tectonical Release to the originating building of the Ireneanstalt, which was severe in the World War II in bomb attacks.
The Marine Place was devoted to "Haupt space" in 1856, named "Kaping Gase".
The second World War II also changed a decision in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allied rided in December 1944 a lot of lowers in the interior city.
A big man remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, Small Business Houses and a greenhouse from the Mediterranean were at the Marienhof, where these days were prepared, and on 5 April 2017 the S-Bahn staff stick was held.
With the slider, the old Mountain Card can be compared to the air image of today - and fill the loch on the marine hof.
Civil law group publishs a travel warning for Missouri
The national unit for the promotion of colors has made a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri due to discrimination and the racism attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advice for the Federal State Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, requests afro-American travellers, sugars and missouriers to take special attention in travels through the State and to give outstanding attention, since a series of racial events are recently present in the entire state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently dismissed law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination claims, as well as the criminal prosecutors of the State, which aimed unrelatedly on minorities, made the group to give the trip warning, said the NAACP.
"You have damages of civil rights that enhance human rights.
They will be arrested because of their skin color, they will be joined or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such an anxiety that we have not yet heard."
It is the first warning that the organization has made for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racism crimes against black students in the face of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no benzine anymore during the trip by the State and was observed by Missouri's police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report of the Office of Missouri's State Advocate General, which shows that black carriers in the State are held more often than white than 75 Pro.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and workers about what could be done in Missouri," said the Chapel.
"The people need to be ready or bring money to the rent or let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
Missouri committed 100 hatred crimes in 2015, after the latest numbers of the FBI hate crime reporting programme, which decreased the State in respect of the number of such damage to the 16th range of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to complain a company for the discrimination of apartment or employment.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arivána after the states had predicted immigration laws, committed local criminals to arrest people because of immigration crimes, which will be taken to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have adopted the action as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Continue project is elementary
The fisherman Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU-Bund-day lawyers Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture in place.
In the case of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU-Location Conference met with citizen Thomas Schneider and both members.
Markus Schwendemann granted insights in his business, where he managed 55 hectares and 40 hectares of the forest, 40 milk bows and many young animals, and in five apartments heirs.
The "Schwarzwald milk" is the alternative way for the milk of his cattle, such a greenhouse.
The board of vacation guests is outside Regionales.
Since he is also a BLHV president of the fisherbach, he covered the project as "elements important".
I can't win the economy on such stealing areas.
The Greenland area provides a lot of work, many things must be handled with the engines.
"We have to fight with the conditions and toophography," stressed the widow.
2003, he took the older operation and managed it without chemical pf protection and dunger, even if he did not carry out bio-business.
For citizens, Thomas Schneider was clear: "The commune has recognized the importance of the project and is happy for the Leader Progress."
Costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare should be supported by agricultors.
It is hoped that there may be a long time to extinguish the surfaces.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in the agriculture and think about how they continue to carry out their operation," emphasized the citizen.
The agricultors are often in criticism because of support
A total of 25 parts of eleven participators were charged in 2013.
The opening area is 40 hectares that cannot be formed until at least 2023.
From the total amount of 71 500 euros, the half of Leader was promoted, a quarter of the Fisherbach community.
Thus, the agricultors remained 12 610 euros, which had to invest in 16,2 miles [16,2 km].
"The great advantage is the long life of the moon," said the widowman.
Cordula Kovac stressed: "You do a good job, without farmers and farmers, it doesn't happen."
Peter White also said: "The best food is produced here."
The Landscape Division (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the State's support of Wednesdays.
The goal is the opening of the black forest.
The conditions are the existing part of a subsidiarity covered by the LPR.
The inflammable surface must not be able to be adequately managed (appeal over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by the inflammation.
For the fisherbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the request of eight participants is currently running with 24 parts that want to build nearly 16 km of pound.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Isn't it anymore?
Now the white house of Trump takes the freedom status
The most safe character of a regime exchange is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans also appreciate this as everyone else - therefore the carefully inscenated Sturz Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideals of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a heavy fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic restriction of legal immigration with freedom statue.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lighted him if he had done it.
But he accepted their importance, and particularly the importance that was written to her, when the famous weight of Emma Lazarus was added to Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the thinking of his base.
As Miller Acosta, "I don't want to go here to a complete thing about history, but the freedom status is... a symbolic freedom that lights the world.
The weight you are concerned, which was later added and is not part of the original freedom statue."
Miller is really right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It's about the modern resonance to Lazarus' oppressive words, the only ones in which a state is not only an old immigrant but also the poorest of the poor: "Your weaknesses, your arms, / your weak mass that seems to be free to breathe, / the suffering waste de ́s costs."
There was never a time when the "learning waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he cleared that these people were not welcome in the United States of Trumps.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a widespread political and cultural complication: it is actually a conflict with the importance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they completed a high-political action.
The sculpture should demonstrate the connections between French and the Republicanism by representing the female body of freedom in a useful classic representation.
Lazarus changed this importance: In her mouth the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the weight to the image is a feminist coup and a devastating attack on the Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to turn this back from the right wings for a long time.
The big Rush Libaugh, a kind of John the Baptizer for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the state of freedom was not invited to anyone but is a former neoconservative, which brings the flame of the Lady Liberty into the nightly world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It will have the bridge of freedom from the United States in the world.
The fashion must not light the way to the United States."
Libaugh is quite unusual here.
The importance of the statue is a question of the position of adoption.
The great fantastic effect of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the created, afflictive, but hopeful people after long and often horrible travels on the cover of ships.
It is true to see the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that wants to recognize Miller and Trump ever.
Their fashion should not light the way, but burn the hate that is their only source of power.
World Mastership 2017: Neil Black lo _BAR_ Schottic members of the British team
Eilith Doyle recalls at a time when only two shots belonged to the British team
Neil Black, Director of the United Kingdom's Leightathletics, says that the 16-cooked Schottic Contingent in the World Mastership Country "a massive contribution to the team" will be granted.
A record number of Scotch Athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "seeing develops something special in Scotland" and the light athletic of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scotch Athletes think that there's something to do with what they've done.
British Light Athletic: It has something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy on the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolute."
Many of the Scotch athletes are medallian advocates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will be attacked against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m streams, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the master to the team captain.
"Elith is quite modesty.
Your Captain's talk was incredible," says Black.
"A series of atletes, whether they were schottic or wherever they live or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The patience and the real feeling that Eilidh brought out, of course, were great."
The Commonwealth silver metal winner, which will reach its fifth world masterships at the 400-m heirs, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 shots are in the British community.
Scotland’s best total number of athletes at the World Mastership was seven, reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Mediterranean Moir leads this way and has set up five British and two records in the past year.
It will be shared in the 1.500 m and 5.000 m of floor.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that includes winning in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls its first world masterships when the only other shot was in Lee McCon’ team.
The majority captain says that she is "enormous proud" on the fact that many of her people belong not only to the team, but in some cases they will be mixed with the medals and the finals.
"The behaviour of being team-captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was also a great honor, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, it makes it something worthwhile for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the shots belonging to the team.
It only shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes that want to ascend on the podies.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home-wide mastership.
So it is really important to put on this householding and benefit from that we are again in the Olympia stadion.
I'll get a second chance to go out there and competite, and it'll just be a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not be a public office if you can't make the choice of electors
The father of our country knew something about bad pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long until the newspapers killed him because of everything, from the internal policy to his political principles.
He shot in the criticism, sure.
But he didn't make his critics weak.
For in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed - and, stupid and stupid, we will be brought as the sheep to the battle."
This leads me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and removed the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him about the beginning of this week.
The staff of the Governor rejected the complaint as freevol, and the online comment was filled with an opposite reaction with "Wel, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republican Governor in a surprising democracy state, which is amazingly popular.
He has the secondest agreement of the 50 governments of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leading of his state and strict compliance with the princes.
He was also very sent in using Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and playing his free head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum which is officially covered by employees paying with public tax-dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately annual.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a processing.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swim the pitche online.
The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a teacher, and a pharmacist, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thinking and not profan.
The pair cited the Bible in posts and invited Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but asked for hate crime.
"I had to comment that I was deceived that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages," she wrote in the comment area of the "The Post" message.
"I don't even appreciate this idea when a number of people take place on the same subject, they will be deceived by some more than a so-called collective use and not as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the Governor's workers claimed as "convergenced spam attack" would probably be called "for" others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critical or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that workers were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines or to arrest demonstrants and to weak.
But that's exactly digital.
Hogan is not the first public officer who is criticized that he has a Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is charged by Twitter users blocked by Twitter feed.
One of the first milensteins in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The president of the Board of Supervisor of Loudoun County hurt the first amendment, according to the US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she dismissed a elector from her Facebook site.
And in Kent́ky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a rubber from the LU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At Washington’s time, the time of the troubled ports had a similar effect like the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters attacked his leader.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonymes such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to magazines that reduce Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticize his position on the Amity Treaty, the trade and the ship carrier with the United Kingdom, overcome his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring them to silence.
Freedom, opinions and talks are based on our nation.
And true lead means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoped for home comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is the 25th department of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northir, which led down the past year in Archerfield Links to the end before he lost Paul Eales, has been connected to the new exhibition site and works as tourists in the name of the founder and CEO's Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reached his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous defensor of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The English Eales is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although he has won in his 32-year-old car both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels especially," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open, since it was taken from the program in the year after I won it.
To return to this part of the world is magic.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
The reminders come back from the last year, and it was something to do for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who comes to the European Senior Tour after 50. Birthday this year, returns to action on home grounds.
This event will be his first Scotch event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do it well, but you're also looking at this adequate pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad that it's been so far."
With the trio on the field, the former Master Sieger Ian Woosnam and the ancient Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Cup Captain Sam Torrance belong to the six shots on the field, other are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry is free, the parking space costs £5 per car with a inside and £10 per car with two or more insects.
All redemptions go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Small long cancer by passbows
In the past two years, less people have died because of passion of long cancer.
This is the result of the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"After our failures, 167 long cancer cases are caused to passbows," said Heiko Becher's leader.
As a comparison, he set up a personal point on this topic in 1994.
At that time, there were 400 long cancer cases in Germany because of passengers per year.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home encounters are very complex
The building works in the Villinger Street are completely and "look sometimes in the time", as the leader of the Bauhofs Fred Heinze.
In the field of household agreements, the situation is more complex than expected, since it is much hidden in the underground, which is not marked in the plans.
The responsibility that always prevents building work is a great problem for the building group of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of car drivers before red locks and locks is already enormous," he reports Heinze.
The street is locked and only line buses are allowed to run.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been employed for weeks with work at the bridge.
"The heavy days were very nice.
But for lucky, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cold mineral water," said Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei buys the dinner, she doesn't use herd.
She even uses a top rarely.
In his Holzhaus in Enarotali, the capital city of the Panii government in the insult Indonesian province of Papua, the housewoman usually places a sweet carton - locally as "nota" - directly in the camel.
After a half hour, the cold node will be taken and burned with yellow, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the lemboden - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example clothes with thirsty water from the nearby soap.
A egg in an uncovered room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned to fields.
Polygamy is usually here.
Of course, it may be late to work.The majority of the villages are unemployment, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one waits to run in the village after 17 hours," she says.
It is a rare view of the daily life in Papua, a former Netherlands colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a conflicted referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elders should vote by a public exhibition before the occupation struggles.
An existing movement that touched the independence against the Netherlands Government was quickly contrary to the Government of Jakarta, which undermines the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003 the province official was divided in Papua and Western Papua, including the independent part of Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is as far as it is dead. The travel includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car car car with the car.
There are no public resources.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wood houses that are surrounded by bambossons, and of well-bled tears converted by rose into different green sounds.
Only a few Indonesians have made their travel here, but not journalists and practically no strangers.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to be clothing," Degei said, "and demanded on her lively, handweared tourban, her dark hair and her light rock.
"Before we had only leaves on our body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty border and some of the worst children's death and alphabetisation rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian Goldland.
The biggest and profitable goldmine in the world, Grasberg, in the owner of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Panai, a town province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport was built in a value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua provides wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia’s powerful military keeps a strong presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport was paying local military citizens and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer.
Papuanic requests for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are treated without delay.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been controlled, persecuted and arrested by Indonesian military since 1969.
In the 1970s, food deaths in Papua Stammeshochland were made in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission for People's Morde.
Only in the region, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will all lose" means in a report of the Erzdioze Brisbane of 2016, which contains the report on the Grew date of the previous year, such as irregular reactions and folters - administration and electricity are particularly indicated after another report - and the brutal reduction of peaceful demonstration.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, since every week occurs," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian Researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened because Papua resources bring a stream of seedlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrations come from the populating islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian warning cantics covered brased huhn and Gado-Gado, serves a mixed tree with earth sauce.
Local people were fighting to keep here.
"The migrants have started to acquire cheapers and vegetables on the traditional market more likely than the local Papua," said Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panii enemy in the province of Jayapura.
"It has made the domestic Papua - mother [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian State President Joko Widodo, in the Volksmund as Jokowi, promised during his election fight in 2014 to take place the inequalities and legal damage in Papua.
The former roomman safeguarded 27 of the 29 districts of Papua Panii on the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, a little change has changed, and today the inhabitants feel disturbed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi 2014, with the hope that he will fulfil our hopes that the righteousness will be restored," says You.
In fact, Panii only two months after Jokowi's invitation in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a store fire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers on a motor radiation through darkness.
The scared kids told them that they should activate their swords.
One of the soldiers took anxiety to his sound and later returned with four soldiers, such as the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drunk, jaged and struck the group with their weapons, said sacrifices and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers celebrated the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulian Yeimo, was so hardly struck that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government committee was placed in fire and the things were scaled on the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered themselves at a football place before the local police station and the military order to request justice.
They brought ceremonial jailbows and brought the Waita-tanz - running in the circle and imitating a bird song - from the Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrants began to flash stones on police and military posts.
When the vote was rehearsed, the soldiers were sent a command through a internal radio: "If the masss had more than three times resist, they shoot them dead," it says in a official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Jeremia Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kago Koto-Virtel of Enarotali, saw the threatening and called to rest and asked the multitude to return home.
No one was listening to the vote.
"When I turned around, suddenly I was shot into my left handsheet," he said TIME on the veranda of his wooden woods.
Kayame still doesn't know who has earned, but he says that the ball came from the orders of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overwhelmed, many shoes were sworn," he added.
The inheim man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, the Witness of the shooting.
"I traveled to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said Johanes, who, as many Indonesians wears only a name, the TIME in dark voice.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Popua Police's head pointer, Yotje Mende, reporters said that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us to kill us," said the speaker of Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrants were killed and many other hurt.
The message about murder came to Yakarta on the next day.
Three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura held a suffering speech in which he expressed sympathies for the victims' families and sweared to come to the historical disasters in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not be forwarded in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an exceptional mechanism for the establishment of historical human rights violations.
But the expressions started almost immediately.
"The most harms have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and beginning of the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed us to commit these violations, but there are processes to be carried out," he said.
Then Viranto made a backtrace when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be regulated legally," he said.
Wiranto, who has been accused of "kriminality against mankind", who requested more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor bloody independence voting in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been added to the Panii prejudice.
The families of the Panii victims took such disbeliefs with angry unbelievingness.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still inside years later.
"I have," he said.
"I have been arrested by the military, have been shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Panii have had to discuss the incident.
He says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"When I buried the body, the military looked for me," he said.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Wednesday, the Indonesian police shot the village in Panai Neighbourhood Deiyai.
As a counterfeit between village residents and the Manager of a building pharma, who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one died, and 17 others were hurt, including children.
The man, who was a 24-year-old Ravia® Douw, who was drunk when he was throwing in a nearby flow, died on the way to the hospital.
Resorted village residents protested before the company's location office.
The police said that the villages were casting stones on Offer, who reacted to it by burning warning shoes.
But domestics say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started to shoot the amount and killed a person.
"We were so in panic, we have found that there will be a race," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness, as the damaged here has been quickly delivered, as the TIME.
"I have hided me two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called to take the shared officers into account and to remove the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Panii was always an insult for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the insatisfaction of the tribe citizens of See, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the Green Hochland of Papua.
The "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebellious army, which claims to defend Papua's rights by attacking sporadic attacks and delays of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Panii, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a reaction to this, thousands of people in Panai have been arrested in the past years, and have been willingly observed, under the prevention of the "Security of the National Sovereignty".
Some don't get up again.
Among the people in Papua, Panii is "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens the unconsciousness.
The little trip, which is rebuilt in Enarotali, is too deep for domestic.
The bread is the same outside the royalway.
People here build everything they eat, especially notes and fruits and sheets.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet carton.
They keep the majority of the greenhouse for the family while it is packed on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupias (75 cents).
During the time, economic inequalities have grown between the inhabited Papua and the new migrants, which have reached in greater number since the creation of new flights to the Nabire airport.
The small jobs in the region are usually to the better educational and well-hearing migrants.
Papua often has the capital or the ability necessary to lead its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Council of the Tribe of Panii.
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting are stressed by international media.
In the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with relatives from Papua, although they were given the rare authorisation for films.
According to Phelim China, the representative director of the Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election battle were not realized to highlight the limitations of the reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new features for foreign journalists who are trying to report from the most disturbing provinces of Indonesia from Papua and West Papua: Visa refus and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of pressure control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the direct neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - were invited to investigate the United Nations Human Rights Council "different and broadly spread damage" in Papua.
The same countries have historically seen the OPM support.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir revealed the projects of the group and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia still exists a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to disturb the evidence of human rights."
People want to know more foreign governments.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leading of the human rights bootscape Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, the inhabitants inhabited their weaknesses and claimed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wants to be shared at the session, but anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Panai shots," Gobai, the president of the Council of the tribe.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai people, except that it is under the continuous threat of a ruberian military, is in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, such as other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "shuld" that he must pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the distress and inquiries, the family of the Panii-shoot victims conducted a last symbolic act of fierceness: the body of a victim was buried in a territory exactly against the police and military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they will not forget the responsible for their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," Yacobus says with a darkened head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire takes the 'Torch' cloud shorter of Dubai for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai, his browsing and forced hundreds of residents to flee from 337 metres high, 79-stocked buildings.
It's the second brand that carries the high house in only two years, which will eventually be called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tourm).
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have slept, and we are raised up in the alarm of fire and in the crying of people.
We split the steps down, and it was about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th eight", said a resident who called his name as George, Ree.
Dubai civil protection participants said that the units of the fire combat against 4.00 p.m. (00.00 p.m. GMT) remove the fire and cold the building.
The Government said she was working to provide accommodations for the concerned.
The incident can re-examinate questions on safety of materials used in foreign areas of households worldwide.
An investigation through the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage came from the clothing, the outer clothing for decoration or isolation.
In Britain, the police said that she believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Greenfell tour in June could have arrived to the quick spread of a fire, where about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup reform: Forward Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has been conducted with a large Davis-Cup coop at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was supported to play Davis-Cup egg only on two winnings, not by the necessary two-third majority.
Although they are often very long, but even therefore the very appreciated five Sats Classic remains obtained by the traditional claim.
63.54 Pro · Member States agreed to the reform, therefore, the objective of President David Haggerty was simply deteriorated.
"We respect this decision, but we are deceived that our members have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve the applications.
The proposal was not only to vote on the basis of many votes before the proposal to bring the final to a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only smaller details: Thus the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the guest right future in the following year in the first year.
To decrease the costs for the operators, the requirements in things will be easier and the players will need to resolve less of official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US travelers bring prohibited objects into a flight, find an investigation
A survey under flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent of objects who were conscious or unconsciously prohibited at the control points of the US Transportation Security Security, including at least 6 per per cent, which included the flight, while they were carrying deteriorated meals or other objects with sounds.
Less than 1 Pro replied that they would have discovered lately that they were traveled irregularly with shooting weapons, munitions or sprays.
The survey of more than 1,000 persons - which were conducted by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also stated that younger travellers had already missed the rules.
From the questionnaires who said that they were scientifically trying to flee with something prohibited by the TSA were 19.7% of the Millennials, compared to less than 15%, which were members of the generation X.
The most common items that have been prevented from TSA agents were foods and liquids.
More than 3% were given to have knownly been held by sounds through safety control, while 2,2% of women's questions and 3,7% of men's questions were also assured that they would have brought to the flight adequately prohibited.
The company said that it had asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many of the deceased shiftware would have brought through the aircraft security and how many would have done it probably.
It is not surprised that the people who were in the first smuggleware - scientist or inconscient - by security were those who were most frequently running.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are something complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they may take or how much of them.
It is therefore not surprised that the largest amount of liquids prohibited by the TSA.
For a long time, people thought that the TSA could view books as smugglingware.
Flights are allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Ten thousand Tesla-Kunden order
Electro-Thusandsassa Elon Musk is pleased with the large number of orders for his new tesla "Model 3".
He has so far claimed that some of the customers have already returned their unbinding reservation.
Besides the always triumphal numbers for conversion increases and even more gigantic paragraph targets, Tesla-Cheef Elon Musk has first delivered another, less g intervall number: the storages at the new mass model 3.
Musk had often performed more than 500,000 prescriptions for the new car in the past months, whose delivery just started.
Now Musk is invoked: From the total of 518.000 supplies, 63.000 have already been returned.
The criticians have always remarked that it was only unbinding reservations.
In a storage, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United States 1000 Pounds) "Reservation payment" completely.
Currently, 455.000 of these unconnected reservations have been presented, and Musk has been placed in a phone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that it could be a problem with the storage of about 12 pro of all orders.
His argument: The challenge to the enormous growth objectives is not at the request, but on the production site.
Last year, Tesla spent 84,000 vehicles.
2018 should it - all models together - be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The question is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings for the day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today may consider the delivery first in the second half of the year 2018 - if Tesla is able to renew his neck, never tested production routes in practice without bigger interruptions with maximum charge.
Experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, the independence of reservations could become the problem of Tesla.
Because then, the company cannot prevent unconscious customers from running away in a lot.
EPA-Cheef Pruitt turns back because of the delay of the rules of Obama Era to reduce emissions
On one day after he was charged by 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environment Protector, returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era to reduce the emissions and caused aircraft.
Pruitt presented the change when its Agency demonstrated the needs of the State environmental participants to respond more rapidly than the current administration.
He did not refer to the complaint which was raised against his previous position in a federal court.
It is about a period that has expired for States on 1 October to meet the standards of 2015 for the nearby ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would leave the compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "reduction in local decisions or economic growth".
Pruitt, who before his nomination by President Donald Trump, was a long time a reliable opposer of strict environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival to Washington, Pruitt has recently been transferred to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are opposed.
The sudden round from midweek is the latest legal recovery for the Pritis regulatory Rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama administration, the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reduction of methanecks.
In a middle weekendly published opinion, Pruitt suggested that his turnovers at Ozon standards simply strengthen the preparation of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of modern acquisition of new standards.
"The EPA has often not held the terms for implementation and then expected to be accused of activist groups and others, and to set the date for implementation in an agreement," Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a decade of times in the previous job.
"We do not believe in a rule through court procedures, and we take periods seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority we have."
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt once would use his "leasing power and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "based on solid and the best available information".
The Republicans in the Congress are forced to make a comprehensive resumption of the Ozone rules.
A draft legislative approved in the last month will delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The Advocate-General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had accused the EPA this week, said to keep the group in mind to maintain the legal pressure.
"The environment of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and security of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the EPA that streams in their communities," Sneiderman said.
In this case, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, ↓, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Colombia.
Earth ozone occurs when damage from cars, power works, oil raffinies, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emergency organ can cause serious breathing problems in sensible groups of people, and thousands of previous deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and the environment of jubels were surprisingly changed in the course of pressure.
"It's unfortunate how much pressure it had to take to this reasonable step from the responsibility for the protection of the air we receive," Lori Ann Burd said from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crossing of the Trump Government to offer ourselves to environmental pollutants and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: In addition to the Jubilea of the mountain church, the old Friedhof Area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, will be invited to a serenade at 16.30 p.m.
Whether his idylic position and beautiful view of the township is the historical St. Hilarius facility a popular place to defeat.
The sugars of the sixth benefit series can be removed from this powerful place.
The salvation and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promotors of tumling their place.
Walter Martini stresses: "It's a unique potential littlehood."
In 1267, the St. Hilariucapelle was originally instructed in the Württemberg Original Book: Graf Hermann of Sulz forgot "the mountain with the existing church to Tumlingen and Vogtei" to Mr. Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the initiative was found on the Tumling Mountain, other than the only church of the Pharrric Church, too, a famous court to which the church or the patronat law belonged and was not surrounded.
So there were people there.
According to the description of the Supreme city of joy in 1858, near the village and the surrounding village, which are now in the local image of Tumlingen, the "berg" of the village, the famous seat of the village.
Old cards from time to time around 1600 undermine these historical events.
The patronate right was based on the early age of own church.
A master, who built a church, exhausted and occupied with a pair, remained owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was the right to use a pair or to propose a new pair to the Bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two hours on the tour.
The size of the two is nearest at Christmas 1673.
The newly created clock was then the first time in 1692, but later the second world war had to be released in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the windows were thrown and shot the locks.
The cup was unclean.
1796 French troops stood near the church.
They set out the cancels and church chairs and used them as a burning wood.
The rest of the Church threatened 1809 to break in.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-F’hof also served as the last relax for the dead from listeners.
1823 the Friedhof was extended and the Hilarius church was canceled.
Only the church turm was left.
At the New Year night of 1834, a storm split the church turm and the half of the church.
To prevent a disaster, the tour was canceled.
Only today’s tourists remained witnesses of the 750 - year - old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Shaffy Rentners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility.
As agents, friends and promotors of Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, invite to the sixth Serenade on the old Friedhof to St. Hilariucapelle.
This is made by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium, a pleasure city and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The local president Hartmut Romann speaks the conclusion.
The programme starts at 16.30 p.m.
Income is from 15.30 p.m.
For the purpose of the Serenade, there's a beverage before the Friedhof.
"Eat a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the white-cock over shows to the woods," the insects show the fantastic look.
The Serenade is only located at dry weather.
The engineers hope for many undertakers to obtain the historical St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumling and auditors.
The friends and promotors of Tumlingen are particularly binding in the home management, as Serenade-Organizator Walter Martini confirms.
Unity wants to check the approval of wind-drawers
"Boisheim turns back" does not see legal conditions for the building and therefore turned to the Court of Agriculture.
The "Boisheim" unit invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to return its authorisation for the creation of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer network.
It's been done legally.
The Unit argues that at the date of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Network, no wind power plants could have been approved because there was only a wind-force consolidation zone at the time in four in the city border to Swalmtal.
Inside this convergence zone, the building and operation of wind energy facilities are essentially possible, but the convergence zone affects the exclusion of the wind energy extent for the rest of the city.
Such zones will prevent the landscape.
Although the city of Firesen had a few days ago, by changing the plan of use of the area, a second wind power convergence zone in the Boisheimer Web - which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a form of error.
"In the lack of planning law, the approved disclosure is as before and therefore returning, and therefore," Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim is speaking."
Current state of things: The town Council has re-contained the windkon·rationation zone in the Boisheimer network before the summer pause; an approving of the district government remains.
Recognizing: "In this place, the authorisation for the creation of wind energy facilities is legally excluded."
The circle will approve the entry of the request.
"The corresponding writings have been entered at the Circle Four," said a speaker.
The circle takes it to be able to review the matter again.
However, they are probably not leading to the suspension of the procedure.
With a view to running procedures at the administrative court, the circle would not have been expressed on Thursday to the argumentation of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a daughter company of the NEW, plants on a surface on the Boisheimer Web the building of wind trees from four to 200 meters high.
In the past year, the company in which the city of 4ersen was directly shared had concluded contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of a large country.
With the creation of the four wind energy facilities, the energy need is to be covered by around 11 400 households, which corresponds to a fifth of the energy need for all four-seen households.
The NEW Re wants to invest approximately 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Quartersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the wind park Linnich at Aachen and a share in a wind energy facility in Übach-Palenberg in the circuit Heinsberg.
Car and tractor break together: Woman stirs in a terrible accident
A terrible disturbance accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 hours at the L 333 between NederWall Menach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
One woman was killed.
Two other persons were easily hurt.
The country road remained locked over hours.
Following police data, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her pkw, in the context of the car with her 53-year-old mother, carried the L 333 in direction of Bogel.
City and traders plan "Hoimat Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will re-detect the purchasing opportunities in the town in September.
The warrior and the town manager want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lock the inhabitants for the income bullshit in the city.
As the President of the Conference, Christian King, announced, the "Heimat-shoppen" clients should be prepared for which offers the city without the usual super-wears.
Thereafter, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the week.
In addition, home companies should be presented with their education sites.
Furthermore, the internal town's businesses will be invited to "Mitternights-shoppen".
The action is not only to the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertising pots are in the radio, a Internet video and printed puzzles, which indicate the end of the action week, as Christian King.
Civil management and construction are cooperating with the industry and trade room.
This is how the conference and the city go to another stage of the "Attractive Inside City" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Future Festival as well as the conquered Sunday, talks with all operators and producers to move them to the active participation.
Also attractive boats for Saturday and the delay on parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
Moreover, customer potential should be restarted or restarted.
It belongs to Kurgasters and Tourists.
But many inhabitants would also have lost the town inside when they were purchased from the corner.
At the end, everyone must live in the town of the town - until the town's operations and the United States.
With a network, it could overcome the lathargy that was partly broadcast, King said in the early year.
Birgit Streich, leader of the IHK Center in Mühlhouses, told that the "Himat-Shoppen" day would share five towns first.
Besides Bad Langensalza, this widow, Sömmerda, Santa City and Bleicherode.
The day is to "reduce for the assessment of the local trade and make its importance to the common selection of our cities" as a strike.
The action under the IHK Federation and with many partners also indicates that every citizen with purchasing behaviour can influence his own direct environment.
Two dead and several damage after explosion in US School

At the vacation, only few people stayed in the building of Minnehaha Aëmy.
Trump pressed after sure transcripts of phone calls Mexico because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump asked at a telephone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the United States joined him because he had publicly approved the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "It is not the way you can't say to the press."
Trump started his presidency campaign with the promise of creating a wall at the southern border of the United States and swearing to leave Mexico for the project.
The transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and enthothed an advanced exchange.
Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States of refugees who were emigrants would be "smiled", "mies" and "em" and that the existence of the trade delivered by the Government of Obama would look like a "deep" after he proposed a prohibition for the conversion of refugees in the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unappreciated call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massacher: Activists lead racism Lynchact as a call for justice again
A 1948's Ford Mercury passed through a group of viewers in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and joined the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men arose with weapons to block his way.
The leader of the mobs - a man of the middle age in a needle streeping race - took a long train on his cigarette and looked at the wind protection vessels.
Drines were in fear of the insects.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" the man burned.
"Stop him out of the car!"
Crying breaks the silence when a young black man was cut off from the carrier's seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene that was played on 22 July is only a proof.
But then, when a sling around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the public is cut off very real seefers.
Since 2005, citizen judges return to Moore's Ford Bri to follow the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey were held by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever accused of murder.
"It is really unfair that in all these years no one was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the seed.
"It's a shit on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congress Deputy of Georgia and a long-term citizen judge.
For him, the opinion serves as a dramatic call for action and gives an annual reminder to the Monroe Community that a wrong has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want health, we want reconciliation, but first we need to receive justice," he said.
"We can't get to health and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A Court Medicinal Act shall put a bed on the body of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graves were suspicious in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the disputes have remained on free foot since years, citizen judges say that the double motivation for the Lynch action in the entire city was always: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to take their voice for the first time in the pre-elected fight in the summer.
At the same time as the election, the FBI's black farmer Roger Malcom's white base owner, Barnett Hester, during a battle down - seemedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the horse in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she brought was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white owner of the country, paid to release Malcom from prison, as the FBI.
He was joined by Dorothy and their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey in prison.
But when they went away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bri's, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"How it seems, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murder," a FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a complex between the state and local criminal persecution, which was not only involved in murder, removed evidence and discovered the ability of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it more famous.
"It was a choice-maskaker," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this Community: "If you let yourself register, and if you vote, this will make you."
Almost a year ago Cassandra Greene has led the annual opinion of Moore Ford Bri ́ Lynch's death.
Your representation is visible, comprehensive and is based on a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe that he does not exist in America anymore.
It's difficult to look, and even more weak, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the linch because then we are confronted with his cruelty in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not to hear what I have passed."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 showers - a dozen white and the swarm - in a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the track.
Wade Marbaugh is a Green's co-register here.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said the role would never be easier.
"I feel sick because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other hand of the room, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried to play their lines.
The track begins with Malcom, the horseman, and he's disturbing him, wherever he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, go away from my own!"
Rascona's going to defeat the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all the black players) will fall into laughs.
Greene's laughing.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kissing.
"I just don't think white people said a -- he" at that time."
"But," one of the other black representatives.
"You just need to get the hard R."
And exactly there is the energy in the room, a feeling of camerady replaces the unappreciation.
Everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it scarce and inpressed.
Absolutely no one laughed.
This repeat ends violently and quickly.
There's crying, shooting, and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a trembling clothing, is over the body of the players and carries Billie Holidays grievous lobred "Strang Fruit".
Your voice breathes with each second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four decades views switch and trees out of the eyes.
The public is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple is traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the training, many just come down the street.
They all have almost eight hours pressure in Georgia when Brooks lead them on a trip to the funeral places of Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murder remains an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder was found, the air feels spently.
When the last notes of the song appear, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspecte the body name.
Children rise on their heads, register the older blood and the silent body and flee each other.
"You're not really dead," murms a little boy like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks for the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The sight players throw the Lynchseil and remove their tears.
Bradshaw covered Marbaugh, the man in the shot that played the member.
Nick Rascona swarms two of his fellow players and then weeps together in their arms, and the emotional burden of the introduction is broken by him.
"It's okay," one of the women claims.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later the public will be together with the players for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta is stuck over the conception with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struck for finding words that have left the introduction.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... from people who look like yourself and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me, let me believe that the linen is still going on," she adds, "that is just called police shooter today."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's court holds on table, eats and refers to citizens' rights.
He said he had already started planning the training in the next year.
"The presence is in some way inspiring, because it describes the fear of what we have of him, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like that if we're not learning anything from it, then it's able to restore it.
Whoever doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
"God's darkness" translated the carriers in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagners' monumental work, Regisseur Frank Castorf places a bunt-frivolous inscenation before giantical, six-scale culies.
The tournamental feet (constructed by Aleksandar Denic) selectively shows a fashionable road neck, as well as the wall resorts and dæmons in Berlin, a "plaste and Elaste" log from DDR-times or the New Yorker Börs.
Before this, a open Mercedes old time parks in which the daughters are placed as Rockergirls, or an alternative isa.
Stapeled oil eggs remind Castorfs Guitmotive - money, power and gier - which is going through his "Ring" inscenation.
The three royal daughters - singing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Ste日 - harmonize as well as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), closing a body in Hollywood-Manier and giving the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sing the glorious vegetable garden around the Aura of a weight boxer.
Brutal the scenes when he gets a victory.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The public thanks to En日 with powerful applause.
Foster, Milling, Winke, and Dirigent Janowski, who humbles and formed the hands to the marker road.
There is a big incident for the Festival Orchester, which appears first on the stage - in view of the great heat again in a military free-time clothing.
It was expected that Frank Castorf and ́ Regie team arrived.
If he had to take up a valid pipe-concert in 2013, there was five years later a big jubilee in which the "bow" rubber had fallen.
Katharina Wagner may have been happy for it.
"One notices that the public is assembled with the "Ring" in a certain way," she said shortly before the dpa was introduced.
The public has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it is also an understanding for its view.
I'm going to take a positive summary.
Max Amount as volunteer
They work in their voluntary year at a number of places.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the mobbers, once in the week I help here in Greven in the mobber.
And I've been at school on the open day.
How are your experiences with that?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with youths, with refugees, with young wake up.
You're 26 years old, so a late-proclaimed volunteer.
How's it going?
Quantity: I've made Abitur.
And then a building engineering study, let's say, cancelled.
I recognized for me that it's wrong for me and I want to do something else, working with people.

And was that?

For me, that was exactly the right thing that encouraged me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Other than in the building study?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people's head, each other's got a very different story behind.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been extracted from the family should always enter into it individually.
Very interesting.

There are even negative moments, but that's the same life.
Pearson reduces more 3.000 jobs and reduces the divisions to restore the business
The British Education Group, Pearson, said on Friday, will reduce more 3000 workshops and reduce their inter-divisions by 72 Pro, since another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure that the company has been confronted.
The post-building, which general director John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, finally comes to his previous restructuring, in which 4000 bodies were already lost.
In May, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan for more than 300 million dollars (394 million US dollars) to restore a business that was reached by the quick step to digital learning.
The company who had expressed his contribution to the Bertelsmann partner in Penguin Random House last month said that the view of the business year was unchanged after the first half year had reached a growth of 1% to 2.05 billion pounds.
Konvoi attack by Kabul: Nato Soldat killed in suicide
A self-mortal network has attacked a military convoi in the Afghanistan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of Nato and several other hurt, says the officer.
Five soldiers and a dolmetscher were hurt, divided a clay of the Nato.
Inactive local reports stated that three civilians died in the case of the city of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has met this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a moschee in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide network killed two people near the Iraqic message in Kabul.
In a opinion of Nato, the explosion occurred on Thursday, when a common patrol with the Afghanistan Army was attacked by "improvised speed" by a person.
The statement states that all vulnerable people are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. Military Hospital at the Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group called the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for the NATO groups in the nearby bagram.
According to the United States, in Afghanistan, at least 1,662 civil death victims were in Afghanistan in the first half year of 2017, of which about 20 % were in the capital city.
The end of July killed a self-mortal bomb at least 30 people in a major shit district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had committed this attack.
On 31 May, a violent bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country since the U.S. tribes of 2001 disturbed the Taliban from the power.
The violence underlines the precarious security stages in Afghanistan, since the US President Donald Trump is weakening to increase the number of US troops, military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last weeks, the self-mord deputy in Kabul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their own, and in particular the call by President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA turns a decision on the delay of the rules of complaints
The United States Environment Protector has a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, with the obligation of the States to cover the emissions that cause the emissions, which occurred a day after 15 States complained the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced lately the decision to advance "Ozon conditions 2015" and said that it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we respond to our national partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the view of the EPA that the ozon disorders - in which parts of the country need to be used for damage emissions to determine where the incidences should be made to meet more stricter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 majorly democratic states, together with the district of Cookie, made a complaint on Sunday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has requested to return a wide range of environmental resources that the former President Barack Obama has established as part of a widely larger agenda, which is supposed to cover the economic growth.
However, the efforts have dealt with the democracy and natural protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the breathing of air, which Ozon contains "decrease the lung function and can strengthen the breathing symptoms" such as Astma.
Communicated will Community space
Finally, the decision was clear: In two votes, the Community of Fluorn wine concludes the establishment of a Community ra in the future older plant.
There is an important information before the debate: The purchase contract for the remaining part of the foundation is signed, reported by Master Bernhard Tjaden.
As long as the area in the community belongs to the church community, there is no longer a planning barrier for the project voting by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community resolution.
One of the two investors who are still in the ship has offered to meet the community.
In the earth, he would provide a residence area - approximately 55 square meters - and a limited terrace with 70 square metres of surface for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Communities claim that such a Community space is not as a matching point only for the residents of the older person, but openly in the community.
For example, the word from "Strick Café" made the word.
The decision proposed by the provision of funds for the current budget already in the past inheritance will be rejected by aid opportunities.
The building is located in the sanation area.
The establishment of a Community ra, as reported in Tjaden, would be 60 Pro's ability to promote 30 Pro.
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor that you do not want to throw a knife between the feet in this regard, to conclude that both satellites - which are involved in environmental protection - and Pultdach - which reduces the grass and makes the building economically - would be possible.
Unnecessary, don't only Wilfried Sohmer, if this addition.
If it's helping, he's voting on the body.
It's not so simple in the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to many own buildings with which you do not have the right steps, so you are now rejected at the Community space from the window, she says, "I'm hard to do it."
Yvonne Staiger is prompted for the Community's space, however, absolutely against a communal share.
It sees a covered subvention without any funding or even external investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface, no advantage is given, but is obtained by a real, in doubt, contrary, is the contrary.
The request of Stager to divide the proposal in accordance with the proposal shall be three more for the purposes of the decision.
So there remains two votes in the original programme that Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we take the decision, we make a step to close a rice happiness in our infrastructure."

Rotate in the Harz of Stars to Stars
In Harz, the first "star path" will be found.
This plants the United Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
A planet's road is in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "starway" comes to the need for information of many hard visitors, he said.
He connects nature, Property, movement and sports performance.
Members want to build round tables around the planned and inform the stars and star images.
In a first stage until 2018, the unit "good available installation" plants on five to six places" in the surrounding.
Question Kämen St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, High Geth and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be found on the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receipt plays a role in the location selection.
Moreover, freedom of bar is a criterium.
Later the star path will be extended to move.
"On the star path, the viewers learn much valuable, for example about the physics of the individual stars," said the Unity.
Moreover, they learned why the stars had different colors or why a star was stronger than another, even if it was essentially remote.
It is also provided where the stars are in which the stars are selected and wanted it to be the best to see.
Since 2014, the United Nations has been held in the Montenegro St. Andreasberg, the highest northern Germany.
The locality in the middle of the National Park Harz is based on information from the Federation of Natural Protection of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often, from the milk road and even the Andromeda galaxie with only eye is clear.
Since 2003, in the University, there is something similar to the planned stars - the planet road at the initiative of the Promotion Planetarium Göttingen.
Beginning before Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the inner of our sun system, the planet road leads up to Hainberg and Starwater - and a "external" location in Diemarden (Community Similar) with the Planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets, including the degraded Pluto at the endpoint, are set in the distance and measurement of one to two billion.
The earth is so smoking on a ball of 6,5 millimeter diameters, while the exactly 75 meters away is still missing 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is well four kilometers.
As the sun’s light takes about eight hours to the Pluto, footpassers need a hour to steel with Pluto.
So footsteps are faster than the light in the world.
The March to the next fixster, but it would last a half years.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko first meet, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to put the most stressing box battle in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unsleep World Boxing Council Liftweight Champion, the floor descended to welcome the World Boxing Organization Super-F weight Champion.
After Garcias wins by a single decision on the former four-wide worldmaster Adrien Broner on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds for pound list.

I want you a lot of happiness."
Lomachenko defends his castle against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19 hours on ESPN.
When the couple placed for photos, Lomachenko manager noted Egis Climates that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm an ancient feed weight," reported Garcia.
"I'm grown up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I would like to submit to light weight.
And he must move to light weight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Books need this battle."
Climates asked whether it should be on Pay-per-view, part of a Property that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound depth in this year to agree with Garcia on the next summer (37-0.30 knockouts) who also interested in fighting the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title battle in the forum on 23 September.
"This battle could be located in Pay-per-view mode because all fans asked him," Garcia said and later opened to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "

Fortunas Hoffmann: "Tree chain works better"
Ander Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to the season uptake against Braunschweig that optimization of the disturbance in Aue points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, and with the result, the two opposers would not have been at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"There were two opposers too much, and we need to be more careful in Aue," says the player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The triangle will also be further optimized in the erzgeberg.
And a gate after a free break, the fortunes don't want to be captured anymore.
"For the future it will be so that no one is on the line near Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his community is better accepted by the experiences in preparing with the three chain than with the fourth chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to do in the eye," says his Trayfriedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is safe of his thing, "for we just in the trigger chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can well build," said Hoffmann.
"Profession is, but that we are still better harmonizing and we don't make so many games of mistakes in building."
Of course, Hoffmann also moves to Aue to win the game.
"And if you can talk after an undecision from a missing start, you don't know.
The service might be all right," Hoffmann said.
"If we stand on Sunday with four points and can get on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular seasonal attack."
That's what his tree didn't want to know.
"The start in the season I'm just evaluating after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of a benefit to Aue, only because the game of Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early because of an unweather.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue may even be fresh, because they have no difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a growth favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so 100-proviously where they are," says Fortuna's internal defensor.
Whether the guests from the Rheinland go to the meeting in the final (fast) stadium of Aue as an easier favorite on Sunday.
"It is because we have the claim to come under the first six," says Funkel, whose bi-layer is only positive at a delay against the eye of nine games.
"There is no manship in the 2th Bundesliga, which is needed to be struck from before," said Fortunas Chefcoach.
"And to take such a statement would be arrogant and exciting."
And so Funkel wants his players on Sunday to experience no case.
Published new results of Swedish asylum tests
The latest results of tests for asyl seekers in Sweden, which have been subject to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes the exactity of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicina (Read Medicinal Trade) has started with the implementation of the tests last year.
They should make the age assessment more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration associator (migration report) has been criticized because of errors in the evaluation of the right age of some refugees who were few years old.
To this day, migration act 6.880 has sent testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from Middle March until 31 July 2017.
Eighty Pro(2002) were evaluated as 18 or old, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "perhaps is under 18 years".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the person’s age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson by the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are continuous in the past months.
"We don't see a big distinction in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said in the magazine The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years does not mean that the asylum applicant has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that proposed that the investigated person should be 18 or older.
When the newspaper Svenska Daybladet studied the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old in this year.
The method of medical age evaluation, in the records of wise designs and MRT records of knees, which were then analysed by teeth doctors and radiologs, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endokrinologist Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological rubber of humans to see whether they went before or later than usually through the puberty network.
"I had a reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safe, we should not do as if we could," he said the magazine Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the exactity of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child to be awakened is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is almost under 18, in this case this is about 10 Pro".
Complete in Plan
The work at the three bridges of the country road 108 between Laıbach and Schramberg comes well.
In the middle of the week, a seven tonnes of severe beton was installed on the bridge at the local income of Laıbach.
"We're very good in the time, it's a great way," Reinhold Leicht says, builders at the Roadshot Department and Ver_ in the Government Presidency of Freeburg.
In April, the work started at the same time at all three sanation needed bridges between Schramberg and La’bach.
The building is intended for October, and it is easily sure that the time plan is complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the trombach.
It is a polyprophesy bridge of Beton, dressed with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4,80 metres.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two breasts, it has come throughout the years.
In order to ensure stability and security, the three building works are now highly healthy.
The two other bridges lead over the La’bach.
They're built of red buntsandstein.
Both were created in 1939 and were twelve, respectively 10,60 meters long.
The bridge at the place income of La日bach has now received a width of 1,30 meters on the north side, and seven tons of heavy bridge caps.
This is a border confirmation that will also be used as a operational way.
On the southern side of the bridge, a wide heat of 2,20 meters will be set on Friday.
Then the footstep will go on it.
It is especially that it is a complete part of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two breasts are already covered with the patented bridge caps.
Fixed fingerprints have required the delivery of guides through the building work in Laıbach.
Because there is also a glass box, with which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in the preliminary area of work by handbooks.
The fish and cancers had to be fished before.
For the bridges between the building of the building and the collection wheel in direction of Schramberg, the verb is simply regulated by an ample.
For the building work at the bridge at La ́bacher Ortseang, the street in the area of the bridge is locked at the height of the hotels "tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three breast-feeding are 700 000 euros together.
It will be financed through the country.
AbD in Gerolstein: Bound Protest at German cartoffelsalat
It does not seem so often that parties move to a tragedy, but when it comes about the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, what else is difficult to bring under a hot.
The parties represented in the CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left are part of a wide covenant that shows peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall Rondell is introduced to the "great election campscape".
And names come to the beginning - like Alice Weidel, who is the duo of the spring for the assembly elect on September 24, and the chairman's president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who have been before the beginning of the event will not listen to the afD-learning but demonstrate.
The motto "The eggs remain up."
Originally, the town picknic was planned under the motto "All on a table", but now on the parking place below the Rondells place - and so directly before the eyes of those coming to the afD event in the city Hall.
A bunch of pictures that offer.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the For. A world and one of the major organizations, is very happy: "Too much people have come together here."
There is music and every quantity of foods, including a "urdeutsch cartoffels salat that could also eat the AfD-free," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing presence, especially at the bathroomhof, which is only a few meters away from the events.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulkaneefel that he tried to make such a event and received the advantage.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had asked to do in Daun, but there was a decree because the laurences already built were not enough parking places.
Now the rondell, Hompes, is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
With a view to the event on the roundsite, he says: "This is the right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
It also makes it: 20 a.m. on the Rondell Presidence, a band of entertainment, in the city Hall, various speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfalsic AfD-President Uwe Child.
In the room there are approximately 200 listeners waiting for the candidate for the day choice, Alice Weidel, and the representative of the Federal President Beatrix of Storch to keep their talks.
The police presidence is unchanged, but the officers had even a safe evening.
Some more than one hour the afD event, the guests on the front place have a longer breath, but there has also been indicated cleaning shortly after 21 hours.
The police can stop - no special events.

Christian Stewart is talking about their Bisexuality
"Some people love grassed cakes and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to test everything," so Christian Stewart is very open about his bisexuality.
"If I beat in grasped cups, I think, "Oh, it was cool, what comes next?"
The most famous relationship of Hollywood Star was the one with his "Twilight" colleagues Robert Pattinson, who finally went bitterly out.
Nevertheless, the brilliant representative assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously lost in every one I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After their trend, Christians told that they were bisexual: "I have always kept the dualism and believed it seriously.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
Before it suffered, she said "Bang Showbiz" but at school time, when she preferred to clothe like a bub, "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me that I would look like a bubble.
I felt really attacked, terrified and confusioned.
Now I look back, and I think, "Mankind, be proud of you."
With regard to the public, they don't like to explain their love: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that makes me worse.
And maybe some of me are ungrateful, but I don't like to justify me before the whole public."

Coe lo日 "religious" Russian excuse for Do-Scandal
The world leader of the light athletic, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, what he described as a manifest excuse from Russia to a Do-Scandal, but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport.
Russian Leightathletic Boss Dmitry Shylakhtin, during the IAF Congress, on the earlier night of the Lightathletic World Masterships, said that the curse of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight Do.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes that have been removed from the competition of gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress agreed on the maintenance of the prohibition imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti Do Agency (WADA) found indications on Stately promoted Do® in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAF President Coe said to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized at herself that she has spent some very hot times and will make everything possible to ensure that the federation is rebuilt."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" about accepting Russia's criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very sensitive day, and I think progress has been achieved, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to recover Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The leader was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the devastated system," he added.
Nine of Russian athletes will come to the Lightathletic World Masterships starting on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria as neutral agents.
The leader of the IAF Task Force, Andersen, said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for reinstallation.
The tests remained inadequate and prohibited tragedies still were free, he said reporters in London after a report at the IAAF Council.
Triumph for soldiers ruined in Mali
At a triumph celebration in Northern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two of the soldiers died in Mali.
The ceremonie was located on Thursday in the Domstad under high security preventions.
For an unclear cause of abuse, the Defence Minister Ursula said nothing from the Leyen (CDU).
She covered the two dead pilots, but as "canners of her professionals".
"We decline ourselves from this highest sacrifice they offered in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old and the 47-year-old staff headman from Northern Hessen had come to life on midweek a week ago in Western African Mali.
They were transferred to Germany, and on Thursday, a mortal guard of the Federal War was brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
On midnight, only the members of the church took Abschied.
Afterward, the triumph celebration began in the circle of the family, the closest friends, the representatives of the Federal War, and the.
Hessen's Minister was also President Volker Bouffier (CDU) and General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Sorry guests laid down roses, who were hands in hands on the swergen.
Prior to the church, Fritzlars and many soldiers followed the ceremonie on a lin.
The Defence Minister of the Leyen covered the surrounded soldiers as "hot decorated".
The stabshopper has built the tiger tiger's flight in Fritzlar and was one of the first six tiger pilots of his regime.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Government, who belongs to the soldiers, explained: "If this occupation couldn't turn away the destruction, no one would have been able."
In doubts in the UN mission in Mali, the Minister of Leyen did not show: the use is annual.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are borne only by two states," she said.
After the triumph feast, the swords were brought out of the court.
When and where they are paid, the Federal War did not make any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried near his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be replaced by death beside his wife.
This shared the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish Royal Pair is applied in the Sunday Church of Roskilde.
The imagehauer Björn Nørgaard has already completed a sarkophag for both.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, and she continued in the message.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be still unclean.
But he does not intend to be involved in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a healing because he was not happy with title.
After his wife's throne, Margrethe, in 1972, he would like to become king.
2016 he went into the rest and also put the title "Princemail".
Since Henrik in Denmark had not received the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equal to his wife - neither after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish King House.
Where the last rest of the 83th year will be last, it will be unclean.
But he does not intend to be involved in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has been held in the last 50 years.
The begotten Henri de Laboarde de Monpezat, a son of a French Adels, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
In the theme, he is in the French message.
Since his later wife always made the people's sympathy announcements, Prince Henrik in his nearly 50-year regentship had a serious position in Danish.
In an autobiografie, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was pregnant, I prefered wine ship beer, seed trumpets town stricksocken, citroen loft Volvo, Tennis place football.
Even for the gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia-tabak and the countries had the call to be the mark of socio-critical intellectuals, I could not hope to see.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not shameful.
That was two mistakes!"
Minister because he wants to quickly reelect
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Axes
Mr President Stephan Weil (SPD) under the loss of the red-green majority of the Government for a quick new choice of the country, but he does not want to return.
Since on Friday he spoke for the resolution of the Parliament.
Previously, the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) had caused a surprising outcome of a Green Member from its country-day group in the Netherlands.
Five months before the official date of the country choice, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its nice voting majority in Parliament against the opposition of CDU and FDP.
Previous Green Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in its election circle in Rotenburg (Whee).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
The CDU group leader Börn Thümler wants to recommend his group to stay on them.
The CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Netherlands Landday, SPD and Green 68 seats.
Too long, the relationship was surrounded.
The new country day will be selected regularly on 14 January.
Thumler said that the red-green country government should now decide whether they can continue to rule in this situation without majority.
Stephan Weil, however, believes that it is unexpected that the country day will close its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group will probably decide on Saturday about its further action.
The Constitution also provides the possibility that the country takes the confidence to the President and chooses a follower.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These options must be legally purified," said Thumbler.
"It will be quiet to discuss all questions if they are legally reasonably tested."
Thumler called Twesten's step, but something.
"I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She used herself as an attacher of black-green.
The Green invited the absorptional members to return their landday mandate.
"We, of course, assume that they returned their country-day mandate, which she received over the green country list, with immediate effect," shared the country president Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group president of the Green Anja Piel said, "We suffer the decision of each issue extraordinaryly."
She has decided to not take any exemption in the group.
"And before the background that there were no contentive differences, we can't follow this step."
SPD-Canzlerkandidat Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Netherlands Green Deputy Each Test to the CDU as a tradition.
"The behavior of the former Green Deputy in the Netherlands is not only training to the electors and electors but also to the Red-Green," wrote the Federal Boss of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He underlines the decision of President Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country day.
The outcome Twestens costs the majority of the Red-Green in the Netherlands.
The woman puts "in her damaged poverty and in her fruits their personal interests before the country's welfare," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandale that the CDU in the Lower Axes will be able and trying to kill the political capital."
The CDU group leader Börn Thümler wants to recommend his deputy to stay in the CDU.
The Group Chairman of the SPD in the Bundesday, Thomas Oppermann, proposed to defeat the result of the country choice of 2013 with personal career.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and Green had a high majority of a voice in the landday.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we feel about gifts, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing eggs.
How could the scandal make it?
How the consumers can sing.
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the Redaction Network Germany (RND) talk and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer be able to swim in front of deteriorated eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to see the eggs in your refrigerator and check the pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.life warning.de, the federal countries provide the latest information on the egg loads concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know now, a health danger is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now accept the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the boat - because the central role of the Reveler is not really taken into account by the Federal Ministry of Economy?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Yet, my house has soon been disconnected and has been aware of Germany's concern in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
The trade has to ensure that, as the manufacturers, the manufacturers are able to be transportable and healthy.
If the maximum residue content of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they shall not be transportable.
However, eggs that are unpleasant can be covered and devoted.
This time, the operations are not guilty.
Are productive operators and consumers sitting in the same ship?
According to the current knowledge, the production operators are not eligible directly.
Moreover, they must consider economic damage due to crucial illegal practices of services undertakings.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious case.
Does it miss only to the staff or to the closed responsibilities?
It was just the official controls that have discovered the operation.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100%.
That is why such events are consistent and the transfer to the state advocates in cases where criminals may be sent to a decision.
I have already explained more times that I expect the responsibility of the authorities to have an unfortunate discourse.
Is the regular alarmism really needed in food scandals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain safe and transportable food.
If a non-approval insecticide is placed in the food economy, consumers and consumers are legally affected.
The retailed resources include manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
Basically, it must be clear that the legal use of insecticid Fipronil in the holding of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be immediately finished.
This must be consequently performed at all levels and with high pressure.
I hope of all competent authorities that the business content will be revealed with adequately and unfortunately.
How football financial rules affect Neymar's movement to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unprecedented vessels of football verbs will not be used by Neymars Weltrekord Transfers from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come from the EUFA to Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization who has monitored the game has the power to prohibit the access to the prestigious Champions-League tours.
Financial Fair-Play rules invited by the EUFA in 2011 mean that PSG once must prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilians outside the contract, and Neymar will receive a content which will be acquired several ≥ million per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's turn to France.
PSG can safely make the money locker to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxie of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the rich guest family of Katar through energy.
Ones can use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they must resist with legitimate income sources that enable them to Break-Even point in their business on the football.
FFP was allowed by Michel Platini after his choice to EUFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that the units who had taken great debt in their efforts after success were effective and risked to ruin when banks or owners returned their support.
In 2011, FFP from the consolidation to the obligations of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change indicated that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - purchased a potential club and then invested strongly to improve the mastership and to build a global mark - should be a stronger matter.
Within the current three-year FFP investment period running up to 2018, Club losses may take EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen in Ungnade by the Presidency 2015, its EUFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare from excessive deficiencies.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for FFP in the EUFA, against the FFP Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buyout Class of Neymar in a pauschale, it can distribute the amount of accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has undergone a five-year contract so that the sum of resolution for the next five years can be determined by 44.4 million euros in the annual end.
The first wall of FFP sanctions in 2014 met the PSG with Abu Dhabi, who is in possession of Manchester City, with the most serious sanctions.
The PSG received a money penalty of 60 million euros (for example 82 million euros), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was assigned that the company members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 to 21 players are limited to the other normal 25 players.
The EUFA is looking for clubs that may try to overlist their financial oversight by providing their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.
In currency of a cataretical company, the PSG could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the EUFA would not allow this to be considered legal income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when EUFA discovered that the value of the PSA sponsorings was revealed by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG figures in Neymar could come into Katar by payments of the WM 2022 organisational commit.
But PSG and Katar 2022 have decided that Neymar becomes WM boots and can simply find such a manöver for EUFA regulatory staff.
Previous sanctions against PSG indicate that EUFA will be more careful to take care of any attempt to implement the rules.
The EUFA had no preparing conversations with PSG on Neymars Transfers on Thursday, said the people trusted in the situation.
They spoke under the conditions of the anonymity with the 'Press' because they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has gained more than 10 million euros with a total of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last business year must be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and tricot sales.
The agreement concludes that the turnover will increase by at least 30% after the signature.
The Spanish Liga was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's journey by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial Do" with the club and the state," said President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish AS journal on Katars, a PSG ownership.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose union is owned by a sport Ticoon, shares the preservations of La Liga against a State financing a unit.
"It is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the football in the last 15 years," winger said on Thursday.
"Soon as a country is a unit, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is searching for a new shoggy provider
In the past years, chocolat Frey Board chocolate has produced for the Swiss.
Now the sixth cooperation is before a possible end: the flight company rewrites the mandate.
Swiss-Ssprecherin Meike Fuhlrott visited a corresponding report from Friday of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland".
With the current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year 2018.
The products would be checked both two and three years and undergoing a quality check.
"We are very satisfied with the current chocolat Frey supplier," said the speaker.
17 million small red wheat packaging shoggy tables to 14 grams per year distribute the flight members before landing to passengers.
The Switzerland wouldn't make information about the costs.
Branchen insides appreciate the volume of the mission "Norwest Sweden" at 1.5 to 2 million Franks - the Micros daughter has an annual sum of around a billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a shog manufacturer it is a prestigious task.
How many applicants there is in the new statement, the Swiss doesn't want to deliver.
However, only Switzerland producers come in question.
According to the magazine report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive forward to the renewal of the Treaty on the March 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a opinion.
Shokolade tables have distributed the Swiss since 2006 on the board of their flights.
Before the Swiss concluded an agreement with Micro's daughter, Barry Callebuut had delivered the chocolate tables in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo, Swiss introduced two and half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The flight company is together with different Swiss chocolate products.
On long-term flights, the customers of the first class are exhausted from the configation Sprüngli, in the Business Class Nash Passages Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short line Swiss Schoggi distributes Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Easy athletic - Discussion olympics Robert Harting reached WM-Finale
The three-year world master fights a medaille on Saturday at the end.
His brother Christoph, Olympian of 2016, failed in the national WM divorce and could only look at the discourse fight by the tribe.
Similarly, with the first trial, the Poland Title Defensor of Malachowski, who cast 65.13 meters along, was for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detectives" in the neck
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80s, for the 90-year-old-Gahre-Era (as David Wain and Michael Showalter drew the Skee-Comodia "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that means for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.
As a cultural artefact, it is also a parodia and a body of our Facebook ears of permanent reminders.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time wouldn't be.
"First Day of Camp" worked well, not only because of his absurd humor (he contained an original story for a speaking dose of trees spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By understanding on the corner of the gags - middle-aged viewers play a lot of children that will be raised - they made the unable to win the last part of the crazy.
"The Years Later", with his awake, who now play awakened, is less emotionally wounded and his parody goes more after the chicken prince, including a riff on the stalk films of the 90s, such as "The Hand That Rocks the ́dle" ("The hand that looks on the wheel").
On a point, a character is broken through a Apple Powerbook, some inline scates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Property of the central stories are the same.
The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman日, Katie (Marguerite Moreau) has not yet forgotten.
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there is another foolish-bush place, which is included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-capable impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excurses are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons sublindered by "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old kidney.
It's the moments of accidental disappointment that could touch this franchise like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" Serie until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands as she will visit the film-impressors of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: to the rebuilding of the cold war by "The Americans", to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its east-gegen-western Ring battle iconography.
The commodity created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a register indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighteen years with the two cops as friends, two officiers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxismus linenism.
The main roles - a very sweet Gregor and a idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a exporting product) and Joseph Gordon Levit are synchronized in English.
It's a genius idea.
But it's not much more than a idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look (the police spent the time to see the shack in television how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a famous game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so involved in the reality of a suspicious propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a reagan mask will be included - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes it moves to it, and the commodity is not quick or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited at a lower length, could best provide his Agitprop satiers, since Gregor and Joseph always visit the else message, whose lobby is always occupied by two deep men who burn a lot of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist public is that western culture can make everything to feed for a facility.
The ficticial Roman Creators do not wrong: we do it even with our younger story and its own.
Battle against Mafia in the country
The police is a fight against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
At midnight, in the Black Wald-Bar-Creis, in Rottweil, Constanty, Eating and Stuttgart, many objects were searched, as the State Advocate communicated constantly on Friday.
15 accused of age between 25 and 77 years have been arrested and already adopted an order against them.
The officers made more marihuana and cocaine, shooting weapons, and more than a hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in timely races in Italy.
In contrast to the two suspicious Italians there was a German arrest order.
The two are therefore supplied to Germany.
The action was participated by Italian and Bayer investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were used.
The members of Mafia are subject to organized criminality, severe violence, injured murder, and rape and pressure.
Since summer 2016, the State Advocate has detected constantness against the organized trade in the southern German room.
Among the state advocates in Constante and Palermo was a government exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost every day contact with their colleagues to Sicilia.
Therefore, the big appointment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on midweight.
In view of the investigations, Italian citizens were particularly referring to the Italian mafia.
Even a incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, when several shooting in a guesthouse were thrown in the morning morning, it should go to the account of the bands.
Mode of complaints with great lusts in the foreign government
"Data of citizens that should not occur": According to a report, the foreign Governor in Germany has dealt with significant deficiencies.
This leads to partially serious failure decisions in asylum procedures.
The mandate for the management of refugees of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen, has made a media report note of big places in the foreign central government.
Manufacture of data registered there could lead to "too-particular failure decisions" in the case of asylum procedures and divisions, warned in an analysis of the "South German magazine".
According to the Governor, the information is included in millions of people with foreign nationality, including approximately 5.7 million of non-EU States.
The data will then be managed by approximately 600 strangers in Germany.
Because the data were not sufficiently collected, the data quality was not good in parts until now.
In individual cases, data were found in 1921, "after people who are not longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not take place in the Register."
"Incorrect data may be significantly slow back processes," follows the report.
Statistics on travellers also include EU citizens who do not need to go out.
However, such false arrangements led "to a corrupt debate on the trafficking with the outcome obligation", it states in the analysis.
Instead, the Federal Government has evidently started to resume the family of refugees with under 16-year-old children to Italy when they are entered in there.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Federal of Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Journal".
The paper says that the BAMF has taken such procedures "without children - except children and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it was practically not possible, so the magazine is linked to the difficult situation in front of the place.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU State are responsible for their first delivery.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State can return to the country of entry.
For reason, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the ability to take into account families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has granted guarantees for the collection and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (EGMR) considers that these obligations are sufficient.
In addition to other EU countries, refugees would return to Dublin Agreement.
The interpolitical speaker of the Left Group in the Bundesday, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threatened because of the lack of the Italian asylum system of human rights and a threat to child choice."
Second result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in the surface bach has already been available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens issued on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, dividing with his 100 S · between 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community at the meeting of the Community appreciates the multi-fold preparation for blood.
"It's genial how our body has been created for it and we will give the donors respect that provides their blood for foreigners, even inutile for it," emphasized citizen Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood spending helps several people," stated the Dutch Red Cross Leader, Holger Meat Bacher, because the conserves are replaced in their components.
Three people could have benefited from a blood-spread.
At the same time, meat bakers reported of the actions carried out in the early year in the Superior Bach.
"In this year, we achieved the second best result with 114 spenders," said the DKC Cruise Preparation Leader.
Obviously, the exchange to the theater house has led a number of years ago to participate.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Richle, Sandra Schock, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umber were counted to the multi-spenders and were exhausted for every 50 blood.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter was delivered for 500 milliards of their lives.
The Bank of England will keep the rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England will probably subsequently indicate that the price rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakness of inflation has decreased the speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that the economic growth will remain "drag" when it maintains the rate of income in the middle of a strengthening pressure.
The political decisionmakers of the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain the rates of 0.25%, while less members in this month tried to increase, since the weak economic growth has reduced support for increase.
In its fourth-year inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure would continue on the budget income, which would probably increase the inflation in the middle of 2017 to approximately 3 %.
But she signaled that in the next years, interest increases would be needed to decrease the inflation defected by Brexit and she said that the credits may be more than expected to increase on the financial markets.
The members also agreed to remove a part of the Mammut conjuncture package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will request time for the funding plan to provide more money for banks from February coming, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide more than 15 billion pounds in this system - with 115 billion pounds of pounds.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rates, the Bank said: "In the central prevision of the MPC, the Brutto-Inland product (BIP) remains short-term weak, since the pressure on the real income of the budget continues to be charged with consumption."
In the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain penalty of money policy" would be necessary to cold the inflation and a "better" measure than the markets expected.
The markets currently prognoze the first increase in the next quarter of the year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank emphasised that increases would be "steply" and "limited".
The adjusted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and the next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% prognosed in May.
She maintained its growth predicts at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound falls after these messages to the euro and to the euro.
The pound falls by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and falls by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision shall not be amended after the latest deteriorating growth rates have decreased the increased expectations of interest increase and the BDP has increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months in the second quarter of 0.2 %.
The growth will probably be 0.3% in the quarter, although it will be easily recovered by the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little pleasure for households affected by an increased inflation and low-containment increases, since the deterioration becomes even worse before it gets improved.
They will conclude that the money policy will not be able to prevent income breaks in the next years, but they will be able to add the salaries to the end of their three-year prognoses.
The economy is also strengthened by the increased request for British goods, which results in the weak pound, which will contribute to a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the decrease of the price rates to 0.25% in August last after the shocking EU vote that caused the incidence of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until the prices and the economy are completely achieved.
Before the last sentence of the Bank to the interest rates, the call was decreased after an increase in interest, since the inflation increased the pressure on severely deteriorated budgets, and three political decision-making decisions requested an increase to 0.5% in July.
The inflation was decreased by 2.9% in June to 2.6% in the past month, although the Bank said that it was expected and that it would be revoked in the next months.
The Bank said that the oversight of its goal of 2 % would be "gant" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "As regard of the recent retreat of the Swap Councils, the hypothecs should be more competitive, since the creditors are looking for business and wanting to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks especially good for those who have the current shares and finish the new hypoteques, and many with free options and low advice will always be popular."
NHS (National Health Service) should prescribe controversial HIV drugs 10,000 people
Patients will be received from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in NHS to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England reported that a pre-exposition prophylax (PrEP) which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86%, now the health service provides for a first three-year study for estimated 100,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the Court of Procedure in the past year had approved a judgment of the Master Court of Justice, whereas the NHS had the power to charge the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should financ it.
The shock train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS English Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) was "determining moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will belong to the first ones that will be enabled to register people, and other clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced in full England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylax (PrEP) is a result of HIV medicines used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Others have shown that PrEP has significantly reduced HIV transmission in infectious patients.
Taking PrEP before sexual traffic means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken daily or at least two hours before sexual traffic.
Those in question for treatment belong to smuggles or bi-exual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-related partners who have not been treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree with the same, men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered in a householder can also be reported for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be subjected to £10 million and NHS England a treaty on the delivery of medicines this week after international competitive acquisition.
This shall evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by collecting and implementing clinical claims, as intended to be used in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This large new intervention should complement and overcome the broad and continuous efforts to prevent HIV.
It is a further milenstein in the more than three years of sustainable progress in the promotion of one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decided moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when it is intended to be addressed to the needed and demanded people, provides the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is actually controlled individually, not with a negotiation with a partner, which leads to improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be pointed out that it will be performed quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left back.
Now since the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we're on the best way to sing more than 10,000 HIV-inquired people."
Sharon Hodgson, the Ministry of Shadow Health, said: "The beginning of the PreEP process is welcome and overcome after monthly delays and subsequent implementation by the Government.
The evidence shows how transforming this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life changed infection.
This trial brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that these areas are carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to make people who are HIV-inhaled, and that they will contribute to the end of HIV spread in society.
The big life: Intersect and smart designer-Tʹks have converted this small Earls Court apartment into a great house
Joanne Leigh, an ancient banker with a suffering for immobility, moved from a large house in Knightsbri to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is in the first stone of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it is a evidence of the new design that Joanne has not packed and packed his bags.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbri," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court, and she had the same high cover.
I have made a ship in her and made a ship on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overcome.
Originally a room-in-layout with a shooted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bed room - Joanne wanted to add stauraum and a crowd to use the great covering height optimal.
"I wanted high cover, big windows, many lights.
That was my request," she said.
For this purpose, she ordered the architecture and design study Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high cover and create a house that was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne.
The deck was not great enough to place two spaces over each other so that the textonic challenge was to create a middle-shot in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel work is pretty complicated," he said.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were shot on each other without we had to buy ourselves.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled herfan to place two spaces in full height over one another - with a lot of extraordinary drama.
For the cross-border, a classic copper light window of Retrovuius looks down over the glamourous residence area.
Reflected gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mo日 Lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, room and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is reflected to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the input, reflected units offer a place for all the beaches and glasses of Joanne.
The beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combinable kitchens are nothing new.
The point of this is that it is a garage.
"A little engineer art went in there," Erfan stated by the steel-forced, furnished MDF door.
"It's opposite, so when you move the door up, it's very easily glacial."
Thanks to the smart use of room and stauraum, Joanne was able to win 16 m2 later, an additional sleeping room and a improved layout.
"After the end of the day, you will reap the base area - or how your immobility is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a roudimentary form, an immobile maker will enter into and carry out a depth based on the ground size."
Here they have been able to increase the ground area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that make the room its luxurious benefit.
"The materials are the things you touch and thus help create a emotional connection in a house," says Erfan.
"You don't love the electric sticks in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed through design and increased square metres from something standardly into something very surprising.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not leave them.
Brothers fighted for a $500 million Immobiliary Empire
Two brothers are four years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a discharge due to one of the largest Immobiliary Empires Victorias valued over 500 million.
The former director of the "Carlton-Fotball Club" and Developer Colin De Lutis le日 in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from a younger brother Paul. This brought him to the Master Court of Justice to clothe their ownership and business powers.
Paul wanted to get away from the family service since 2014, but a strict deal on the trend has been located in the Master Court of Justice.
With their mother, the brothers have 38 immobilies in the value of more than half billion, collected since 1973 the family bought a business in the ownith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family was founded and grew up to a category of 160 individual businesses.
It was charged in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and the Portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and the purchases in the pre-town.
After a agreement with his devastated father, Colin - by Paul as "Main Manufacturer and the dominant personality" described in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company power and Paul about one third.
A Court states that this means that Colin ownership in value of 316 million and Paul in value of 176 million.
The division of real estate and bars has been shown to Paul as a problem point.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failures, the first consultation of the Master Court of Justice was found.
The brothers have also fought about the control of the existing business, which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded.
Colin arguments that this is not true, but proposes Paul to manage some possessions incompatiblely.
In an early affidavit, which was presented by Colin, he says he hopes to join the fight.
"My Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including deloittes, Pitcher partners and Charter Keck'mer, and with leading legal advocates, including Allan Myers, QC, and both pages of advocate facilities.
Mrs. De Lutis and her devastated husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who conducted milkbars and delicate businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventy years.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood liability, in which Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (approximately 10 years old)".
De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property pleasantly to their sons.
"Lugi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Business Group, and Colin claims that the market was paid by 10 million and Luke 26 million.
If Lucas and Mark are, Paul says, "without the conditions of their financial trend were disappointed."
Colin was very back, although he was an ancient AFL representative member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their advocates.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say, "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and drag our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the midst of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to comply with his brother's requests.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to end in our current fight," he said and said, "he'd always hope for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our business will be solved by the courts in the near future," said Colin.
Trumps, a new staff boss, plants to cover the media abstention of the president.
Others have tried it and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it really.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new boss of the White House plants to bear the information flow on President Trump - in the reports of the media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more balanced course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new boss of the White House, met with leading employees on the first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should be flowed - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he had received information."
Kelly diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to cut Trump by watching his media device.
President Trump's relationship with television has been back enough years - and now where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.
"If Kandidat Trump was enraged because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a correct reporting of offices that were to be convinced," said the former electoral council Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter's habit under control, according to six former election officers, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a permanent lobby price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something that we don't know else -- that Trumps Tweets without their interventions would have contained more fuel.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that the Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees had been able to keep hard from him sometimes, their efforts were rewarded.
But no one could prevent it consequently from calling Trump conflicts.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house that is combined from competitive parties are always trying to predict their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may promote their views of the world.
Politico, who is entirely occupied with this story, reported in May about the pleasure of the advisers to make the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officers say that Trump can react as a Vulcan to negative press exhibitions, especially with protective leaks, and that he understands where they are.
That was the end of February, when somebody had a badly printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the webprovocator Charles C. Johnson, who charged the chairman Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a crowd of Lecks" in the white house.
Although Johnson has been forgotten permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false intentions in the past and has rejected it.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker also adds that the former staff officer Reince Priebus and the white House's Secretary-General, Rob Porter, "sucked to implement a system to manage and documentate the paper frame, receive the Trump".
How'd that go?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive to influence.
These unchanged ones make Kelly mission very difficult.
Most seeking criminals received post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be prayed and hoped.
The police throughout Europe sends postcards in this summer (virtual) on annual crimes on the flight.
Since the addresses of the searched severe crimes are not naturally, indications from the population are expected and suppressed.
Europol reported on Friday of the action followed by the EU Most Wanted advent calendar from the winter.
The experiences had shown that many flighters were hidden at vacation destin, named Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed, more than 2.5 million times.
36 online discussions could be captured until now, at least 11 of them on the basis of indications after the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate about a grave and return to 'Millionary Riches'
Some of the most prodigious householders in West Midlands are back with some deceived travellers, who have negotiated one of the graves of the community to require a field before their masters.
The travelers have parked their 20 cars on a field outside a well-hashing street of Solichull, called the "millionary roads".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were released in May, but they were feared by one buried by the Council to prevent their income.
The tactful group found a bullet in the defence facilities and assembled their vehicles through a section that remained inevitably in order to find a way.
Devastating inhabitants threatened the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "unusual to consider the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "You have been guarded on Montagabed Dorthin after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they have made stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement, since he was unusual in the face of the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were moved and are back now.
More came last night, probably more today."
She adds: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long teachings to shalt their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community taxes if the Council can't stop it even."
A resident who would not be called said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last one of these travelers just to be planned by another.
The numbers have grown up this time, and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
One speaker of the Council of Solihull said: "We are conscious of an unemployed camp in the country on the side of the Street Brook Road and work together with the Police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
To submit our evidence collection, it is very important that many inhabitants, as far as possible, report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine, where we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof, the forest hotel will be Luise.
The house before the gates of joy city is currently renewed and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
These are news for the city.
Because by closing the hotel Birkenhof by the early Environment Company mbH until 13 April 2014, some 30 000 overnights per year were lost and also income by the curtax.
In the midst of 2014, a dramatic increased number of refugees in the country circle offered the hotel building to the Agricultural Council as a collective accommodation, which provided for conflicting discussions.
The city prevented the transfer of asylum applicants by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was at that time not unconflicted in the Community.
But especially in the city of joy, the top citizen Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested people at the house.
He should keep right.
The Luisen Hotels group with Business Leader Birgit Scheren with Sitz in Bad Bergzabern has the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary exhibition in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star-Plus category called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyful object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You're called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Park Hotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
In the previous hotel Birkenhof, Bauschutt container has already been a long time before the entrance, and when you arrive in the house, it will be clearly performed a large renovation work.
The ships were exhausted, covered to part, removed old bathroom wheels from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is one only building place.
There's much to do until March.
"It's a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our magazine.
Everything will be renewed in blackwall style.
The rooms are equipped with big favorable dusts, which is transformed into the input area, and new windows are built.
Everything will be "good citizens" afterwards, as Thomas Scher.
"We want to make a nice piece."
Swimbad, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the payment.
You don't want to place yourself at the high level of hotels in La′bad, but at a high level of inner town, sheer.
The wooden hotel Louise with his about 60 rooms wants to be wide, continues to make a screen.
Such individual accommodators, groups or businessmen are to feel in the hotel.
Speaking with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, he has already conducted, as he is.
The views of the city are covering with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
At the height of investments, Thomas Scher does not want to determine exactly.
Button under a million euros, he calculates.
In addition, the external facilities are brought to the frontman, that is already clearly visible.
In an internal hof there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the public aurant.
Thomas Scheren is optimistic: "Freuden City is a good market."
Russian Affairs: U.S. Specialists set Grand Jury in
In the Russian Affairs on the US President Donald Trump, the Special Minister Robert Mueller would have put a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The committee took the job in the past weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal under vocational vocation to people trusted in things.
The magazine assessed the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his research.
The sender CNN reported that there were already the first invitations of the Gremi in relation to a meeting between the oldest son of Trump and a Russian advocate.
US secret services have accused the creml since longer to have been mixed in the Presidency Champion 2016.
Mueller examines whether there was a decline between Trumps' election campaign and Moscow.
In the focus of research, several men who acted in the election battle as the adviser of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps in the private and business environment under the lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediterranean Trump personally took the center and examined the proposal whether the president might have interrupted justice in the course of business.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine previous evidence in possible crimes and to decide whether accusations are to be raised.
Grand Jurys is therefore also called claim rooms.
In fact, they will be enabled if it is greater and contraverse cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The Board can also be enabled by the Governing Board in order to offer persons to be approved under an oath.
According to the CNN sender, there have already been charges that turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian advocate.
Persons participating in the meeting were invited to a statement, it was mentioned in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps advisers and sons of Sweeger Jared Kushner and his college boss Paul Manafort were at the talk.
Justice experts said on Thursday in the U.S. TV that the establishment shows that Mueller is not allowed to be involved in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury is finally enabled to decide on the exhibition of a complaint.
However, the establishment of the Gremio of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Trump.
In the midst of the new enthings, the President used a talk in Western Virginia to represent Russian business as a campaign for his political opposers.
"The Russian history is a total finding," Trump said.
The subject gives the democracy a chance to "found me well because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
However, it was usually working in secrets, he stressed.
The White House had any measures which accelerated the work of the special mediator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI Chairman James Comey said three times that it would not be detected against the president.
There is no reason that it has changed something, it has continued to be said in the Revelation.
But Mueller was used first after Trump Comey had earned.
Because of this output, prejudices against Trump became sound, he wanted to prevent justice.
Comey said in June before a session committee, Trump asked him for a position of investigations against the recent national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After presenting US media, the white house collected material against the special mediator and his employees.
The speculed speculate explains whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
In contrast with an independent specialist of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affairs about the later returned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically addressed on the forces of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Many Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented on Thursday draft legislation, which would not be so easy for the special mediator to be released.
Antarctic: Gigantical Eisberg 3′ in the Antarctica
In the Western Arctic, a huge iceberg has been solved from the nearly sevenfold size of Berlin from the shelf.
This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research in the middle of the week.
The billion tonnes heavy and 500 square kilometers big coloss now moves to north, and it will take two, three years until it is mosqued.
It is 175 km long and a width of up to 50 km one of the largest ice-gigants registered by researchers in the past three years.
It doesn't come out of him.
As long as the climate change has played a role in the breaking of the iceberg, research is unclean.
However, over 30 years a series of unusual iron combinations in the region, the US research room for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a background.
Many researchers think that it can be associated with the heating.
The now cancelled coloss was a part of Larsen-C-shelf.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is split by great glasses.
So it continues to be in the sea and breaks regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is almost southern South America at the top of the Antarctic Halbins.
On the north of this festival, the balance of growth and cancellation was deteriorated a few years ago.
A complete floor is fallen there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks about some things that the Larsen-C-shelfeis is also in , because the previous border has never returned as far as the current.
Furthermore, the iron plates are under spending and can be cut off if a piece is broken at a key place.
The smelting of shelfeis and iceberg doesn't increase the sea level, since it flows on the water and swims ice as much water as it does after the smiling itself.
However, the loss of the chest leads to that the glaciers are directly moving into the sea and can flee much more faster than before.
This could increase the sea level, however, only in a small way, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Shelfeis is the fourth size of the Antarctica, according to AWI information, with almost 50 000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the festival, it is up to 700 meters dick, at the front side of the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iron is now coming into a better position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea.
"This is the widest backward since the records began," he also acted.
Under-Communities should be contrary to whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or return long-termly and may be combined, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will last a year.
Even if these researchers don't bring this giant icebergs back to climate changes, many iron sheets of the Antarctic Halbins have fallen in the past year.
This long cipher of the Antarctica is stretched to South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the iron area of the Antarctic Halbinsel has returned 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
To decline, the temperature increase has reached.
The Antarctic Halbinsel has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, and it counts on the areas in which the temperature grows fastest.
CDU wants home tariff for personal
Since it is always more difficult to occupy free places, the CDU calls to get out of the worker connection to become more attractive.
Shortly before the summer pause, the cross-border has overcome 41 new bodies in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officers work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainers have their first working day behind them again.
The teachers at the circuit are apparently very desired.
620 applications were to be forwarded for the places that were to be delivered in this year.
Nevertheless, there is no staff in the circle to be able to determine the required requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are 50 places that are not occupied in the Circle Mettmann.
Inter alia, doctors and engineers, as well as the powers of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG in the cross-border and face the lack of experts in the administration.
The administration will, according to the wish of the parties, "build a concept of staff acquisition and personal development".
The objective is not only to cover short-term needs of experts, but is to respond to the future orientation of the deficiency of the applicant.
The general concept should be guided inside and outside, set up specific measures for increasers and included a training open, requesting CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's what it's hearing after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with personal problems that you did not know before.
Other towns cast off officers and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a regular "concurrence of the public employee".
This is a high number of employees that separate disease or older conditions from the service.
The maximum time for action so that no more places remain unemployed.
However, Klaus-Dieter People, the group head of the CDU, is still over the common request with his party.
He has recently provided a fascinating surprise in the cross, when he has made a public question of staff dealing with the rest of the parties.
The people wish to check all possibilities that allow outcome from the municipal workers' association.
"If we don't come here shortly to a satisfying solution, the circuit administration with the communities - maybe also in cooperation with circle cities - should strive to make a home tariff," as the people.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officers better than the provision of the tariff scheme for the public service.
The containers are currently written exactly, increasing or more money is only if you change into a strict level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have continued to be increased in the past years.
Just a few weeks ago, new spaces were needed to be established in which employees should take care of the provisions of the new Prostituted Protection Act.
Not recently: by the increased number of asylum applicants, the country Council Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Judger have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy strengthens the sound to NGO migrant ships
Italian NGOs, used the ship of salvation for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not keep new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new behavior code, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Marco Min in an interview with the tour of the Daily Journal La Stampa.
Min's warning came on a day after the Italian authorities had arrested a boat of the German Aid Organization for Youth Saving, because their community had effectively joined human traders in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration.
The Aid Organization, which has been in operation for the first one year, refused to express its opinion on the executive purposes of the Italian State lawyer Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us is and remains the salvation of human life our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and salvation area," said the organization in a opinion on social media.
"We can evaluate all the accusations that are currently being charged only after we have collected all information and can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities have monitored the ship of 'Young Rettet', the Iuventa since October.
It is assumed that his occupation takes a ship of ship ship migrants which are directly delivered by human traders, and that the ships can go away so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the State lawyer's act, whose content was published by Italian media.
The emphasis will be suspicioned to oversee the authority of the Italian Coast Watch, the salvation units in the area for humanitary reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the behavior code, boats such as the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board watching their A.
Only three of the nine NGOs shared in search and salvation units have been ready to keep the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Lastly, on Thursday, the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, because they would not bring to themselves "essential changes or obstacles" of their salvation action.
Among those who refuse to submit themselves, the Nobel Price Organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
In the meantime, the number of migrants arrived in Italy in the last weeks, which suggested that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with the local citizens' fruits.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He has made plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to achieve Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berliner foreign posts" and two guest drivers met in the Watchenheim in the North Pool to enjoy trials and visions for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for them.
The accommodation in the Watchheimer valley was a good starting point for tours.
The bourg and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to Michaelcalls above Deidesheim at warm summer temperatures near the winebergs.
It followed viewpoints, partially on the doors, from which you could look far over the Pfalzer forest and the preliminary levels.
Among them, there were still longer advances, rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to saline and to Volksfest Wrest.
Respective lookpoint, connected with "flow" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many height meters were re-determined.
Hills, rocks, tours,bourges, ruins and a household welcome pauses.
In Bad Dürkheim, the cars breathe in the free air inhalation.
Even Newstadt was refused.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 height meters, the group had known the Pfalzer forest from his best - sport and cultural side.
Konsole  slot Rasen - Bundesliga for e-sports
Do the sport stars sit futurely before computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium races in wind and weather?
It is: E-sport is longer to a severe breach, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and large tours with high gains including.
This has also been recognized by the first federal corporations that continue to be involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04, and later the VfB Stuttgart, the middle of July, founded a E-Sport Division and took two Professors for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to enjoy a completely new young target group for the VFB," says Jochen Rootgermann.
He's sure that on this train there are more units.
On the next week, the football worldwide band FIFA organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the players of various clubs arrive.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Endhoven.
Robin Dutt also sees a great potential in the e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen, inter alia, consults an agency for football players.
"The real football must be separated in particular with the 14-30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says 52-year-old.
And: The units tried to obtain all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent e-sporters under the contract, you could be more online than sending the federal body to Asia only once a year.
What's exactly going on?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the FIFA football simulation will be exploded at competitive levels.
As in the normal sport, they have set up the lines in which the professionals attack each other.
And in the 2022 Asian games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a right sport?
For many, the idea is safely needed to be used.
Ingo Froboose has also seen the question for a long time.
For the Professor at the German Sporthoch School in Köln, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in the classic sport - for example increased heart frequency, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
○ Cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactionability needs.
Professional players should not only train at the console but also train their body and take care of the nutrition.
"The fat player is a good player."
Frobisy also sees problems: "Do will always be a more topic."
Controls were difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing.
Positively, the creatives have the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
The players are internationally on the road, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural inhibitions.
A series of business advice Deloitte and the Federal Interactive Training Software (BU) provides for the E-sport a racial growth.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.
In three years, the turnover will be at 130 million.
In contrast to the nearly 2,4 billion euros of the football boundslig, it is little.
However, the e-sport is "no longer from the other established sports, such as handball, basketball or Eishockey," writes the Deloitte bars.
There are many countries still.
Great markets are Asia and the United States, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseball Star Alex Rodriguez share in the US NRG team eSports.
Hollywood School player Ashton Kutcher is invested in the eSport Legal Offer One.
In Europe, there are some things.
In a Norwegian school, E-sports have been introduced as educational staff, Frobiose says.
In the Netherlands and France, the football firstliga units have been committed to establish a E-sport Department.
"In the comparison, Germany is behind," states VfB-President Rootgermann.
Only falling in Nostalgia, and explaining the old times, there is no longer enough today.
It is to keep the tradition of the United Nations, but to place the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt, too.
"It can't be able to keep that only in the football everything remains like it was always."
Gift owner ade - The egg alternatives for kitchen and bathroom
In the meantime, by the scandal for gifted eggs, almost all countries are affected.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are not evidently contain fipronil should be taken in the regulations.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that cause Conrad Roy to kill himself
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two or half years because she urged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be sentenced 15 months behind the grids and five years have been exposed to the chair.
Carter was condemned in June because of the carrier killed by Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing, "My family is unfortunate.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was able to stay free until he was calling.
She was confronted with a 20-year-old higher penalty, but her legal representatives argued that both Mr. Roy and Mr. Roy had a mental disease.
It was dressed in red hairs and a creme coloured blue, carter stood there with trees in the eyes, with old hands and lower-oriented eyes when it was condemned.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the State advisor said to the Court.
" she ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken a responsibility," she said.
" She hasn't shown any repentance."
But Carter's legal lawyer said that it was a "terrible circumstances that they're totally suffering."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he didn't find out that her "alerge or reefgrade or even their spirit disease has significant influence on their actions".
A state lawyer read a claim of Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day I don't care about the loss of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I go about everything. I try to be there, despite all my pain that we will be with us for ever, for his sisters," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never share in her brother's wedding or would be a tattoo for his children.
"No more to have this only person with which I was together since my birth every day, is a pain that I will always keep with me for my life."
The case seems to have a legal case of presidency because there is no law in Massachusetts that causes a crime to invite another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found to be found by a carbon monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case took national attention after Carter's text communications enthusiasm that she had encouraged him to finish his life.
"Stop up, get out of a building, start yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent death in the two weeks ago while he was with his family in the vacation.
At the moments before self-mord she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is to enable the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered it to benefit from any pressure from the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
The few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was condemned in 2007 for murder at its British conviction in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lahm of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was able to run on Audi Cup as Captain is not a case.
The FC Bayern trusted the Confed Cup Seager a great season - Extra-motivation does not damage there.
Something was different in the cabine, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the added dressing piece was very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, wasn't Philipp Lahm and wasn't a new manuel, he made the link assigned to him to his arm.
"The Tray hasn't announced it," said the Confed Cup cigarette behind, after the first use of the Bayern Captain.
Well, the position could be better run than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the coach could also mean that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as player in the player from youths, debutants and just from vacation C-Elf Professor, but he.
The most loved sugar is distributed to those who are much trusted to keep on payment.
So who has been chosen to reach the inheritance of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
"This is what you want as player: take responsibility."
In the middle of the 22-year-old flood as a mini-lahm over the field.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white bond on the arm made her left.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this starting form as the one who can take the ruder in the best hand.
He gave instructions, trying to lift the unintrodusted troops.
He had the corner for all, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overcome his faultless fitness (founded short); Renato Sanches to join the devil to the service of Asian travel (scapped only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not be negative in their first entrance in the Bayer Trikot.
It always worked well.
Süle walked near Kimmich, Rudy before the department, both acted sovereign.
The deeply occupied Napoli storm often became difficult, and the sulls also tried to build a few times in the game.
Although his colleague Rudy said that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a regular performance in the debt.
Game inflation, Tempo Change: "For this style I was also obtained."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for new access, you were seen in connection with the party.
For example, Rudy gave not one or two in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich declined after a few shocking statements in his new player's back.
There he heard a interesting statement of Sule: "What happened here, I've already seen.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
He never needs to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivated UFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our UFB ladies
The most Austrian footballer reported shortly before the game about Twitter and wanted the UFB ladies everything good.
The Bayern Legionary is like a club college of UFB Captain Schnaderbeck and is joined with our lady.
The second of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motivation price.
The famous Bayern Dussel may also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with the Rheinland-Pfalsian Minister: Economy lo _ Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Grene) and Rheinland-Pfalz, was often irreversible.
This shows more than one year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is at office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on request T V of a change in the economic policy, and the old minister is at the same time.
Frank Natus, president of the Association of Triyer Company (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the desires of the economy that Lemke has blocked all."
The biggest turn is seeing Natus in the infrastructure policy: the closure of the car 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the list of priorities in the country.
In this year, the Minister hopes for a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the west round of the Trier, which is in the preliminary need of the federal road plan.
The aim is to carry out the street in December 2020, says Ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide in it to have regional, but international competitive companies.
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber (IHK) Trier streer, as suggested by Wissing, in order to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exporting for years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish a own company, the IHK.
In the new Master Bonus, the handheld room Trier sees a successive incentive for young educators, says business leader Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the continuous master examination and 2500 euros is expected to be self-subordinated within the years after the training of the master.
However, the home task list for the country remains long.
In the planned road building, it is quick to create, at the same time the country's needed staff, says Jan Glockauer, leader of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set mobility in the landscape, only 29 places are occupied.
The IHK requests to forgive more tasks to external offices.
The CDU fraction vize Christian quickly refers to the account heading, the country investors 2017 and 2018, more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the acquisition of country roads.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as it wants to deal with the lack of experts in the region.
In addition, the broadband building in the country is renewable.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated the network supply in a IHK investigation only with the note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and interruptions.
The former Minister for Economics Eveline Lemke is currently out of the face and is still located at the wind-force Board of Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become a president of a private school in Karlsruhe - where she had released the field after four months of disappointment.
Audi will make 850,000 changes the own vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with an opposite reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was thinking that "the smarter options are more than driving restrictions" and that he related to ≥ towns - including monkeys where BMW is seated - to prohibit or intimid the vehicles.
Daimler said on Wednesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modi to reduce its diet emissions.
No one of the companies describes the enterprises as a revocation.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of vehicles in Europe and the United States to undermine the compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the stick oxides that emit diet engines are considered as cancer and can cause asthma.
The costs for the car manufacturers to install installing facilities to neutralize the gas exhausted by the vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
The German Federal Chanceller Angela Merkel is also accused to disturb the powerful car forms and to ignore the signs of the problem.
Companys try to avoid the mistakes of peoples cars that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the requirements when a car was tested but returned in normal conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of peoples' cars, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamics was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former Manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not subject to delivery and could be sent before the court in the United States.
In the beginning of this year, Audi was incorporated into German criminal investigations in the peoples cars after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to implement the Emissions Regulations in Europe, and an extension of an application that could be extended to the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could hardly charge peoples cars: the Luxus car manufacturer contributes overproportionally to the winning of peoples cars.
This message has the flood on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants the Isar.
To also participate in the Isar visitors, the morning Saturday will be a flood through monkeys with a special message.
Whoever goes back to the Isar on Saturday, he will see a great floor between the flaws and the rike bottles.
And this is not a usual flood, with isar tourists.
Specificly, the bathroom is trying to open up.
On the flood, you see a great information transparency.
It shows a M'berg.
The record of a public campaign to call the Isar visitors.
With the Motto "What love is..." it will enhance the understanding of the Isar as a valuable wild flow.
In the last summer, the flood was over the isar, and in this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a viewable and environmental behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennase and laugh against suffering
Mordillo was timely one of the most published cartoon characters, the knollennasses of his figures are his mark.
In addition to 85, the Argentina is still on a movie.
His message: Laughing, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he struck himself among otherwise as a designer for happiness cards - what frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my great life was the day that was lost in my job," he said once.
After St° in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60 ’ s of the interruption: with the publication of his cartons in "Paris Match" and then in "stars" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist of towns always reads to be inspired again.
Great, round Mordillo figures are assembled in drawings with the Shipping Turm of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the red place in Moscow.
In the morning, he sits on the signature of the same day, almost a few hours a day.
Over the calendars, puzzles, books for gross and small, T-shirts, birds and hours are still a lot of spread worldwide.
Since six years, he has also been on a character trick movie and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' best animal in his designs - who has a thousand fibres as opposers.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which will come in 2019 to the cinema input.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The draft book is not written by him.
That is why he makes the TV series, which, as its original records, is produced without words.
Lavendel from the Province threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of the Province in South France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is delayed because of the conditions indicating to dry, and because of the diseases, which are insects, which are increasingly pained by producers and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in the Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence is effectively added because the plant has exposed the impact of the climate change, which has brought much less rain in the early year and in the herbst.
This has effect on Lavendel's life duration.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transfers the circtics, and in a very dry weather there are many of them."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil is not only locked for holidays, it is also very asked for parfume and cosmetic.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, under-developed and either defective or weak.
So we have less parts with atheric oil."
The solutions taken in consideration include a better water distribution and the slowness of deterioration from the ground, but also the effects of the pfs with a slight mixture of sound and water and the development of sorts that are more resistable to dryness.
The village Geisa in the Thuring Rhön celebrates his 1200-year-old existence today.
The festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age festival.
Cross, tens, traders, vacants or a landscape will be experienced at these days in the town.
The killing of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly period Riodoce are usually taking place in the middle of the week to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officers and unresident wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-range journalists discuss what it feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front side of the room: enemy, neutral, associated.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, advise and feelings.
There are smugglers, businessmen, journalists who are suspicioned to stand on the list of contents of the Government or the Cartelle, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.
There is no relaxation of violence, and while the body is coming throughout the country, there are still more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has reached his office in December 2012. 589 stands after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries in this year.
Among the latest, her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the companion of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with.
His failure will be deeply sensitive, although his presence is overall - a large picture of Valdez showing his medium finger with the word "Justice" depends on the fassade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the three years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, ○ T-Shirts showing his smileful face with brille or his typical Panamahut.
The workshop finds less than two months after death, and the reporters discuss about their shared subjects, the trauma, their alptrions, sleeplessness, Paranoia.
Although 2010 was established a special union lawyer to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal procedures, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the thousands of murders connected to trade and organized crimes each year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely presented before the court.
In Riodoce, they are still on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are irrelevant, and though the territory is still more traitor.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the debate of security, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to lose my time in this workshop," he says.
"When we don't know why, we're all missing."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Office of the newspaper Riodoce in the city of Culiacan.
He was only able to drive a few blocks far away before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced outside the car and was shot on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the magazine - translated by "Twelve Fluss".
The Sîe went into a car and protected it nearly.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two raised children.
Guests aim to be free in Culiacan.
But for the theme Valdez there is practically nothing but weight.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and delivered to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody fields of the country, since rivaling groups were fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't indicate that in Sinaloa somebody or more people will be shot every day on the street or that the Friedhof is filled with dead, two-scale muscles for kings who are greater than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "roe" if only one card has the control over the coast state with its valuable gates and trading routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was conscious of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a companion of the founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by the fault that he could not dispute his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have come to the murder.
In February, there was an interview with the Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising card fractions in the war with the sons of Guzman.
This publication may have enraged the sons, supposed to buy any exemplary of the dead, as soon as they were delivered to Zeitungskioske.
The second error was not forced to force Valdez after a newspaper that had published the same history to leave the country to his own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and foreign, and his murder is viewed as a milenstein in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had so long overlook that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
In 2003, he was a experienced reporter for the Northwest when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and covered 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "is it impossible to exercise journalism, without to stand on the crash tax problem," Bojorquez said.
With time, the newspaper deserved a call for the courageous and honest reporting, and the conversion and publicity increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-to-doing studies without ability before Zensur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else guarded to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In that same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican history, wherever it was brought.
He volunteered that he had.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ signature.
Trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take the task that pleases you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do about so many deaths ... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the funeral bird who could flee like a port worker, the friend who was generous with arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to overcome.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always have his hot.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for Rutine destroyed?
His death also forced her to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and remain alive.
"You don't like it if you're working with your wives, children, their clean business, their secret starting and landscapes," to move,
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high measure of self-sensus and self-reservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away.
The difficulty is, said the author of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "Greuch a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is dealt with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States where a toxic mixture of lucrative shoes, weak institutions and corrupt government officers is at home.
The landscape is still changing.
In the room where Riodoce's workers met for security training, they were suddenly not allowed phones. Days previously, Spyware was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two cops seek protection against the hot 104 degrees (40 ° C) in a tree shadow.
They were ordered by the Government of the country to sing the Offices of Riodoce in a four-scale building in a quarter of Culiacan.
In the middle of the division, some reporters asked whether these officials belonged to the 50% of the police, which the Governor himself was not trustworthy.
There are months ago since the reporters have entered the mountainland where the bands are de facto controlled.
Riodoce looked at three main stories for the dead this week.
There was the murder of the brother of the former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure to the state expenditures that could be able to go to the city of the Governor's home.
And there was a group who had done an exemption in one of the most precious restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the State lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who was removed or how it happened, so it was offered caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the aurant is a favorite location of traders and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the aurant was registered under the name of a Governing Institution Revolution Party (PRI) who had almost all political levels over the entire century.
Recently, several Pri-governeurs were accused of high-charate cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman had a military overcome.
Only a few months ago, the readers would have considered the columns of Valdez as the best informed source of the exhibition.
"We had already known what's done," Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his slight body station.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The Office of Valdez was surrounded to the preservation room for signs and clusters protesting against the murder of journalists because the workers have become something that they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the State lawyer.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the West Federal State of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and the officers said based on DNA tests that it is his.
In the whole country, journalists have become sounder by writing down in organised protests "SOS Press" on roads and buildings.
On this day, the Regissor Bojorquez is gone to Washington and trys to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spion and kill journalists because they said the truth.
She has since asked her to be re-distributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her object.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "reduced" by organized crimes, government officers and equal society.
In the last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by bands but also by order of security forces and the organized crimes under a cover.
The media guard group "Article 19" has assigned more than the half of the attacks on police journalists and officers in the past year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, murder has a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of Bloggerin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note that seems to be understood by Zetas cartell: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and heads are located near their separate head.
Some have chosen to conclude how the journal El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the corresponding Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo did after killing her director in 2004.
2010 the diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the cards with a leadership on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists are from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in the exil, and they still watch the streets and look for.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue working, it is a daily dance with riskable decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be closer, admits that the trade fears him.
"Mexico goes to H ́e, and therefore I became reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last morning was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizen's top before the office and drunk beer as they began to summarize all their phones once.
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the bathroom Mazatlan had left 19 dead.
The war continued to scale as it was pronounced by a series of Cartell boats in the region.
They published the news on the site of Riodoce on phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Syrians shouted near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a cock on the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they had it at all, they didn't show it.
Under the great portrait of the falling founder of the magazine, whose medium finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it," Bojorquez said, "if the same day Javier was killed, the practicant asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dinosaurier used to evacuate his enemies
On the first corner it looks like a statue, even though a terrible.
Now researchers have discovered that the first knowledge of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker was so well obtained that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurians".
It was so well obtained that they could even find that his swimming skin was of red brain - and they said that they had had had something of a "unsusable past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" covered him as "the strongly paniced dinosaurian who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurier examples of the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosau, who lived in the middle of the cross-time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incrediblely well-obtained state has become a researcher who described it as "really noteworthy"
According to reports in National Geographic, the paniced pf-freener is the best obtained fossil of his kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed unexpected from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more accurately.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg).
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be enth.
"If you just brilliant a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it had slept," said Capital Caleb Brown, a publicist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to see.
"It will enter into the history as one of the most beautiful and best obtained dinosaurian examples -- the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurians."
Scientists have discovered that this pf's fresh, although he is covered with a cut and is like a walking panzer, probably threatened by meat-freeding dinosauriers.
The strongly painted dinosaurier used a red and white darkness to hide themselves from raw animals, and used a depreciation technology that is anti-scate, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed a better mixture in his environment and extinguishing his enemies to say experts, which indicate that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurians.
The 110 million years old creation from the Nodosau family made the first row in May and is now to see in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Scientists now studied the wild animal and it called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the exemplary enabled Dr. Mitchell and a international team of professionals to document the pattern and the form of shoppings and breakings on his body.
They discovered the contrast, a broad defence method in the animal country, which means that the top of the creation was darker than their subside.
Although the contrast is usual, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is overwhelmed by the living animals today.
It indicates that the dinosaurier was hunted with sufficient pressure by meat dinosauries that the evolution favored the degree of confrontation as means of survival.
But most of the timegenous animals that use the contrast - you think of rohe, cebras or cattle animals - are much smaller and hurtfuler than the damage, which signals that this nodosau was exposed to a real war of survival.
"Starkes raw animals behavior on a massive, strongly paniced dinosaurian show how the dinosaurian raw animals must have been in the cross-time annually," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurier was rotated.
Objectives continue to investigate the animal on indications of his life, his conservated Darmin content to find out what it has eat as his last dinner.
They believe that the dinosaurian, when he died, walks into a flush and was cast into the sea, where he was cut on the back to the sea.
At that time, Alberta was so heavy as South Florida today, and rivers and ocean probably broadcast much more inland as they are today.
"This nodosau is really valuable because it is completely covered with conserved skin, but remains in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost like today in the early crowd time.
You don't need to use much fantasy to rebuild it. If you just divorce a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The cross-time was a time, as a great therapy, a meat-freeding dinosauriers, standing on two feet through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyronosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the paniced dinosaurier was hunted by some of his horrible forefathers.
This belongs to the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of hard monster.
The economists whose latest knowledge appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta has been deceived after death in the sea and mumied.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best panded dinosaurier in the world, → skin and washing, and is complete from the snippet to the hole.
The creatures were about 18 feet long (5 feet) and weighted up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It contained two 20-pound-long springs that were driving from his woods.
The scientists believe that the paniced pf-freeer was thrown by the Western Canada until a overflow flood flooded into the open sea.
But the subwater relocation of the dinosaurier kept his resort in exquisite detail.
The rocked remains of this special exemplar are so well obtained that the herds are still covering a lofty panzer plates next to the dinosaurier
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is like 'sound as a winning in the lotto.
As far as I see it, it'll be confusing.
The stone remains of the skin are still covering the holprid panzer plates that cover the animal's shadow.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are praised up.
I can count the shoes on his socket.
In the wheat: Mass carambolage on A8: vulnerable damage
Several accidents on Thursday on the A8: button 30 vehicles are in a mass cargo.
There are many damage, miles long dust and gaffer.
On the train of Stuttgart-München (A8), the latest Thursday afternoon in a mass carambolage of about 20 people have been hurt.
Following the first information of the police, at 17.00 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (land Circus Aichach-F ́berg) during some 30 vehicles, including probably loading, were united.
The precise number of vulnerable persons had no information.
A police speaker said that it was easy to medium-severe damage.
A large offer of saving vehicles was at the accident.
The A8 was completely locked.
In the road direction, München was a mile of long back.
As reported by a AZ reporter, it also came to massive obstacles on the road - by numerous gaffers.
The firewall noted the characteristics of the vehicles that now have to be counted with sensitive punishment.
Shortly after 18:45, there was another second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a pkw.
A salvation shooter was on the way to the accident.
German train: Concern tested "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has learned: nothing else is seated in the train and sleeping.
Or you are deep in his work and just have a genial thought.
And then: puff.
Come to the crew and wake up an unseen or travel to the train in the middle of the workflow.
Card check.
But the times of interruptions are quickly over.
The German Bahn is currently testing the busy cart check.
You're just busy by phone to take his place and evaluate the cart.
Currently, a test operation is running on two streets.
"If the boat comes, we'll talk about it.
Then, probably, the next year will be available on many other remote transport lines in Germany," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the road card evaluation without creators.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a phone or a tablet.
And you have to have bought a online ticket -- what the most traveling guests are doing.
Moreover, it has to be over the application of the train that cooked the DB's tower, which is the best type of ticket booking.
And later you needed a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You're going to the train, calling his cart under "My tickets".
Then, at the tests, a button appears to be electronized.
The train members will receive a notification on their mobile devices that X carrier is located in the train and has taken the Y building site.
If the train member comes to the cart checker at Y place, he knows that there is a passenger with already evaluated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which will use the passenger again.
"Who wants to relax without ticket control through our train staff, simply checks in the DB.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personally in the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing representative of DB remote transport.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customers' needs."
Those who often travel, know that near delays and lost moves belong to cart controls of the biggest difficulties.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the travelers does not have any documents that you need to revalue online tickets.
Anyway, the credit card or the personal certificate is missing or another document to be shown.
The consequences are unfinished discussions between train members and train guests, which lead to bad vote in the division or large room and delays in control of their own ticket and takes the creator at the end of the time to take care of other advice.
Only a small number of tests can use the new service.
And this is only on the ICE 915 Dortmund Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart eatings.
Other move numbers on the same street are not yet enabled.
How did a activist learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot up to his kernel.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of a airbnb apartment that she was moving and scrolling via Facebook on her phone.
She had a post from someone from the High School.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," he said.
Sorry because nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she stopped Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handbook @TheePharoah was always acted on its timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's territory was with Michael Brown's death, a 18-year-old black, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to get alive.
He posted a picture of Brown's leblous body, stretched out on the street and stayed four hours there.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But the death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her phone to get back to Tweets later at night over people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who brought a gun with the record: "Fergusons police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a living feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrants with a pleasant dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried, "I'll kill you all animals."
"It's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we used and that we can typically call."
At this moment, I felt a shot.
I was wretched and wept."
She offered a flight back and went home next day.
After landing at 23 hours, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets"?, in the Kinos since 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of people who have lived in the Community and made the roads to request answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who had a flower clothing and a crown, moved to Ferguson, the two mentioned a speech that they had “on the black experience and the black state” before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you where black people must fight for what they believe?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What is today is a high point of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be opened in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various shifts of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the happiness to give her an experience that she personally does not have an eclatant racism, she is not different than the next black women's children.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep her away."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florient Road, a place against the police member who became a camping area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusations of officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter connected themselves to a local business officer who made a breakfast.
They prepared bags and helped to deliver them to demonstrants.
Slowly a new type of activism for Ferrell shape began to become.
"My activism has changed totally after August 9," she said and noted that she was student at the University of Missouri St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses and was able to relate to eating justice and healthy inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organising.
It's all coming."
Week later, Ferrell met during a night demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-registers of the film.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado solely wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell in the sense: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepsis was given by numerous cases of people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We heard that people who were born and wake up in Ferguson did not raise their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already joined with the current co-register Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is a place for his activism around death-track income.
His commitment Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other inhabitants, followed the team of "Whose Streets"? in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us.
"This was the main thing for me, how these people are drawn, because so I will be drawn."
The goal was not to be able to acquire Ferrell's experience - to show that it was not a Messianic leader but a community that gathers together," Folayan said - she proved himself as the openest participant of the film.
Thus, documents of "Whose Streets" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she is deceived and married to her wife.
"I felt as naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I realized that in this work and in the mixing of black people there must be a certain hurt."
Furthermore, Ferrell's story repeats the role of the black boys in the widespread Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three reasons for the movement that after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, the film "BlackklivesMatter" in social media, are identified as a bullet.
"Sware, swimming women in positions of conduct have made the movement at all," Ferrell said, "and therefore we have always been fighting at different fronts.
Sweetheart women must be the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it refers to that "this is not a claimable type of action" in the Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film.
"It was the person who dropped this energy," she said.
"It's not a case, although she was at the front front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, black woman is so much on the game.
You can track their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have been long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police are still existing.
Ferrell is on the car for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a car in a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she claims to a spring and feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We have to love and submit one another.
We have nothing to lose -- except our legs."
From "screen" to "size": TV reader discussing bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a purchasing room at the south end of the footpasser zone since the first presentation of 2009 has split the population in the Before and enemy.
Cold doesn't leave the theme anymore.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg" the subject is discussed.
Wearing one to the bit gallery say, "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be a real class" (Nicole shooting) comes from the other side: "No man" (Siggi Betzen) or "Great Wood!" (Lars Scholz).
As the employees are more able to build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opposers forbid that the foot-passer zone will then blow out.
Additionally, the gallery is planned exactly on the base in which the building halls are located, in the 13 direct assemblers offer their products.
With the beginning of building work, it will be a conclusion.
The galeries makers want to integrate a market trail in the new building - even to beda-place with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost a week in the building hall for many years.
Of course, our eggs, but also the cooking cooks of the landwomen, are still very pleasing.
We've also discovered the meat tools for us.
We would like to have the opportunity to keep this boat up, even during and especially after the building of the gallery.
In other cities, there is also this.
In particular, the small halls in Frankfurt are interesting."
Gerd Densing: "In order to settle directly in a market valley in the gallery, it comes to the height of the middle.
But the new project may not be just low."
Eva Kilic: "Why's the shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, Drogery or Supermarkets: I find it overflow.
That's enough in our town.
You see how many loading businesses have been empty here -- some months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular week here, it is much more important that at least we keep the market number.
Because the product offered there is always fresh, mostly it is offered directly by the manufacturer and is higher price.
As you see, loading businesses in a purchasing center are applied only by larger companies, because they are often not able to trace for a single trader.
Damage, special businesses are almost no longer, and whatever remains from it will still disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping room with a market rental doesn't match me.
And the gallery doesn't match Bitburg.
In particular: Where should the building Halls go during the construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for the time when the bit gallery comes really.
Or can the latest bit gallery ever be able to extract all business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs it.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmer, instead of this gallery.
But for a building hall, thanks to the wounds of many -- how I find -- without sense, building projects in Bitburg are no longer located.
When the building Hall is caputted, a piece of culture will be disappeared again."
A similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brune, which are almost inevitablely equal - which are dependent on cabells from the cover.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wall-towers and hairs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the extracts from the prison fort Leaven-- where the former secret service analyzer offered a 35-year-old arrest penalty after she published a secret diplomatic report on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is A Becoming Resemblance (A similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose disabilities were united in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transfraction and a dissident whose condemnation Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been drawn up by the algorithmical analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone might look like with these genomic data, even though something intellectual comment is not only regarding the imaginability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and created the inherent determinism of this interpretator - but also the futureity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly since her puberty about the implifition as a woman, was condemned in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations against the spionage law, computer fraud and diet.
Through the prison, her image was so much that there was only one photo - a black-white black seal, in which the maning is probably sitting on a carrier sitting and wearing a platin blonde pearl - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of its 2012 'Stranger visions' project.
In it the artist produced portraits of forests from forensic artefacts such as cigarettes and Kaugummi, extracting the DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time she received a mail from a magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to join this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit this time and couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
Artists and her arrested museums were unlikely letter friends who exchanged several letters during two years.
They even cut one of the Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Sholi Kanungo, which proposed a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually require only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There are also some deep and Starkes for the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informationers from the government camp and against transgender groups to find new, double ways in order to continue to escape the star spreads that he should make.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timeing of all these things, she said "the things make out of a certain basis".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, maning requested with its great signature below (the "i" in her family name is deceived with a heart) an end of the "automatic splitting, which was based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the integration of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) as amazingly similar, at least in biological view, we are all.
"What people hopefully take of this is that our genom does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is too to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a own room is a page from the above covered comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free speaking phone from the disciplinary casiers of the United States like King King.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it says.
"Never keep your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelia.
"I'm still getting honey when I'm talking about."
Maning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it has been predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks, by their own genomic simulators, which join themselves as horses of protestants.
This was also targeted, as all in the exhibition, until the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplos groups were written with bleast.
"In the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a human quantity," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portrait.
"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stood behind her freedom."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an Oxford University employee seeking for murder
A country-wide human jail is a professor at the Northwestern and an Oxford University employee, seeking as a suspicious, after a man in a luxuous apartment in Chicago was struck with mortal damage.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder because of their advanced contribution to the death of Trenton H. James Cor-Duranleau, as shows the acts of the Cook County official court.
The documents say Cor-Duranleau, 26, died after several pieces.
One Community warning system published by the police officer of Chicago stated that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several damage to body.
Cor-Duranleau was still explained at the place of the event for the dead, and detectives investigated the stake as a murder, while the police is actively looking for the two suspected officers.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology at the Northwest.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in a email statement that Lathem was now authorised and has been excluded from the coming of the campus of the Northwestern.
"This is now a criminal matter that is investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistent at Oxford University.
One speaker of the University and the Somerville College said in a e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigators in every way of the earth."
The statement suggested that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be.
Boss Communications Officer of the police officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he requested the suspicious to take place the authorities.
"The police has a idea of their stay, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities would help to find the suspicious.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a racious tip, who said that there was something in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as a very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident also found place on 27 July.
It was assured by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The maintenance team of Grand Plaza published a claim to the people: "The police is currently at the time and background of the victim and investigates a number of motives, a possible home accident."
"We will finish the WADA plan in the near future" - the Russian Vicepremier Mutko
The Russian Vicepremier Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Do Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Do Agency (RUSADA).
"In a specific stage of achieving the criteria of the road plan, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Do).
WADA's plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's carrying plan to comply with the code described by the criteria for reinstallation of RUSADA and recently published on the site of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could give anxiety to Russia.
"All has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympical Committee (IOC) and the WADA in closer future," he adds.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian Anti-Do members must openly accept the results of the investigation authorised by the WADA by the Canadian legal lawyer Richard McLaren for Stately promoted Do in Russian sports.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We conduct the investigation because our anti-do system has occurred a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no national programmes, and we will not give anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Sōnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Do Commission.
In talking to the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Sõnov has raised problems of the past in Russian Anti-Do organizations, but then add: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains conflicted positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Sõnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 by the WADA in the movement of the Do-Scandal from the implementation of Do-controls in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the view of international experts and the UK Anti-do (UKAD).
After a major fourth of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be restored.
Aldi's first no eggs' eggs
This is what the company groups shared.
It is a pure perspective measure, which can continue from no health impact, it stated in the Communication.
Only eggs should be delivered to Aldi from immediately, evidently negatively tested on fipronyl-containing anti-lease.
Aldi wants to make clearness and transparency in his customers.
The startup ups that will help your company not become to the next top
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness in your e-Commerce start-up, but the investigations did not work.
The answers were often worse, little helpful or - even worse - disappointed.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers do not trust the process.
"There was just never consistent and objection," Errett said, who operated the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-up is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measurement of the employer's commitment, it allows enterprises to carry out investigations, to speak special groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and difficulty hotlines and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to handle the C-Suite leading forces and directly to the Administrative Board.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, companion of founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytic tools are used to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said that they had a better view of what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint.
In addition to the Snap Requests and Questions of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows on a cut, which units have most difficulties and which powers of conduct show low approval results - so you can follow why.
Companys are going to realize that you must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next top that has been screened in skandale since an ancient employer has published a blog mail, which describes an environment of accusations in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For startup-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business opportunity after a review.
The global governance, regulation and compliance broadcast 2020 could increase more than $118,7 billion, according to the financial site Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw an increased interest and A's start of this year in the mistake of Uber.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, ↓ Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently been reported as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies can send mixed "Puls-" interrogations, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problems.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline to report bad behaviour to the employees.
And when the Master Business Leader is involved, the complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has adopted the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the basic and business leader of Convercent.
When an undertaking is found that is badly treated or behaves unetical, it can experience valuable consequences through consumer buykott, worker fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the aurant chat with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 places, has set Convercent for more than one year to ensure that the employees are aware of their own and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centres.
Earlier, if a employer wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the business centres, to introduce a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken.
It was often an inquirement and unfair experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no possibility to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company uses Convercent, problems which were previously hidden by leaders who were sitting in towns or states - such as discrimination, disappointment or unlaw practices - may be faster identified and advised.
"I can draw closer to this total, 360-grade view to the experience of employment," Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we're taking our shareholders before employment laws."
Company started to take more seriously ethics, values and employees commitment in 2002, after the booking company Arthur Andersen assembled for ethical violations through the Enron-Scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time until the "Social Media arrived to their right", that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their disturbing weapons online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a Property," he said.
As well as Convercent offers your software as a service, and the company charges with renewable taxes for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million when financed in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was summarized to $47 million.
Glitzern assured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and totally financed $60 million.
These investments are rarely surprising in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high containers and interesting projects are only one.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they hear their voices, and that the work you do are rewarding, they feel more binding to do this company," Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Client.
Investors get rentals when their portfolio companies run well. Companys run well when employers are engaged and engaged.
If the Analytics Tools promise thirds to add commitment and the use of the employees, it is not wonderful that you find support.
Data on the worker's commitment are important after experts of the workspace culture.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take any measures.
In fact, if a company asks a worker after your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, this disappointment can disappoint and demotive employees.
"If you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4.000 talks," said Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Cotter International, who has seen the company who has been too long left on the collection of data.
"If you don't follow, you'll ask the employees, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care about that?
And who don't care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, now conducting monthly interviews of employees, was able to implement measures on the same day when a problem is reported on clint, so Errett.
And after the collection of feedback of frustrated workers, she was aware of the difficulty of decision finding and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications education to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new views of the employees, and it hopes that in long view, this leads to a better link of employees in a branch that is for high ranges.
"If you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose clients, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the bruins
It is 23 hours when a lot of UCLA-football players are discussed on a side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus.
Some have extracted their tricotobers and showed the backs of full swimming from the first day of the training camper.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a breakfast at midnight.
Players who are entered in the summary sources will return to their final tests after three hours of exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treasure for the guys next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became on Monday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and she has actually extended its days - at least until the end of Friday.
Therefore, the first three training of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 a.m. to be justified by the already packed time plans of the players.
The compromise is away from the two days more than one day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood practices.
They are to stop during August 18 exercises. 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparation for their opposite against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he would undermine the regulatory change of the NCAA, even if it adds another point to the players' multi-occuped routes.
"We put this great burden on her three or four days, and it's very exciting," said Mora.
"And they've just passed through it, they're going on, they're great people.
I think soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will exit its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be easily responsible for the clear viewlines of its fields from a border parking place and the Luxkin Center, a hotel of the high-country class, which has already been trained with footballs, which spacing a protective network behind a towerpot.
Bruins players are going to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora agreed that there could be a problem, soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We'll use our security," said Mora.
"It's a real problem, and it's not so much to think that people get a room in there and then set up to open an exercise.
If you have the video band of a exercise, it's a pretty business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on Parkplace 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact checking in the fight against elderly messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false notices to third parties and show their results under the original contribution then, the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in an opinion on his website that it would start using updated machinery learning methods to identify possible false notifications and send them to verifiers, which may show the results of the tests from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for the fake news that many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a great political issue in Europe, where the French electors were overflown in the presidency elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not have to quickly remove hated postings as before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to Germany that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new review will be started.
"Besides the knowledge of the stories of inspectors of parties, people want more context to make founded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
You will add that Facebook will continue to test his feature of the "connected article" and other changes in message-feed to reduce the wrong messages.
Create a comic Roman: a close in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was to see in a Squee-Music Video and was a blow for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has 700 years of turbulent story of a pleasant seat in Be日 River Valle in Kent and has now become inspired for a graphical Roman of Jamie Rhodes, a mofaric Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has died for 300 years," he says bitterly.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spent the time from the age of Edward to the age and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony MayËth, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I just reacted to the print of the pump on the side of a letter that was written by a double ladder in the 1700s, which was for Jacob," he said.
"That's his pump!
And the letters are always smoke, for at that time they burned a fire because of the light.
For someone who is 300 years later, the Church has a effect as if he was himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived nearly four months in an end ("To be honest: I have a little overvalued welcome"), it seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos spent his days to announce the victorian "new" closure, to view the archives and to study the many seeds and curiosities of the lock, such as the mounted hyenen heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He turned through the land and the ruins of the ancient village and talked to landscapes, gardens, and sometimes with artists who guard at the illustration of his book.
Then the night he drinked "Whiskey and began to write."
The intime story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust first received full access when the last herb, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a year later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "thousands of years when Aristocras said, "Oh, put it on the dachbound."
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards, which represent who had something: "You might think that land conflicts would be long-term," says Rhodes, "but there was a beer to fight the two families.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the village as a beginning point to enter on a larger basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer' who follows a man who leaves the new building to join the building up of 1381.
"There's a record of a rebuker that occurs 1380 in the closure, in this book with the title 'Knightly families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The building opposition began in this area, and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are constantly in the story of the lock - such as the "Priest" who told the story of the Jessus patriarch, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reform.
Or the 'The Smuggler', in which the Smuggler Arthur Darrell is presented from the 18th century, who insigned his own funeral by making a sack with stones (a discovery made first years later, when his sugar was buried).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' Loeblings family of Scotney: "The lords seemed to be quite guilty, always doing debt again and spending money for things that they couldn't offer.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women -- I present them as a lot of good looking boys, with a talent to throw off."
After the end of his use in the closure, Rhodes is searching for other unique writings
He brought a two-week residence in the Finnish wilderness for a Comic-Roman over the Elegum ́i, the territory of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been required from the nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he said.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to be done again with the fucking life."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old marine capelles in Rhöndorf
With the prevention of the 301 years old marine capelle in Rhöndorf, the city Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new Dachmark (Rundview of Thursday).
By Thursday, citizen Master Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team about Nelson Art will keep the logo and the Slogan secret.
On the end of August, it will be a festival on the Grafenwerth Island as a high point of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the Maker of the action has asked the places at the Rhöndorfer Capelle since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their yesterday free website.
"But we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make clear that some things are better than it seems.
In fact, we are the strong conviction that we as Bad Honnefer are well-known about the beauty and Attra of our city."
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a Slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one who gives the city an unchanged unique character."
They are in competition with other communities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new dachmarks and campaigns.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogans before the army
Each year, beginning August, Ankara of the Master Military Council (YAS) consulted pensions and transports in the Of­ers Corps.
It's like this week.
On the first corner, a normal process.
But nothing is Routine at the Turkish fighting forces one year after the puzzle trial.
The meeting was no longer located in the building of the General Staff, as before, but at the office of the President.
The President of the Government has now participated in the consultations by the five vice-premiers and the Minister for Defence, Internal, Justice and External Ministers.
This means that the civilians in the YAS were overnumbered.
In the military, the Government takes the moves.
Head of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains at office, but the military, air forces and marine commanders have been suspended.
Since the failing coup, the Governing Boss Erdogan has earned 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army series - mostly because of common connections to the movement of the Exil Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which seems Erdogan as a draughter of the puzzle trial.
In contrast to 486 persons who would have been directly involved in the puzzle trial has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the puzzle, Erdogan had committed the temptation as a "God gift" because he gave him the opportunity to clean the fighting forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army?
On the end of February, the magazine "Hurriyet" published a article with the title "Unappreciation in the military headquarters".
In the General Stab there are anxieties about a continuing "islamisation" of the army, which, inter alia, manifests in the cancellation of the soldiers' headquarters' prohibition.
Great cleaning in the army and security forces continues at any time.
In mid-July, Erdogan allowed further State servants to fire, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan took the military.
The generals had been able to be earlier than the gentlemen of the country.
Three parts of the world's state rule, they called on their role as guardians.
Following the election of 2002, Erdogan forced the military step to step back, not in terms of vocational reform rules of the European Union.
Earlier officiers say that Erdogan is aimed at islamizing the fighting forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a non-numerated officier, who was looking forward to persecution in the foreign asyl, the Turkish army will be "full extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such development could not cause Nato to cold.
Without prejudice, there are doubts in the Alliance after the purification of the Turkish Army.
The driving structures and operational skills are "bad", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stricter rules for the achievement of visa for a periodic employment authorisation and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two rooms of the Congress.
"This law will reduce the poverty, increase the loans and save billions for tax payers and will do this by changing the way the United States will issue the citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent the migration of the chain and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English with the financial means to submit themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy," Trump, quoted by the media.
Ministerial wants to sanite strecks for the rental hot
In the past months, the future of the roadhouse has always been struck - now it should be quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is to be built at the marode street on which the tourists are running.
In order to ensure the future of a long-term rentalhouse, building should be started in this year, according to the information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"As the decision to continue to order and sane the stream of Ilmenau renewment, the country is aware of the important connection for tourism," claus State secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt stated.
The costs for the establishment of the segments were about EUR 2.5 million.
From this sum, the country takes 75 Pro.
The Treaty, on which the Shuttle is to be established in the future from the country, is currently finally voted, explained.
The Ministry and the South Thursing Travel as operators are already agreed with the technical details.
"The plan, the vehicles set and the quality standards are being handled," said Sull.
The scheduled Treaty between the Ministry and the Travel Society will be closed for a period of 11 years.
This would be made regularly available on December 2017 to the rental Shuttle.
The Rennstop Shuttle is a popular driving connection in tourists between the Ilmenau and the roadshops.
In the past months, a pilot manager has been tested whether the stream of many people will be sufficient to reorder them regularly in the future.
The street is also strongly constructive in parts.
The growth of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Soon as you thought that it could not be deceived in 2017, a new report on the ambitional developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Fund for Responsible Robotics (Function for responsibility Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five-years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emerging professor for robotics and artistic intellectuality at the University of Sheffield and the FRR's companions, we must begin to take their growth seriously.
Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, his form of brushes and the type of fingerprint.
"The people make themselves fun about them, but the enterprises provide any amount of it, and we will see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.
Modern spups have developed from their explosive partners to robots with a siliconaut that feels heavy - with conscious human reactions achieved by the artistic intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" according to his convictions and select everything, from the color of the robot's eye through the form of the brushes to the type or colour of his fingerprints.
But it will be more difficult, since many robots have the "personality" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern shoppings have developed to robots with a siliconaut.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows his users to adjust their robots to the properties that they find in response, such as sweetness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex Roboters developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which provides the impression of cuteness and "Wild Wendy" with a "aventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adjusted as well as possible," warms True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her votes during the day - just as real people!
She may be silent, fixed on conversation or she may be "in vote"!
There are many disturbing aspects in this growth of sex robots - not added because they replace real human relations - but the needed women's properties, the examples of administration, if you have a step on Frigid (that is: opposing) Farrah, are injury one of the most.
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"When women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not only a female or holding a different sex game tool.
Your growth and their continuous raffinations show something dark and deep in our culture, to a return from the idea of the equality of the gender's equality to a desire after sex with subsequence as a optional assignment.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR observes their increased popularity, they remain temporary at the border of consumption.
But what is crossed out of the border zones, can be very educative about the spirit of the time we live.
And many people are not strange or reasonable until the free market allows them.
There is a certain surrounding that these highly developed sex robots have occurred in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has spoken to have sexually attacked women.
The most terrified aspect of the television series 'The handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of Magd') is not the graphical images, the burned body and the exhausted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a run, but this is not like a big speech at the moment.
The objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if with pornotar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But when it's about their "personality", the robots don't represent real women.
You can't separate yourself from your fellow or simply leave.
You have no meditation or a background story, nothing that hinders of independence or something that might result in the fantasy of total submission.
Otherwise: You are adequate slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 talk: services
Trumps' great performance?
He makes the middle of Romney to understand the healthy human understanding
It has become a ambiguous evidence of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polyrised the US election have also divided families in small formats.
In the United States, there were newspapers with advice on how to handle the horror of Trump families.
We strive everyone to put our filters on.
Less noted is the power of Trumps to gather families.
I have learned this because my cousin, a left-hand witch, who has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the unit against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows is the Republican family, with which she has been fighting for years, suddenly and totally owned on the same side.
This is certainly a matter of eating, but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks to it.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the exciting effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "Normalization" and Trump, we relate to the terrible possibility that his meets of one day will not be destroyed anymore.
However, there is a more terrible long-term scenario in which the Trump of the Republicans of the right wing "normalised", which suddenly appears in comparison with its standards.
Today, I find me a active nostalgie for the urchemical version of the foolish - the dog on the car dach, which 14% of income tax (but at least we knew how his tax clothes seemed) - that both in comparison with Trump actually occurred as a very mild criminal.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy to be qualified as an unforeseen improvement.
When my cousin was in the town, we kept our children at Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Carussells of the New Yorker Park Department, and the best three of which you can get out in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are extremely large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are curious and the animals turn to look fullly over their own decks - extremely light and the climbing music provides this in a strange way.
So many closes of a city are deceived: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are to be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified by the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the theme Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big circulation in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carussell is still a strange magical experience, since there are two years of age, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and everyone has a great time.
If I could evaluate the Carussell, I would have given him the full number of points, but, for fortunately, no one asked it.
On the other hand, in this week, I was forced to evaluate my "exercise" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could take my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to compare the assessment with a 15% drink money - this is to buy something about the ladentic.
This leads not only to a delay of what should be a neutral exchange, but also to exercise pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the purchases was excusing, while I needed the experience to give her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius sent to the hospital with breast pain from prison
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
In the past year, he was brought into the hospital because of the treatment of snippets, which he took to the prisoner after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned after a call of the state advocate against a first murder trial.
He killed stone camp in the early morning of the Valentine Day of 2013, and shossed them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in ↓ House in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he had his friend to be a night-rangling who hid himself in the cabin.
The state advocates have announced their intention to present this time against the six-year arrest penalty of Pistorius Appell, which they say it is too careful.
The National Criminal Prosecutor said that they would be raised an appointment in the Court of Justice of South Africa and could be heard in this year.
Pistorius runs that his penalty will be increased at 15 years when the advocates are.
There is no death punishment in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger Schools, the fourth chairs were released from foot and oven hair to the vacation and to the continued schools.
Three students go to the Gymnasium, four to the real school.
Leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the city home Biesental in Epfenhoven.
As a symbol for school release, the 29 students of the four classs chose a young adler in the cotton, but then will be released into freedom.
To that end, the monster skar led a music with the title "The Adler in the coast".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and he dropped it from his kitchens.
Instead of a kitchen kitchen, a small adler came out.
But the hope of making a hull of him, the Adler spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, the classs three and four showed a shoot dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hairs danced with the young gockles who were carrying cylinders around the league.
The adler stands for the integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the girl is different than the other girls (cookies), it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a huh.
His destination is to be free.
She wanted every quarter chairer to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Mâer, who continues to enter into training steps, and the parent representatives.
The kitchen time is now over, explained by class teacher So′a Schumacher.
She left her students in two years of teaching only very unfortunately because it was a really great time.
Finally, they could have been able to trust the fourth chairers.
At the end, all students gave a song of summer and vacation.
This is a great pleasure for children.
Eight first-classers have already been reported for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal campaign in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece, and the Ministerial for External Affairs, quoted by television, shared with.
On the morning of 1 August, Police was arrested by the police in Sithonia a group of illegal offenders, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently running.
The BTV reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the control of the free camps and set up significant money penalties to everyone found in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will be continued during the whole season.
The Ministry said that the Court could charge a penalty.
Software updates for Diesel vehicles: What the people need to know now
How exactly does the software update find place?
Should Diesel Factor share in the action?
The main questions and answers in the review.
During the diet-gapfel, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Concern offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.
They want to improve the conduct of emission class cars in Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action obligatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The obligational updates before apply only to vehicles that have shoom software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their engineering has arranged the power carrier unit (KBA).
How and from whom are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a proper implementation in the following months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler told you to write every person concerned.
If a inspection has been successful, it will be carried out in their framework.
How long could the conversions take place in total?
"Sure to say," says Smetanine.
This depends on the commitment of producers as well as on political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act in the environment yet."
How long the update should take?
The engineering itself could take only three to four hours in the workplace.
The time-service may be to get an appointment.
What do car drivers do not drive cars of BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW concert?
The ACE advises to wait.
Increasingly, foreign producers would follow Smetanin.
Is there a massive price fall of Euro-4 cars now?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where carrying prohibitions are threatened.
In the rural room, there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
○ Cool J receives Kennedy Center
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glomous events in Washington.
The first price delivery under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prices doesn't want to come from protest.
Cool J (49) receives one of the desired expressions of the renommed Kennedy Center.
Like the cultural arrangement on Thursday, this year also belongs to the chief song Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the Choreografin Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV-product Norman Lear (95).
The exhibitions shall be transferred on the beginning of December.
Traditionally, President Donald Trump will make a receipt and share in the delivery with his wife Melania.
The progressive TV series-addictor Lear already announced to dismiss the participation of the Gala.
The New York Times said, "This presidency has decided to deteriorate the arts and human rights - even to remove the resources - and that is a burden to me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the talk with Trump to clarify her vision.
The Kennedy Centre, called John F. Kennedy, is the largest culture institution in the US Hautstadt.
The former prices include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city living valuable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's town tree officer, goes to rent in the next year.
The position is already written - the appropriate applicants, however, are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a town tree.
And the work still makes him great pleasure, as he provides in the press talk.
He reports of differences, but also requesting tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet received the application profile.
The city looks for a architect or building engineer at the moment in which it is possible.
Thus, under the regular announcement periods, it must be sufficient time for an integration.
Since Haslach works as a underlying construction staff for the administration community, the applicant must provide the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they were not able to fulfil them anymore, the citizens should go to Offenburg.
But citizenship is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good operational climate and a good vote between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have been gathered, looking back to the wakers with pride.
"We make the city vital," he's safe about the building and his workers.
But in the future, there are many different projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hucla-real and the netherhoven park is about.
The Kinzig brush between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium anaging is still the subject.
Only the last one will be put to books with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," it appreciates Wacker.
"All in all, good jobs are waiting for my followers.
The work here makes it fun."
Formerly available for a town treehouse of a large game room.
Haslach’s own building and gardenship can be reacted quite flexiblely.
"You can move much," so wacker, and the design of the Green facilities is often praised by citizens and citizens.
Since the old city is under memory protection, it is important to have "a eye for what is fitting" when rebuilding is approved, the separate town tree is emphasised.
Without it, the town treasure has high responsibility.
He's Bauherr, "It's all running over my table."
In support and coordination, he can count on long-year employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in Manfred Schöner for 15 years.
Although his follower remains long, he wants to wake up: "We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a operational climate but also for the further building of the city.
Whoever wants to inherit Roland Wacker should, after the outcome of the city of Haslach, provide a completed term as diplomatic or Bachelor with expertise architecture and have expertise in the areas of construction and construction.
The urban building office is undertaken by high- and depth building, building planning, basic business businesses, administration of urban properties, town business head with building and urban garden, as well as low building rights members.
Road on guidelines: South Road Locked
According to the police, the unrecognized agents had made the blue road from the train transfer in the Leobener Street (B116) to the leaders.
These were so strongly protected that the following goods were to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male acts and look after them since the night.
Near the tatort were observed by witnesses a rosarotic roller and a road-free.
"It's far outside a puzzle," said the OBBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The staff or the staff would have taken themselves into a large position, and they would also have made the movement.
Besides the damage of the lock and the installation, as well as the delay minutes and the costs for the shining trading can also be reached on the staff.
In total, the speaker said that it was to go out of a "enormous" sum.
The damage was resumed on Friday afternoon, the train on the southern road could be carried out without obstacles.
Button → Personnels were fallen on Friday morning, two of them related to the remote transport.
The goods were not exhausted, but they had late.
According to ÖBB speakers Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overlides were to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also protected.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to linch IBD (unclean fuel illness)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a alp dream for your sustenance system.
However, a new area claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich on meat-based proteins and milk products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammation diseases.
The unhealthy state in the United States of about 1.3 million and in the United States 300,000 causes magic potassium and bleeding, repeated or bleeding accidents, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
In currency, it is usually advised to prevent meat and milk products to reduce their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential aminosic acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant darm.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunition patterns in the darm to ensure that damage microbs that hide themselves in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to solve inflammations will be equilibred from cells that promote tolerance and cause the body to damage without sensitive weights.
If the equivalent is too far in the direction of burning, it can result in an inflammational illness.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promotes immunition in mouse, which is a certain bacteria in their inhibitors.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the buildings of proteins - to eliminate the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have a connection between a kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus re日i - which is a normal part of Darm microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
As more tryptophan had the mouse in their neighbors, more they had of these immune counts."
He proposed that the combination of L. re日i and one to tryptophan rich nutrition will promote more tolerant, less inflammable darm miles, if the same system works in humans.
The postdoctorian Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immunity that encourages the tolerance when she found that a group of muscles had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was subjected, but it had not.
She assumed that the subdivision had to do with the darm microbios of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruses and pills that usually live in magic darm trace.
The mouse heat was sequentized by DNA and there were six types of bacteria that were available in the mouse with the immune numbers, but without them lacked at the mouse.
Mouse was opened in a sterile environment, so they missed a darm microbium and they did not develop this kind of immune, and they received the L. re®i and the immune counterfeit.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. re日i grew up in a liquidity and then transfered small amounts of liquidity - without the bacteria - to unreasonable immune cells isolated by the mouse.
The immune numbers developed to the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from liquidity, it was shown as a side product of the tryptophan metabolism, which is indol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased about 50%, but when the triptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased around the half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse, and that most of us L. re ه in our magic-darm traces.
It is not a matter of whether tryptophan-new products from L. re日i develop the cells in humans as in mouse, but the defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammation.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control burning on the inner surface of the darm.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in presentation of L. re日i can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "Genie" with Nonnja Matic
At Manchester United, with Nonnja Matic signed a "gene", Jose Mourinho believes after the Middle-Work player had his debt against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-session game before the EUFA Super-Cup starts on Saturday against Real Madrid, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed in love.
Matic, however, was excluded from the Blues Preparation Asian Tournee and made only 45 minutes, which Mourinho suggested that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He has spent time, but his experience, intellectuality, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him to be ready before later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the aviva station, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Inde enthôt this week that Mourinho wanted three more obligations, but he said that the club had already done a "fastic work" to fulfil three of his four priority obligations.
"Tree of four, I thank the One," he added.
"I will be more happy if they get four of four for me, but they have made great effort."
Boeing "malt" dreamliner in heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the silhouette of a dreamliner in heaven.
The pilots fled from Seattle in Washington, but the drawing started in Marquette in the US Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which is a number of thousands of kilometers.
The action was 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens, it was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a sustainable test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing Logo were drawn into heaven.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was a SPD head, social democratic presidents always looked at the election with a certain concern to Berlin.
Unless only a fire from the partition centertrale, it was not an opposite wind from the band - it was the most important desire of the electors.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, it has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the workers from the Willy-Brandt House have watched the events in the SPD government heads.
What schools have received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the opposite wind.
There were deep shots.
And one after another.
The Federal CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Axes.
"This shows more: Red-Green can simply not be confidential," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network of Germany (RND).
The surprising exhibition of a Green Deputy has led to a serious crisis by the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD).
Five months before the country choice, his red-green coalition lost its voting majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Business Leader Michael Kellner invited the Netherlands Green Deputy to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear misunderstanding of the electoral will.
Each question must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Business Leader and Election Champler of the Green to the Editoring Network of Germany (RND).
"It can't be true all of this," said a SPD election warrior, when the new Jobsbootship reached the party central.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister of Niedersachsen, is there after the overcome of the Green Deputy Each Tests to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional point of a whole series of large and small crisis in SPD countries.
And no one knows what's next.
The criminals began with the unexpected clear decline at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no longer, was the pleasure of his time.
After the day choices in Schleswig-Holstein and Northern Rhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
Then it also became - and even though everything became clearly worse.
The download in Kiel’s SPD in the tumbs, the Düsseldorf-Pleite higher the party.
It was hard to remember the enjoyments in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they just made new courage, the G-20-Gipfel came from Hamburg.
And the next depth came with him.
Citizen Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country boss, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city.
And because he did so much wrong in the crisis communication after that, what you can do is wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struck for his political survival.
Now also, Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW outputs and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Ministry has already been criticized for a long time.
Miscellaneous survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or maybe just that, because in the past weeks, he tried to put the accents in the band.
The effort of Hannover's former citizen to build his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be allowed because they decreased a stability of the party.
Now the exact opposite may be.
This is because of the part-in-the-the-ground wheat of the low-sachsian green, in fact, does not be guilty.
And school isn't anymore.
In fact, the pleasures strive to keep their own orders closed.
Their wrath is addressed to the Green, and in particular to the detrimental Parliament's question.
"It is inconsistent and democratic, as Mrs. Twesten puts its own care interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Chief of the Participants in the SPD Country Group, the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten has not been chosen as a direct candidate, but as a result of the list of the Netherlands Green Green in Parliament, as the Lower Saxon member continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returned her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD Constitutional Group, regrets a "undemocratic manover".
"The elector wille was clear four years ago: the people have made Stephan Weil to the Minister," says Uppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a spontaneous candidate to the election of the day, the RND.
"Now the personal career of a future CDU deputy is worth the choice result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clear the backgrounds.
I want to know if there was more or that there were continued complaints of the CDU.
Payments for the locations III
Whoever wants to be sanited in the years, it can be supported by the country.
Citizen Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG town development informed about this midweek in receipt.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler again looked back to the evening.
Since 1991, there are sanction areas in receipt.
At that time, in the sanation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took up two thirds of the support sums.
In the sanction area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant continued to be 60 Pro.
For Schindler, the current sanations are a "success project" - it is important to promote the internal development, not only to include new building areas.
On 4 April, the Government president Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a sanction area III.
The amount of aid is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 from the country, receipt from the community.
How is there a sanation area now?
You will continue to examine where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in sanitary health in the planned area.
Where appropriate, the area borders may be moved again.
The STEG represented the middle-weeking Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Programme "Social City", in which the sanations would be carried out.
The keys of the programme are the revialisation of internal sites, the improvement of residence and work and maintenance and the development of infrastructure.
The measures would have been implemented, namely by part.
The sanction area would then be defined as a statute.
The authorisation period for the aid is running from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the stock record would only be carried out, in the context of which the shared in the sanction area will have a questionbook to be fulfilled.
The decision shall be taken as far as possible in November or December in order to begin the sanctions in the next year.
Pitzschmann then explained that each commune must perform the previous investigations considered.
It is to evaluate and decide where the state-building disasters are sanished and in what way.
It will also be included in the basic book for the basis.
Pitzschmann will come back to receipt and make a picture of the situation, promise it.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the contribution of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be postally sent to the citizens in the next weeks and that they will be released until the end of the summer vacation.
The yellow questionbook is the "building and baseline bow", which is inter alia related to the building state and sanation plans.
In the green questionbook, the "Housing and Apartment Box", information about size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "building" is only to be filled when business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it is to be considered how Gotzel pointed out that an issued questionbook is not a request for aid at the same time.
In addition, rebuilding measures are not supportable.
Schindler also pointed out that the distribution of the contributions worked after the "Windhund Prince" - who comes first, it meals first.
You can't be able to "reserve" for later.
For the end, more photos of the "Location II" project were shown to make the presents a sanation "smackful".
British finder sees himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British finder is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, attend his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the winning chip between dumbs and show fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined himself with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advising anaestheist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantation process is conducted according to medical standards.
Technology is like a cat and dog implanted microchip and only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the lockers at homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both home and with BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on tax.
The advertising of the White House costs the tax payer thousands
The decision of the White House to flee a Marine Hubschrunner to South Lawn for an event that highlights the production of the Ananias last month is costed by tax payers according to the information of the military that was left to the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and leading officers of the White House made a walk through products from all 50 countries.
The rubber prepared in Connecticut was exhibited near a yacht, a car from Wisconsin and a bullet stapler from Mississippi.
The military office of the white House requested the presence of the hubshubber in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the hairshot landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operating of the hubshawder.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is a so unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 beforenight of the event, the representative of the Marine Commander for Air Travel.
The message showed that the rubber came on 17 July at 7 a.m. at the South Lawn for the event at 15 a.m., and remained until the race was released between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note (f) adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed, the limitation of the service times would require a second flightmention.
The original aircraft was located during the event at the hobshooter, while the unit's safety staff remained on the ground during the time of the aircraft.
The records provided by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight was required.
The Ha Act prohibits federal employees to use public property for political purposes.
Data levels show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could corrupt the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Ha Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you're closed," answered the representative commander.
The event "Made in America" was covered by the White House as official event and would not have been covered by Ha Act.
But also of official events have political surfaces.
In the event, the Chairman made an approach to the reform of the health reforms held at the senate and promoted the efforts to deal with Government laws.
The use of the aircraft, which is Marine One or Air Force One, for political beneficial purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents are committed to use them to travel.
But to require their use only for a photo-op, it is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president's aircraft carried out before his first campaign in Melbourne, Florida, Taxi Services, and his Twitter account is full of notifications that demand for the use of the president's aircraft by his advocates.
"The White House is enjoyed by the show "Made In America" - shows the products from all 50 countries produced by workers with ananical materials," said the representative press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 occupations often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop the US presidents in the white house with precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was beginning July on the G20-Gipfel in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 practices in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was the need for training for the month, said a officer.
Helicopter units passed at 11 hours on this day for "No-Presidency submissions".
The White House said that tax payers took the burden for none of the other requisitors presented in the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not shared in setting up the hobscreen on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not provide budget records for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
However, according to the U.S. Defence Minister for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rates for VH-3D are 24.380 USD per flight hour.
Records of the unit deduce the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operating of the rubber are far under this rate.
"Determining the costs for tax payers based on payments for compensation rates is most irrelevant," Walters said.
"Thes include personal, storage and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the remuneration rates for DoD do not contain the staff, but take account of the costs for the tissue, storage and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former press speaker of the white House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the rubber for the event.
"The idea is to present these weeks things that will be produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal State Connecticut are very proud of being involved in our national security, and I believe that hundreds, unless even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, as most Americans we are all proud of the shooters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been insolent.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight it."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the hubschrauber when he walked over the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting at a firewall seat.
In the white house Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives and broke with the media over his own float of business products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before touching task
The second Tennis-Bundesliga headers are attended at the third table searchdorfer SV.
The TC Blue Wiss Neuss comes tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table searchdorfer SV.
Despite five parties, the second tennis-Bundeslig header has still received the meaning of reality.
The team head of Marius Zay has any respect for the enemy.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar training.
Just on the back positions, I find the community very well."
For class and stability in the search village SV, imports from the high north are mainly provided.
"Your Danes and Finns can even refer to one part in Davis' club.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay with a touch on Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Switzerland), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This will always be hard for us.
There you also need a portion lucky."
The newsmanship for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debt for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it is not to the Federal Party in the Challenger Turnier in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will come to the first use in this season at the Czech Turnier in the Czech Liberec.
The unseen Chilene Hans Podlipnik Castillo was yesterday with the white rose Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbuel in the ball.
But he should be in Kiel like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories on the last Sunday against the Alster club, Maté Valkusz could return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number of one of the Junior World Trade List in January 2016, someone from the tragedy stab on Marius Zay will open the frame.
How America can damage the OMV
Donald Trump did not really act when he put his signature under the Law on the deterioration of the sanctions against Russia in the middle of the weekend.
"In his temptation to adopt the law," the Congress appealed a few "constitutional rules" and ate.
Moreover, the reaction from Moscow was so nice as expected, and even brussel shook against the US adversity.
The draft is always intended to punish companies that help Russian to build gaspipelines in the EU.
Compliantly, investors of the home OMV have been deployed, which, together with other companies, have contributed to the construction of the Russian East Sea Guide North Stream 2.
The Drohculis is great.
However, it is too early for assessing the consequences, as the official statement of the oil concert.
In fact, Donald Trump himself must have raised the sanctions by executive order to live.
Twelve weapons are in his choice.
"The Press" has seen what the concerts could delay and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Paul, the Cali Cartel will be cut into the middle of Netflix
Despite the second staff of Narcos, which enths Paul's killer, the series of Netflix is not long ago.
The staff three and four have already been occupied by the Streaming series, which first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the staff, the DEA addressed its attention to the world's richest organisation of trade: the Cali Cartell.
As indicated by four powerful patterns, they operate "as a fortune-500 firm" only with more state-leaving and violent action.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the Cartell, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) orders the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the criminal and cooianian persecutors, to undermine war against.
Other new players are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The Narcos' staff will begin on 1 September.
Role backwards: The city provides 46 kitchen help
The city organizes the Qua's midday table again.
With firm contact partners for children and a team assignment.
In the towns of children's days, the hour is returned.
By 1 September, the town Krefeld will recover the food supply in the towns of children's day (Kitas) in its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, representative leader in the Youth Aid Area, this is a message: "We all have been very happy."
Cooking is continued outside house: A cater takes this task and offers fresh cooked cook.
The city was 46 children's days in the crop area, and in 44 children receive a warm dinner at midnight.
In the last Chinese year, every 2800 children were sitting on the table, and the need was continuing.
"The middletime is not only children who are born in 45 weeks, in the midnight of Kita," states Pommeranz.
"This boat also applies in the 35-hour control when children stay up to 14 hours."
46 part-time forces have a kitchen service since 1 September: they have consumed the angelic foods, added them to salat, rock and fruit, share the food individually, give food, release, split, and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group institutions - decides about the time range.
"The kitchen helpers now belong to the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfying.
"So they are much more connected and it is to implement simple, pedagogic concepts for cycling."
Because it is also: healthy nutrition and cooking.
"The children need to help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is significant.
Also for the kids.
"You have a power in the Kita, a person trusted in them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - too, the task of the kitchen forces - will be made futurely by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the training of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm that she has made in the comparison of the costs between the own region and foreign transmission for the city as the economicest, as well as the cooking performance.
And that, despite 46 part-time powers are re-installed.
"But these hours, about 750 people in the education area are not so strong in weight," said Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghanistan Democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Whales can only be representative when all members of the society, women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan in the midweek.
Nicholas Haysom, officer of the United States Mission, said that hundreds of women in the provinces will be candidated. Three women candid for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30% of the newly registered electors are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement midweek.
Waves can only be really representative and credible if women share unlimitedly and be included in all parts of the election process.
Afghanistan elections for the Province Council and the presidential elections are located on 5 April.
The Taliban has published a choice process which is involved in the transition of international fighting processes to a advising role.
In this year, the elections will be delivered peacefully by a democracy-selected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghanistan independent election committee reports that 1.2 million women registered by 3.6 million electors were registered.

Men try to exit a 13-year-old girl
Two young men in the age of 19 and 23 years would have been trying to excite a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police information, the men talked to the 13-year-old friends who stayed on the Col’s street against 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone with the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the actors tried to take the phone and the hole of the girl, but it was missing.

The investigations are running.
GMB Business on Investment in McVitie Fabric in Glasgow
A facility wants to ensure that the Managers of the Biscuit producer McVitie about the long-term obligation to produce in their work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company has increased investment on the Tollcross stand.
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse near other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last years.
He also adds that the workers and the company representatives would "release learn" if their activities were changed.
In a letter to the leader of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested to "remember that the financing for modernization of production lines will not be proposed".
GMB-Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can not win clearness from the General Site Manager about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is the deepest concern of our members.
Geners of families have been here and the workforces can strongly address the local community and the Great Space Glassgow, a important column for human employment in a area with high unemployment and social communication.
Therefore, under the perspective of workplaces, payment and prosperity, and in the light of the breach, the increased life-keeping costs and the chronic production degree of Glassgow, which causes a flowing production presentation in McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said, "The leader of Tollcross has first received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly, since we appreciate the continual commitment to employers and employees.
We had a regular meeting two months ago with workers and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the workers that we, like all companies who are active in a very competitive and unsecure economic climate, are to check our business running - and that applies to all our business areas and places - to remain competitive.
They add: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross stand, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as full and complete production sites. If our operational applications change at the place, the workers and their business representatives will be the first to learn this."
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago of Neymar?
The page of La Liga may repent its interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left in their persecution of Neymar after she has delivered a boat of £ 189 million to solve his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the welcoming accident?
The sensational approach has touched the transmission window in summer because the Ligue 1-Club is ready to break the well-treeword to more than the double of the present mark, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United at the past season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar will be given to the world's most precious player and to the world's most paid Profi sporter. PSG offers loans of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is sure about how Neymar forced his way to go out, although a source near the Catalan Presidence is that the club has always given it to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the President of the PSG three years ago from this view?
When Manchester City 2014 announced interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each one who wanted to undermine one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to let one of our players submit, this will have the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have overcome this line, while the Spanish Unit starts this summer's interest in the PSG media player Marco Verratti.
PSG explained that they would not allow the international from Italy to travel in any circumstances, and Barcelona could see the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Dumspatten report deployed Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Court of Justice on the misuse cases deployed Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse candal at the Regensburger Courts continues to be discussed.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the Reform Movement "We are Church", explained after publishing to the German Presse Agency, he expected from the former Regensburger Bischof and today's Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mâer and from Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerging father Benedikt XVI., a excuse.
It would serve the view of the Catholic Church very much if Mâchers and Ratzingers expressed their deep suspiciousness over their own submissions or their wrong appreciation for the actions at that time.
Consequently, the Vatican magazine "Osservatore Romano" criticized that the report on violence in the courts with "dual measure" will be reported.
In the context of the violations in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is "smacking and confusional acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but it is obvious that the "great median manipulation", such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historic and member of the national Italian bioetics committee.
"The habit to deal with the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the daily practice and prepares the public opinion of maintaining it as normal," says Scaraffia.
Priest Gloria of Thurn and Taxi also mentioned in the interview with the Bayerian: "You are pleased to go to the church and this is a feed found."
○ she pointed out that in her youth, "the shoes were a very normal pedagogic means" to be done with fresh children, as I was.
They thought it was unfair to apply today's standards to previous years, because the world has changed.
In relation to the reports on the misuse cases, Popst Brother Georg Ratzinger was often developed.
The author and historic Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, made the memory band "My brother of Papa" (translated in 12 languages).
"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," Hesemann says, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly states in the 440-page report, which the legal lawyer Ulrich Weber has submitted by Bistum Regensburg with the advocate?
In total, 547 Regensburger courts were "with high plausibility" victims of violations, 67 cases were sexually misuse.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "There is therefore generally found that Domcapell Master R. has been applied in many cases of physical and mental violence.
Just in high emotionality, the penalty for the students could also be higher.
Nevertheless, contrary to numbering other accused ones, many victims appreciate the whole humanity of R. and therefore connect to him in many cases despite violence even positive reminders."
In the interview Hesemann explains why the concluding report on the crash candal at the Regensburger Domspatten Georg Ratzinger was deployed by his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "consequences of violence on protection commands at the Regensburger Domspatches" gives an opposite picture of Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger.
To one, many students have shown his "humanity".
In other cases, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist, who has become a handscape of the eighter, if a trial is not musically a top performance.
How do you appreciate his biography this conclusion report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from front to back, you must ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.
He has just divided eight pages, and it is clearly spoken by every deceit of the mediator or co-conscience in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violent exhibitions in the pre-school also occurred outside its efficiency.
In any case, it can be forbidden to learn about it too late or to have not taken the first infections seriously.
The judge patentgymnasium on which he acted was found by practically every questioned as - so fairly - "resolution", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the large majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, represents a completely excellent witness, describes him as "warmshirt", "belie," "surrecent", "kompetent" and "intelligent", as a very good teacher, who regularly provided the boys with kitchens, kissons and bonbons and "always preserved of kids' wombs".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has led to wut-outbrows.
That he was not only broken with stones and threw the key band on the ground, but also split ears and moved too frequent boys to the hairs or ears, he has given himself a year ago, deeply suspected and apologized for it.
However, his honour must be said that such education methods were largely spread in parents as in teachers during the questionary time, in the 1960s and 1970s.
Do you still know these methods of discipline?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I have also learned this in a world school, a stately gimnasio.
Compared with what is in this report, which is the deceitful sexual abuse and the violent exhibition in the pre-school, they are freely battles.
There is already a question of whether it is not more to do with his knowledge and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI, that many media just fell on him.
A lot of people who have never understood him are still zealous.
However, the truth is: The report is, George Ratzinger, in every way!
In the media, the report has been reported very much about the subject of misuse in the Regensburger Courts.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be charged in the final report or any development or consciousness in relation to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not clearly.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claims to have trusted the Domcapell Master.
Not even the parents were invoked.
"I never believed to talk to my father or mother about it," said a person concerned, "I was all very painful."
The real problem in the remarking of sexual abuse was, but most of the victims were weak from shame.
If they don't even trust their parents and sisters, they would certainly not be a chor leader who would have been a colleague of the workers.
How, then, are the Courts-School Ratzinger's role in misuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student formulated it: "I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had had ha ha haha modern knowledge and could have stopped the respective worker.
I think it is ... too for really absurd, to be able to be calculated to him ... bubbles of intriguing or clearer or even more open than to their parents, internight leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... inevitable."
The report is thus clearly reported: "The fact that students and/or their environment were confidential to him could not be assessed in the context of the investigation."
As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from every science.
Thus, he can not be predicted not to prevent or have brought him to an indication.
Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name to these current crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases.
In the media, many of the "Waltexches" were read at the Regensburger Domspats.
The former Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Wegview".
Should he live with this promise?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting, everything was mixed and mixed to a huge misuse of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of the report, Georg Ratzinger.
However, this is again a misuse of the report.
It is pure: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Courts, between sexual abuse and violence, and, once, other proposals.
In addition, the report has discussed events since 1945, as well as four years old, in which George Ratzinger wasn't the leader of the courts.
All the terrible tests, in cases where boys of sadistic teachers were regularly skinned and maltrated and laid down and were deceived, all occurred in the pre-school in etterzhauses and pillars, where they had to have been really scandalous conditions.
However, Mr. Docapell Master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them because he only received the boys in the face when they were already on the court-pattengymnasium.
On the way most of the Witnesses showed the theme "Preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to have disappeared and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the court-pattengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although there was a Dis ’lin, there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "much victims appreciate the whole humanity of R. and therefore, despite violence, even a positive reminder to him."
That's the best way that the plan is to have been looking away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported of the situations in the pre-school.
The first time 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and from the works at a school where he was not acting and responsible, (as the Witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the court patentgymnasium, who even reproduces the report.
In this he points to them that "the tests are continued to be practiced in the pre-school."
In view of the negative press publications, he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, when tests were also forbidden long in Bayern.
Before, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as everyone of us still knows.
It was also difficult for him to appreciate where the concerned might have overthrown or dramatised and where the permitted limit was actually exceeded.
But you can't even say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
In the first year 1980, the trial in schools was also dismissed in Bayern of Family.
Priest Gloria of Thurn and Taxi claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogic standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are historicals talking about the "Fallstreck of Anachronism", so that it is to evaluate the past in accordance with today's moral standards.
That's what the prince has right.
However, it is not of course applicable to sexual abuse, which has been disappointed at all times and not to what has been violated in the pre-school of countervailability and violence in innocent children's areas, that is already far beyond the public at that time.
It's all very terrible and I'm glad that it'll finally be opened.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means to disturb and punish, so to drag orrhes and to the hair and ears, were largely spread in the 1970s.
When he was then prohibited by physical penalty, he also acted strikely.
What picture of his Regensburger Time did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of Daddy"?
Did the issue of the tests also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about his brother Joseph's life, so Pope Benedikt XVI, spoke from his perspective, where the courts played only a nevenroll.
Yet, I don't dismiss that he has led a strict government there.
However, this must be said once: Without this perfectionism, without the requirement of unconditional disabilities, it would have not been possible to form a institution of worldwide, true cultural boats of Europe and its musical tradition, which were two times in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) to Tournee.
With cheekses and bonbons alone, you are not making a big song or any success, just in which area, but always disabilities, suffering, and self-sufficiency.
As a man, do you have Georg Ratzinger at the talks to his book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and above, I really knew Georg Ratzinger very well and always as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believed and gentlemen, who can't imagine that he can't do something too.
I regularly agree with how many former courts still today, 23 years after his emerging, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was strict to them are clearly in minority.
Most of the judges are thankful to him today because he has cut off their life and has drawn close to them the world of music.
And that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that could be - but he was also a loving person of respect to whom they are looking at today and to worship them right now.
And please, again clearly: All that you do to him is training methods that were at the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it's most unrighteous, a man, only because he's prominent and has another prominent brother to make a medial sin box.
There is only too obviously the evil intention that stands behind.
Because the report that has just been published has been discharged.
Now the situation would be commanded to leave a 93-year-old man who has made great debt and without the outside of the Bayers and maybe Germany would not know the Regensburger's courts finally in peace.
