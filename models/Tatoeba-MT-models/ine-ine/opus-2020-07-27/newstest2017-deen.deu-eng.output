28-year-old kitchen found in San Francisco Mall dead
A 28-year-old kitchen, which was recently found to San Francisco, was found dead in the stage of a local purchase room.
The brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who wants to hurt him, "It finally came to him again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall in mid-week morning when the 28-year-old Frank Gallicia from San Francisco was identified, the court-medical department in San Francisco shared.
The Department of Police of San Francisco said the death was considered as a murder and the investigations were running.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, shared the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had earlier cooked in Boston, had found his dream job as cook in Sons & Daughtersaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & Daughters said that they were "shocked and shocked on the ground."
"We're a small team that is like a strong family and we'll miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and attendance are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia suggested that Frank lived in hostels, but that, "the things finally went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," shared Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would like to damage the younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting to his family was always to cook us something to prepare our dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of discharge.
He was the brother who was sleeping with the power.
"In all that is running in the world, he was this unslaved diamond that lighted every day," he said.
Every person with information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under points 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in shopping
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or perfect.
This has made the Hollywood Star clear in an interview now unexpectedly.

Golfer longer gets the sport pyramide
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a Golfturner in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a little difference with an outside on the beach.
For the 58 years, it was a Prime Minister.
CHIO: "Goldne sport pyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses were reminded of their featuring evening, and they hunted in a quick galopp at home to the feedingstuffs.
A mile at this time, I've gone.
"There was no experience," says Langer.
And that's why the Reitkare ended again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golf of all times - 101 tournaments - again near horses.
He and his family led over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even wear to photos.
He was the first time in Aachen and that was also in the CHIO.
The reason was absolutely convinced.
The German sports aid delivered the golden sport pyramide to the man from homes in a small gala.
It doesn't miss the sympathic sporter.
Federal Service Cruz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already divided him.
Longer is the 18th prices of the sport pyramide.
In Aachen, he met the first prize officer Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This expression means me very much," says Langer, "for it will be forgiven not only for sports success, but also for social commitment."
Since a year, longer it has promoted the growth.
And thus he continued the price of EUR 25,000.
With 15 more exciting sporters, the U.S. Master Mayor two times on Saturday was entered into the "Hall of Fame of German Sport".
The exhibitors belong to the lightthletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fat Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrrer Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Schock meal and posthum of the handballer Erhard wonderful.
Property of these sportsleaders came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative society turned into the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price was running.
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - that will be both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two U.S. presidential applicants are in tax and energy policy, as well as in a principle.
The difference in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, more philosophic subdivision.
The one, over the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep it smaller in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can damage - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to death, he says.
He would be very different, he claimed Trump.
He will return massive regulations and make it strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies.
However, Clinton says that the State has certain tasks to carry out, he has the opportunities to open and cost money.
That is why the taxes would be increased for the rich, says she.
Interestingly, both are very close to the Infrastructure subject.
Trump and Clinton are almost equal to the needs of investment.
The Democratic applicant has announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic and are strictly rejected by the State critical teaparty flights of the Republicans.
Thus, on Trump, part-internal discussions could be reached.
The subdivisions in energy and climate policy are more fair.
Trump wants to build coal powers and rebuild coal promotion into the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far as possible in areas that he wants to announce the Parisian climate protection agreement.
However, Clinton, with its investment programme, wants expressly to build the renewable energy and calls: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"There will be either China, Germany or America -- I want us to be."
However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the transpasive trade agreement, does not want both to be subjected.
At the same time, however, both of the United States do not want to isolate from the international trade - but simply make a better job.
They should be paid better, like Clinton.
The current minimum loan of $7.25 is a hunger.
He wants to add it to 15° per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not absolutely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be made up, then he says that it should not be changed.
However, the great debate in the coming months would be more likely to develop about the tax policy of the two layers.
On the one hand, Trump wants the economy and the citizens to cover growth.
His criticians will take care of him, so that the budget deal would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the riches to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Flight: "Every lightening woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who fly alone, almost every day.
When they come to Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a big kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least one year old.
One put her little son in his arm.
He looks very interesting in the room with great eyes.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she realizes that she's watched.
She's laughing shortly and kissing the kid.
The scene works normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a regional business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bayern, and is inter alia occupied with the subject of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the North Münchner in one of the few decentral accommodations for alone-refugiated women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment with Pro Familia and the Münchner women's assistance.
It was recently opened or opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There's no men - not also as a guest.
The exception is a guardian at the door.
"It's not overwhelmed to say, every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened by fools or death or because their families send them to Europe as a leader of hope," she said.
For women, there are other reasons for the fleeting: "There are many who steal secretly because they don't see any other way."
In their home, they have made experience with sexual violence, victory, honour kills, slavery or force prostitution.
That's what they're doing.
It's going to go on to the flight.
"The sleeper for example requests a sexual action for a bottle of water, for example, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not scared by their families.
Who believes that the end, soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Moreover, only-like women in refugees would often be viewed as less valuable and unused in the worst case.
This results in some 90 percent of women living in the apartment in the North Münchner, they appreciate.
"Some of the children have certainly not been volunteered."
Women are so habitual that they don't say anything.
Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too big.
Since they often did not know how to help, there are more accommodations only for them, Barr requests.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the delivery of refugees.
The question if they knew about a similar project like in monkeys in their competence area, some answer no.
In the surface and surfaces, there is nothing like this in the government's visits.
Even in Swabs, only lightened women are not undergone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Presse speaker of the Government.
In surbayers, sub- and medium-grounds, there are stockworks or own houses in some community undertakings only for women and their children.
The exception is Nederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women.
In the European Parliament, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equalization of the Seeds calls for women to be subjected by men.
In a committee published to the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be resorted."
"If men and women fail or are subjected together, it can be - constant - violence against women."
In particular, the washing rooms should be driven and easily accessible for women, it is found in the area.
How much women consider this protection need, it is possible to be able to stop the Andrang that is on the house in monkeys.
"Severally since it has spoken that we are there, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors: Requirements for new work fighting measures
Representatives of the doctors have invited their association to approve new work fighting measures in their conflicts in relation to a new Treaty.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of British Medical Propertyation (BMA) has requested its entire Council to approve more work fightings from beginning September.
The JDC stated that the Minister would have refused to enter into the concerns regarding the Treaty.
In July, doctors and medical students voted on the derogation of a treaty agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of his members who voted at the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "perseverably safe" to problems, which resulted in rejecting the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC voted to reject the proposed new Treaty fully and requested official negotiations for all your concerns."
As a response to the weakness of the Government, the JDC proposed today a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of work fighting at the beginning of September.
The conflicts led to the six-fold aid doctor this year, the first total accidents in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistant Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the choice to revoke the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared the BMA members at the meetings that still found before voting by 54,000 assistants and medical students with the advantage and adoption of the Treaty.
After voting, Minister for Health Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for doctors in England would be forced.
Russia and Turkey: "A Foreign Alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Saturday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite in the charged salon of St. Petersburger Palastes, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this disappointment in most cases.
There was the handshop, yes.
But Putin's laughs were smally affected, and he strained a little heat, even for his retaining conditions.
Instead, Recept Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly by "love friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve.
The next day, a magazine described that Erdogan would have taken it as if it had never happened something bad.
I felt his enthusiasm before to interpret the opposite.
But one of Putin's exciting, sustainable coal showed that the ruler of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the exit of a Russian campaign at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow reaction at the time was wounded.
Putin divided and accused Ankara, Russia, to fall back.
The past was even greater because it was done by a friend.
Rebuilding the vetrous will be difficult if it is not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the stately controlled media have committed a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
Once it seemed as if the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious was the accusations of leading officers that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has dealt with this very hardly.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
This meeting was only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to buy a sort of win.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapons standing are clear.
Erdogan first needs all friends that he can get after the last month was almost rejected at a disappeared state street of his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shot him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have severely met Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coasts every year.
The number has declined about 90%.
In Russia, travellers and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recovered.
They count on a late isolation storm at the Mediterranean.
This week, the public television was prognozed by the balanced fruit and vegetables, soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti stated: "Tourists are there for a long time, tomates here long."
But the chairman had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is on the western whee, since it considers its reaction to the requested overtake of power weak response.
This is the continuous role of the EU access negotiations and Putin, which is able to benefit from the cold vote and to reduce the relation of Turkey to the West.
The Russian Governing Boss wins a bonus in Ankara in security because he requested support for the selected State bodies after the requested State bodies.
For Moscow, it is evident that it is self-comprehensive that even has a deep seat in front of the regime changes.
The gipfel meeting in this glorious Palace on the Sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as a analytical described, to present "Alliance of Foreigners": two countries who were deterrented and deteriorated from the west and feel badly treated and now associated.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The greatest difference is where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey have undergone the opposite sides.
It may be fascinant that after almost three hours at first talks both Presidents at the press conference said that they would not even have signed the subject.
The President of Turkey was obviously avoiding answer to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to submit to them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found.
But after months of open enemies - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey abschosed the Russian battle - it is certainly better that the two heads of the state at least again talk to each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS mark will only be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the bank's head.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS mark was connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
Since eight years ago, the Bank has been remote when it has had to be almost collaborated and saved.
At that time, marking strategies "RBS" have been used to make other final consumer finance marks.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to delay more national marks in the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentral main seat and the borsen notation will be changed to NatWest.
Mark Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and North Ireland.
There are other smaller marks for the business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's military bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The RSB mark will be to our investors mark and to the mark under which our employees will be employed, since we now become more a mark bank."
When the bank himself became a global mark, RBS became a global mark.
Now I say we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these marks will be in their own communities for something perfectly different and our staff will work with the customers under these marks.
RBS has already said that his six-nation sponsoring will not be continued and that it will increase the sensitivity of the different marks in sport-sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the Bank of Marks, because how can we go inside (we've asked) to do this to a better bank for customers?" said the Chairman.
It would have been very cyclical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can restart these marks, so I think the time is coming.
Frankie Dettori reached predilection his 3.000 wins at Newmarket
Detori sprinkles champagne after a double at New Market that brings him 3.000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000 British winning at Newmarket on Friday.
He set on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local round lines with a second win of the night a milen steel.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milen steel in the floor.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-year winner detector who wined the Ghayar said, "It's something awesome."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened in Newmarket because I've been landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 200,000 people.
I'm easily and very humble.
Detori takes the jubilee when he gets the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has reached more than 4.300 wins in a recorded car.
Lester Piggott, the nine-year-old derbysiers had 4.493 Karéesige
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the moderns and it is not surprised that he has reached this milenstein that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellectual that distinguishes it from the others in weight control room.
He is a fantastic newsman for running, his enthusiasm and Charisma enjoyed Fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already received 6.000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tourning jockey!
Frankie has already handled almost 30 years of winners, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British run, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milenstein with a typical flight dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been spent two years along with the britain's floor.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament wins, his famous "Glorify Seven" in Ascot 1996, but he also survived a flight failure and received a prohibition.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed a impressive characteristic strength to despise his two-folds and return to his best form.
And he is not long at the end - Detatori said earlier that he wanted to continue in competition until at least 50th year of life.
Russian Putin feeds the staff leader Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his staff boss Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the strongest confidence circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transport matters.
A opinion of the Kreml states that Putin, without indicating reasons, "the release of Ivanovs from his duties as president of the Russian Presidency".
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's representative since 2012, was too appointed followers.
Vaino, 44, is an ancient diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the Estonia capital Tallinn, he concluded the renommated Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and in the message in Tokyo.
On the creml site it means that he was later the register head and staff of the government staff.
About his name he said to Putin: "It is for your trust."
I think that it is the main task of the Government to undermine your activities as a ruler of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions.
Putin shared the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Do the laughing faces convince?
This step has made Moscow secrets.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the most trusted Vladimir Putins and like him for the Soviet secret service, KGB.
As a staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was exploded in television, both men claimed that the boss returned to his own desire.
But despite the laughing for the cameras, there are only few convinces about it - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So here is the result of a kind of power fight?
No one knows that now.
However, the official claim - that a man who was at once approved as a potential president wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy once - was a great scenario.
In his comments on Putin, quoted on the creml site, Ivanov said "is true that I asked you to start in 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compulsory posts for four years.
I have been president of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Vice-President and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as a representative.
As Putin obtained the power, he called Ivanov as one of the five people whom he trusted most of them.
One was assumed that Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putin's second official period since a strict period of office of Putins would have violated the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another, nearby United Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became the president before he returned to the president three and half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson's promises after he struck the product
Gibson was shared in a corporate exhibition at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABCÕos and CBS Television, producing the series, announced its announcement in a common opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hóner, apologized himself on Thursday before the announcement of his announcement.
At Set, there were artificial differences and a difference of opinion.
I repent the case," he said in a message.
Details about how the character Gibson from the series followed by a FBI agent team will be published at a later time, according to the opinion of the ABC and CBS Television.
The 54-year-old playing in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with them since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal Minds and have entered my whole heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a report published on Friday.
I had hoped to be at the end, but it wouldn't be possible now.
I would simply like to thank myself with the authors, producers, showers, our wonderful crew, and especially the best fans you can only want for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelve staff is set up on 28 September.
Country about fish landing in gardens in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff requested aid in the Implementation of the fish, which appeared in a garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that it could be the 75 sandals fish that were spent by a spring source.
Mr. Bain, who published about 500 meters from the sea of Lee, on Periscope a video of the species in the hope that someone could cast something light on the appearance of the two pounds long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Brent now connected to fife
The £ 1.35 billion project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the north cover of Queensferry Crossings to the viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It is the first of the four conclusions of the "deckboard" that draw close to the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge of five is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
He has over 100,000 tonnes of steel and 200,000 tonnes of beton and 46 rounds.
The £ 1.35 billion project will be completed until May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown has made the building of the building station today, and he was one of the first ones who went from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a real epicological measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of beton and steel used only for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the brake deck is a high activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passion.
In total, almost 79% of the whole bridge deck are at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a betonus for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Brie Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milenstein for each breast project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future high- and depth building.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection to the northern turm cover in the building, we had to close the still existing streets on the northern or country side.
This has been reached by dragging the northern supplier bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very heavy activity.
Massiv, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weight about 6.000 tonnes and needed to be used at an increase of approximately 3 % above.
Heikel, since the tolerances to which the team went were victorious - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Rescue in the Moelfree Bay: Three men have "lucky to be still alive"
Three men have "lucky to be still alive" after they were made by their fisherman's ship.
The Moelfree RNLI salvation station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to swim in security while their ship moved from their own power.
"We saw the ship turning around and presenting us the worst," said the leader of the Saving station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happy the strong winds have already weakened the ship out of their river, until we have left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fisherman, while the man was shopped in 60 years of age and found on a boat with no salvation western.
They all came to the board of the coast rescue ship and were brought back to the salvation station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into water have happiness to be injured and still alive.
Although the boat engine has passed over a nostopplein, it solved himself at the center of the ship from the person who controled the ship.
Somebody's waiting for these men today.
Severe damage - a man comes to his former friend
A man attacked his former friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a master and heavy hurt.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized acts are in the middle of his former friend's clothes.
When these came to the apartment, he got on her twice.
The 44-year-old was hurt in the hand and in the body.
The police could arrest the agent.
When the 50-year-old was clothing his ex-friend, he called his mother.
This warned his sister.
Along with her companions of life, the 45-year-old wanted to relax her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lifemates.
On the street, they met the ex-life friend of the man.
When the two women reacted to the apartment, the 50-year-old put his sister on the side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds Braunschweig's favorable apartments?
The SPDs and Green think that investors will be taken to the obligation in the future much more stronger.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments in the next years?
The SPD proposes for the next meeting of the Council a "Housing Concept".
But fighting is planned.
First of all, the question is: Who will build the favorable apartments?
A scheme is missing until now.
SPD Fraction President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the green: whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 per percent of all apartments as social apartments."
However, the favorable apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the big controversy point in the road is, so Bratmann, "What about investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10% on such areas, but at least 20% of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban building progress programme, which will be costed and need to be financed, should provide for encouragements.
The problem, so Bratmann, "There's no agreement between the groups yet."
The CDU wants investors to make a few rules as far as possible.
The left will still have investors' places.
Unless it is, so Bratmann, the situation in the apartment is deteriorated.
If the action concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's not clear whether we'll get the experts.
However, the programme is not complete: for about 1260 new apartments should be built without it.
How, though, is the loss of more about 1300 favorable apartments that will be helped in the next years?
Only until 2020 will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, so the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm should now get outlined links from the city.
○ Return apartments to the price binding should be followed.
This is possible in the West City.
On a shock, the problem was resolved.
Because in the West town they run to the end of the year.
At 1800 apartments you could get back to the price bound for favorable apartments.
Only: This does not want the owners, the building companies.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City will be drasticly increased, it will be removed from the aim of the so-called mixture.
A convergence of social weaknesses in only few cities should no longer exist.
The Green think that there will be still a move in the debate.
Group President Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the ship."
Even though they could have been able to build on more buildings for infamily houses.
But it doesn't mean that a compromise can't be found yet.
Pokemon Go, a jail for health and happiness that rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
That youth and child are not going to play anymore, but it is much more preferred to carry out their free time to look on screens, it was complained by many in the last year.
At Pokemon Go it is to leave people from the sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and recently on artphones.
Therefore, it is wonderful to see that technology and A’s freedom are not excluded.
I, of course, refer to the Pokemon Go-Wahn, an application based on the characters that were created for video games in the 1990s (after this occurred a character series, game cards and other spin-offs).
How many phhenomenes of the Popkulture were interested before the game was published in the United States, Others and New Zealand beginning July.
The market introduction into other countries was moved by the massive request that the server overloaded.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost so many like Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly said, the players go outside with their artphones and search for Pokemons that are followed with a GPS and, as soon as they were found, can be taken "fotographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wall and springed for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that returned the "medium" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that follows 35.000 users, recently the Washington Post told that within two days after the marketing of the game, the number of followed people who trained 30 minutes each day from 45% to 53%.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokemon Go - it only sees the RAW data to increase the performance.
Public declaration campaigns for health, who want people to take time for "30 minutes", "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" put on deep ears because many public messages of health are long-term and come from people who look painful.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
Who regularly treats sports, reduces his chances of disturbing cancer or depression.
Body certification helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to show them here.
But the wonderful of Pokemon Go is that it brings people to do something in freedom that makes them fun.
Three columns of health are therefore covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight and fun.
Some people close even new friendships on the jail.
As always, there are more married players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's going on?
There's been a break.
Even if the artphone apps like Fitbit were able to follow our A's earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.
The new will lose his journey and use will be left with time.
As a result of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games to join apps and reality with the real world's activity and will help many people on the jail to be active, fitted and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in the dament tours
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is on all this immune.
Dynamic on the knight.
Unfortunately on the bar.
The breathing night on the ground.
On the whole line.
And now, finally, the olympiatic.
The 19-year-old tournerin revealed on Thursday the additional fight title and increased the loop between himself and the world before all the eyes under the light of the olympics.
The total result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and the "Final Five" human cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronzemedal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the swimming board during the single maritime battle final of women in the Olympical Sommer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Tuesday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a additional war title and at all the fifth, while she claims to be the best of their generation or even at all.
She split in trees when her final result was shown and her long travel at this moment ended.
This success sets it in the same Liga as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, which brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sports type, 15 world masters medals - ○ 10 gold medals - with such a wonderful exercise that includes a mixing of honour and precision that the olympian Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tourner that I have ever seen."
It expected her a last trial in Brazil, a competition that did not so much between Biles and the athletes, but much more between her and a burden of overdimensionated expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.
The American girls Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman seemed to be hungry after they won each gold and silver in the single maritime battle finals of women in the Olympical Sommer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Billes took the first medaille on Wednesday while she served as a call mark at the breakfast of the home co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Billes was on it, while their long way to the top, never planned the future, it is not really true.
A part of its earthquake - which contains its typical tumbling pass - is voted on Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a case.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a child and discovered by Trainerin Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the tournale, was in force.
Since summer 2013, she has no longer lost additional competition, a winning series that will be stopped as long as it wants Biles.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two rotations, draw the picture.
Swimming bars and ground tours - in which the cars hold the world master title.
She recovered with 15,433 on the swimming bar and set another on the ground with 15,933.
Raisman obscured her well when they expected her final result - a pure formality - and trees flowed on the cars lightly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision that she had been described in her collection book became real.
The performance of Raismans was a race for the last time four years ago when she struck about the place, but the Bronzemedaille went in a tiebrake of Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old community, called "Oma" Americans, had a predecessor.
After her land exercise, she dropped to the public cousin, overwhelmed by a comback that sometimes occurred doubtfully.
With regard to Biles, the quickly spreading secondate of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new importance:
Police: 3 victims in series of murder cases when you hear music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since one year in the first case of Phoenix's series murder, while they were talking and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an input, the authorities said.
The staff fired eight shots from a hand-feeding weapons while he stood on the car's traveling side and then fled with another vehicle, it is read in the report.
The police reported that the three-fold murder seemed not to have been the result of a rape accident, since the royal officer did not take the bags or $2.900 in possession of one of the raised victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooter had led the investigators to become closer to whether she was connected to four previous attacks.
In general, in Spanish residences, seven people were killed in nine attacks and two other injuries.
"It happens in a residence before a house," shared Howard of the KHPO, a daughter company of CBS, beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspicious has used several vehicles, a brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and died later because of her damage.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah dies still in place.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted a half hours before the three-fold killing on a empty pickup-track, and it would be said that it was the work of the series murderer.
Explorers found patrons and secured a ball from the seat and bottle fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a six-year-old with a microsephalie: "It'll be better"
Like most of the 6-year-olds, Edmund Pi ́uto sing, players, and of course his mother.
But as the least of his elderly companions, Edmund microsephalia, the result of a genetic sight of which his mother Elizabeth Pi ́uto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, it was my first idea, I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't let it happen.
What's not right -- of course, it's been done on it," she said.
Your husband and Vincent were told that Edmund would never be able to recognize her in circumstances and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institute him.
"My first answer was "I didn't know that people were still doing," said Pi©uto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit down or crab until a year of life, and he could not yet speak.
But he makes slow progress.
He can run with support and drive.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the signs that Edmund has exposed for "sing something before me".
"We will teach him characters," said Pi©uto CBS News.
But there's no typical character -- she says. Edmund has found some characters alone.
Microsephalia has a number of causes: genetic, such as Edmund, and virus infections such as mass or Zicavir during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognoses can vary strongly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the insects with the Zikavirus.
Pi^uto refers to the emotional price of an unknown future.
I always asked what's going on?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know it.
I haven't asked for the predict for a long time because I don't expect her to tell me someone really.
But Pi°uto has a hopeful advice for mothers of kids with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain cases, overflow gives opportunity to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and great surfaces in Louisiana force the Governor to call the need on Friday. It will be calculated over the whole Sabbath with more rainfalls.
A number of rivers in the south-east of Louisianas and south of Mississippis overflow their ears and threatened to extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards shared that State officers are in constant contact with local authorities and are already in the way of help to the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation of the Governor, told that the requests for highwater vehicles, ships and sandshops were multiplied.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa community would have requested thousand sands.
A surface warning system is used over many parts of the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it reliable that there could be 3 to 5 pounds of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flight warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the mobile area.
The Fluss Committee in the nearby Baton Rouges and the Fluss Amite near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will find all the probably over the weekend records.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could overflow many houses in the preventions near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a streamwark-oriented overflow in Ascension Parish represents a person, since these rivers will only fly slowly into the Lake Maurepas.
The Fluss Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever opened on Friday at 09:00.
Rescue teams have still bound people from the floor water in the areas of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which usually is remote of more than 400 feet from house, has grown strong over night.
He said he would have warned him another son of a bitch who lives near.
"We are wake up and the water streamed and streamed in," Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife, Hansford, said she had never seen such an elevation of the river in the 48 years of her life.
Hansford said he and his family members had all obstacles, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that the helpers had saved all three in a large military LKW and brought them to the next fire guard to Gloster, where they were subjected to Friday.
Krautmann said that the surplus had "expanded me quickly" because there were still difficult rainfalls and that the authorities were taking into consideration evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer near Livingstone from midnight to Friday reported about 13,75 pounds of rain tomorrow.
Krautmann said that the ground has been significantly completed by the rainfalls since the middle week.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfalls and road broadcasts caused the salvation of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational accidents in five school sites.
The CBS daughter senter WWL reported that a companion in Tangipahoa 200 broke houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which now have been overcome.
The chief of the assembly of Robby Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven animals who were bound by the highwater.
In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergencies were set up to attend the evacuated.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the Tangipahoa community, nearly two duzen streets were closed due to the highwater, and sandshops were provided for for the people who hoped to keep the water from their homes and businesses.
"The last big overflow we had was in March," Lacy Landrum said by the city manager.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countium said that it continued to rain at the golf coast.
According to his information, a handful householder should be reported as overwhelmed on Thursday, but no reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, Manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, le日 for 40 years in the area.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "from bottles shield", overlooked shooter in Philadel_a
The police shares that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelia, this week already the second time a six-year-old child will be shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadel·a as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents suggested that Brown had several shooting damage, in the lens, legs, arms and bottles, but that he was at transport to the hospital at consciousness.
"His grandmother Delores Melendez shared the sender.
I can't believe that.
The status of the boy was critically considered in a hospital and he had to take several operations.
The child's family told the sender that he would probably be healed again.
He should have started the first class in a local basic school.
Brown was one of the four persons shot in Germantown.
At the same time, three men were shot: two in 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the two other victims are according to CBS Philadel·a in stable state.
The boy was found shot at the president of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police was just determined whether one of the vulnerable men of the acters could be.
Explorers shared the CBS Philadela that it seemed to have come to a cross-feeding between several sprays.
Patrons for storm weights, followed to various storm weights, overseeed the tatort.
It seems that it was clearly being a suspicious battle.
On the street, both sides of the road, there were shoes.
So there seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively shared," shared the policehouseman Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadel_a to the sender.
There were also several households and vehicles in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports according to the monitoring video.
On Wednesday, another six-year-old girl was met by a host on the arm when she played before her house in the residence of the West Oak Lane.
She's repeated and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I'm presenting under the female olympical mastership in the tour and this for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have been with each somerolympiade and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this manship has three tournaries, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who acted inspiringly for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this manship, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish, and Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, makes every one proud.
This community finally reflects the United States.
It has defeated the black and spanish women's presence at the top of this sport species.
In the last four years, the number one under the female tournerines was an afro-amer.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympics games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising olympical winner and American jubilee.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world master Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they offered unexpected, but mostly gaystictics.
On Wednesday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won in a individual multi-fighting event for women Gold.
Aly Raisman wins silver.
We experience the top of this sport species, but this does not look like tour classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie killed all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it in the olympical team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next olympian community will only have four tournaries in the community. This is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.
But the reality seems that the tours are a fair sport and tourners appear first in private tours that will be maintained by parents for training, installation, road clothing, competition and hotels (for the trayers and their tourners and families). The list can continue.
The majority of these tournaments are located in a well-heavy forests that can undermine the business.
In these units, the tourners receive their whole training and this is a tremendous and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they have started with the tour.
We have to enable the communes even innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to enable a more flexible and easier tournament.
I found my tourist for 20 years.
In my events, we offered free and difficult tour in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban youths (in particular black and spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-qualitative tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this beautiful olympical sports type.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, dissimulation and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers long-term benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this manship that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tour and that's great.
It's so important to share in sport, especially for girls.
It's a so exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the olympic mastery gold and thanks, making so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to begin their way to become healthy, strong and young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have refused Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to stop the fight against the changes by adopting a reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Property, but 58 Pro of the 37,000 assistants who voted on a choice rejected him.
In July, Hunt plans had enthusiased to introduce the contract forcedly and said that the NHS would be in a "nobody" country and that any other delay would be damaged for the employees and patients.
The first assistant will receive a new contract containing amendments to night and weekend work in order to improve the care of ungast time.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Committee on Assistance Dr. McCourt last night, shared in a communication with: "Assistant doctors have the proposed treaty to the proposed treaty, in particular that it is increasing the current population crisis and will prohibit the right to treat all doctors."
Only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress must be made and the time is expiring.
Efforts from the BMA to solve disputes through interviews were to participate in the Government on resistance and sometimes on the weight of ears.
That happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made the last month about his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, resume the force and respond to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he doesn't do this, the doctors have made clear that they are ready to carry out further work fightings.
The last strike finally ended April saw an exhibition of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since hospital sisters and doctors were included in order to provide doctors on the streek post-case covering.
The Ministers had hoped to stop the fight against the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the functionaries of British Medicalisation.
The BMA wants a better weekly payment for the 54,000 assistants under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Workers, urged the assistant to end the streek.
Mortimer said, "The work fighting measures are not only a little but they are charged with already overlooked teams and service officers and prepare patients, careers and their families only for concerns, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistant Doctors and have responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other Ministers on the thoughts on the prehumanity and whistleblowing.
The employees hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending, flexibility in education, additional training for those who returned from a timely time, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational plan, training vacation and genderly special salary cases in the medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of the employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health on the compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the heart infarct risk
Thousands of heart infarct patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities recommended to give this more people for a longer period.
Remembering medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart incidence in persons with heart disease.
The medicine has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a slaughter case or other heart incidence.
The NHS regulatory member NICE recommended a four-year receipt to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory member NICE recommended a four-year receipt to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
$140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of it suffers another heart attack or a slaughterfall.
Heart infarctions and casualities are caused by collections of fat-containing materials in the arterious walls that constitute places.
If the plague breaks one another, it can cause a blood disorder that stops the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart infarct.
If the blood disorder comes, it can flow through the blood flow and hide the blood flow to the brain, which causes a slaughter accident.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to another risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and exposed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it more unlikely to develop blood origins.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends a 12-month receipt of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a two-fold daily aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Evaluation Assessment area, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of those who have suffered a heart attack, another heart infarct or a slaughterfall - often with disturbing consequences."
It may have significant negative effects on the life quality of a person before a renewable heart attack.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in the reduction of further heart incidences and slaughter cases in people who have already had a heart attack.
By a temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are glad that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficiency and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blooding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness allows choices in Muslim areas
The former citizen of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman has been removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from the office
A culture of Political Correctness has led to a wide range of electoral disorders in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles commits the police, electoral observers and advisers to ignore the evidence of choice misuse due to "ethnie and religious insufficiencies".
The former Ministry of Integration and Communal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the enhancement of electors from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off lock bands outside election cabins to switch the electrons.
He recommends the electors to bring a proof with themselves to demonstrate their integrity in elections.
At the time, a chooser only needs to call his name and address.
The report proposes to open non-remote tissue on a person's finger when they give their choice to prevent someone choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He requests the press to have more access to Community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"It is not only against choices, but also to sing the communal government before the larger corruption and financial deterioration culture that comes to it," he said.
The report was assigned by the Downing Street as follows of the Tower Hamlet's election Chandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court was determined that the official citizen Lutfur Rahman should be discovered after a Lithania's corrupt and illegal practice of his office.
The Court concluded that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a Chinese way and that he would have caused his critics with racism and islamophobia accusations.
Rahman wants to "veve his campaign on the basis of that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 voices were doubtful or the result of a follow-up in which a person chooses other than someone else.
Sir Eric said there are evidence of damage throughout the country.
He was particularly alarmant to the disgusting letter election - in the elderly members of the Muslim Community would have pressed people to choose a candidate of their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the election system, to the leader of evidence to prove the integrity
In the report states: "On the evidence that the pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladesh background.
"There was a reminder that... State institutions would have ignored such a behavior because of "politically correct" supereconomists in relation to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system, to prohibit that political activists edit letter election documents to stop "waveers".
The report that Theresa May is in charge also requires stronger registration checks to prevent the selection of immigration and social disorders.
Consider options to ask the chooser before choosing for your release.
Use not remote tissue on a person's finger immediately she gave her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.
to carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on requests to a automatic letter choice.
It is prohibited that political activists edit full letter choices and conversions of letter choices.
The police shall be able to set up locks for election.
An amendment that facilitates an accusation of injury under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People Translation Act 1983).
Prohibition of photography in Elections.
Request that only English can be used in the election (excluding Wales).
Intensity of training to ensure that the employees implement the rule that electors are going to the election cabin.
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it "wonderful" that, after the Tower Hamlet's case, there was no penalty.
"The election judge has explained that Lutfur Rahman and his representative for a Lithania's reason for corrupt and illegal practices are unfair," he said.
It was due to a number of reasons for adequate, in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure, responsibility.
He also criticizes the ineffective "affect controls" of the elective registration offices of the Council.
Sir Eric said, "The Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as Parliament's mother, is a proud inheritance, but the worrying and covered spread of choices and lying of some authorities threaten this good call.
Insane after Kate's Radler double passenger and other famous dual passengers of Olympiasporters in Rio
Fans of the Olympiade 2016 in Rio have been handled this week about the French Radsporter Pauline Ferrand-Prevot other than Rand and Band, which has shown himself as an impressionant dual walker of Cambridge's herogin.
But the 24-year-old olympionickin is not the only one that is to fight with gold, which shows his own famous duplicates - not at least if you can give the social media faith.
To honour the Olympics games in Rio and all the famous faces that at times flirt on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of olympics that show more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood praise.
The jailer and the Wolf: a member of the US people in the boy shooter Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with the DiCaprio
Besides Kate's double traveller on the roadway, many people on the Internet show how a certain bogue could be the dualing of A-Promi° DiCaprio.
The member of the US people in the boosters Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after photos on which he looks unheimly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the Bogen’s feelings have been joined in the social media and admitted that he has heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see myself a great similarity, except the face-bearing," Brady shared the Huffington Post.
"He's a good looking guy, so I'll put it up as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will, of course, be the center of this year: the advanced comparison between the British Greg Rutherford and the popular player Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian Turnerin Aliya Mustafina with its big, expressive eyes will be able to walk as double passenger for the cuban-American song Gloria Estefan.
And the South African swimming Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gone: This user is the view that Nathan is the "atletic version" of the Inception Viewer
Another persistent comparison was made between the Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and Josh Hartnett viewer, which shows similar severe eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medailer Yulia Efimova highlights more than only the sun-coated skin and blonde hair like the shower McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was confirmed by Fans to identify a "atletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Steady Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter looker Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others had the similarities too.
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained their satisfaction that "the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
Actually, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter looker Jennifer Carpenter have a very similar face and eyes.
Additional popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and its beds that are almost identical to the guilty winner in the tour of Gabby Douglas, which shows her own beautiful, wide beds like Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commenter for the Olympics games is excused for his statement that the Chinese wheat "as a wheat died"
Byron MacDonalds Analysis about the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m free-style staff spectators of the CBC Live transfer of Olmypical Games in the middle-week
The Canadian sender CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming woman was "come mystery" and during the run, as "a swine died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free style staff.
MacDonald, who was brought to the CBS comment team to provide more "color", could be heard saying, "This 14-year Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, he went out like a meal, died like a wheat.
Thank you for.
The Chinese swimming woman Ai Yanhan, 14, weeped the second step of the swimming staff 1:57,79 - 1,61 seconds slower than Canades Taylor Ruck, which enabled Canadians to shut up the swimming to China.
Viewers throughout Canada reacted quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmet Macfarlane twice, "Has the CBC commenter just said that the 14-year-old wheeler from China "as a dog died?"??
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free style staff for women: "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and heavy, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not stop when they heard the insensitive Byron MacDonald
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, lived for the comment of MacDonald and said, "We are sorry that the comment has been exhausted for a swimming force."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, it's sorry that it's done."
CBC apologize over 90 times at the end of people who responded to the comment on Twitter
The comment colleague Scott Russel had to apologize in the name of MacDonald
CBC copied and endorsed his excuses for more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about the comments of MacDonald
The network also apologized quickly and gave a message.
We honestly suspicious that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be exhausted.
We've quickly apologized to our viewers on sending and our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one, Byron's comments are based on the performance of the swimmer and not on it as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately selected formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the sending and tried to justifie his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be expressed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I had made after the female olympics in the CBC Olympissation, he said.
"I've been on the service of the swimming woman and not on her as a person."
Of course, no disappointment was intended and I'm sorry."
Buyer in Primark is concerned about a woman who tries to be understood in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman went out their clothes in a prize to try underhouses.
To deteriorate the situation, she had to look out there, pulled out and restored her to the regulal.
She continued and tried four subhosen in a business in Bouverie Place Incups room in Volkestone,
The Primark Business in Bouverie Place Incapslum in Volkestone, in which the woman tried the underhosen before she put her back to the regal
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried to get the underwater, "he turned back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of underhosses from the exhibition, dropped her own shops and hoses and tried them.
" She didn't even try to find a little more discrete place to do it-- she just stood there, freshly like Oskar."
"Each one looked when she went out the underhouses that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back into the rule."
She repeated the same with three other subhoses before she finally disappeared that she didn't have anything to do, rejoiced and went out.
"It seemed not to sing that she observed someone - or think of the person who would buy the underhoses under circumstances that she had attempted."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who was in Kent le日, said: "How contrary to think that someone would take a underhoss with a person who had a different person who wasn't washed."
The case occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "When I got together, the employees tried to get the clothes out of the sale after she went - what's right."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underhosen and find out that another woman was stuck her and went out again, and they weren't weakened."
A speaker of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the event that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in our peoplestone."
All products in question were made from the sale.
How to get in front of weapons attacks with K_BAR_Maga
The world outside is a yearly place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the K_BAR_ Maga Verband in New York, to find out how to go around at close distance with weapons.
No matter whether you are close to you from front or back, this video will show you how you turn the shooter to your rider.
If you get close to you from behind, you should turn up first, so you can see your chair and "become me out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbogue.
Take him with the knee into the street and turn him back while the rider is assembled before the pain, the weapons from his hands. Snap him with the run into his face and move back, while they put the gun on him.
At the railways that come near, the technology is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapon and turn it, so the rider can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and shoot the rider on the bridge, then turn the weapon out → Griff before they move back and put the weapon on it.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how it forms Mizrachi.
But remember that it's the most safe for a roof to give your money - unless you are not K' Maga Master.
Traveller Ian Wright shabs his tongue for a traveler in the most harmful places of Europe
A British traveler undergoing his immune system and wormflex to a serious investigation - by disturbing some of the most disturbing and selfish places of Europe.
Moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shaded his travel on a Euro-scain, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistability of his immune system.
Before each object was cut off, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it would be involved.
But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was some surprising results in the daylight.
The idea to delight the button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be absolutely abstract, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen pool.
On his travel through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts about the support of Darbacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, he left nothing that he stuck, more than a bad smile in his mouth.
Mr. Wright has been for testing the resistability of his darm by eating the world through his traveling and self-employed and wonderful things.
From public countries from trains to toilet boxes, the task of his immune system was definitively under a test
In the movie he said, "I was relatively uninquired about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and weapons."
In the movie, he was justified in any case.
The only thing he refused was a disturbing public toilet in Russia.
His sample range showed a number of Luminometers of more than 4000 units.
In comparison with this, the number of luminometers are freshly weakened hands less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to delete after its number of luminometers over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the journey film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This is the worst thing I shot in a toilet near."
There's nothing more crazy than that!
I'm not going to touch anything here because it's simple here.
The "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company represents Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support Darbacteria and immune systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Snacks and New Category Niko-Renmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended saying, "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in the health of darm will become a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about products only, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary film, we could provide more information on the consumer in a interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the rule of the movie, added: "Let me say that - I had lost my respect for Ian if he had leaving some of the things I have commanded him to be nice, like the real Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to highlight it and others, where this was pretty difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these smuggling leckeries on the movie."
In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84% of all requested milk acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of magic and darm and 58%, indicated that they used at least occasionally products containing adequate milk acid bacteria.
Associal family severe before deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A associated family left her social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £500,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were made after a long list of complaints from their presence in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked staff of the apartment company found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls show flatting lowers up, wood parts have been risen, M° has been stretched on the foot, and graffiti has been cut into the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that they are now in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, who for the house manager at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment wouldn't be restored anymore.
She said, "It was a absolute dream for people here, and I think people don't need to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into consideration because this present is not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is fatigued and her call is also.
The couple had three sons who lived intermediately in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had granted included streets fighting with baseball clusters, hosts of residents, misuse, trade and excessive crying, fights and flights.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the contract, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which are cut in circumstances, an old M ́ was found
In the presence in which the wood parts were treated in the past
Neighbors said that they saw them in the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing delegated her and her partners this week violently from the presence after she gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer.
The delogation was rejoiced by easier neighbors who said that their life was made for haughty.
One said, "They were afraid of no one."
We lived 20 years near them, and it was always bad.
The innumerable times we say to the police here are incredible.
"Tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We arose because it was so sad here - that's not us used!
Now where they're finally away, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have forbidden to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police was called regularly for 20 years
On the supervised side of the community house, M° and old games were understood
He adds: "It's a shame that it's forbidden by the citizen, every responsibility for her behavior and its family, because a delegation is always the last step that the Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extremely extreme, and they had to look terriblely at their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the members of the community who have come to us courageously and have made us get the information.
I hope that this development will be comforted for some neighbors and provide the message that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had spent too different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A disturbing matratz left in one of the rooms of the house after deloging on the ground
Workers of the house manager will now have to remove Mõberge that surround the house
2014, the police carried out a race in the house and found more than 70 g Cannabis and Waagen, Paraphernalia and Barry money in £700.
Skeldon received a money penalty after she had been guilty of the owner of a drage of class B in trade.
She claimed that the money for a burststone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident of life.
After they were without Obdach, Tanya and her partner will now live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Room walls of the house were disturbed with graffiti.
The police says she's gonna deal with towns who do not keep the household rule
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told that the delogation was a clear warning to the other citizens who did not keep the household rule.
"This is about those who think that they can behave without self-projects and those who have been harmed by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners in order to break our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are moved to Panik after a deep-leaving military beach
Solar worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the chock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion flight of the air traffic forces placed an incredible flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment of starting in the scared tourists to panic after a deeply deep jet on a full beach.
Dramatic video records showed how the military aircraft flew almost nearly closely over the solar worshipers on the strand district in Aveiro in North Portugal.
The accommodators sprang up when they understandingly began to make anxiety about the warmth of the dishes, without seeing what happened to them by the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidays that posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "There was really two times very deep over and there was a moment, as it looked like it would blow it out."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the surface and it felt like the flight would fall down on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were placed in panic when the flight came out of darkness and deeply fled
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the P-3C Orion aircraft pilot was on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and to flee so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that the Jet was deeper than usually flew because of the bad views of the surface fires in the neighborhood, but the air strike forces had been supported by the security at no time.
The surface fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese Festival country, in which four people came to death on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to flee so deeply that his view was limited.
The flight was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishership as part of the exercise

Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday around the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The catalysts arrive in Duell around the Spanish Supercoup outwardly against the FC Sevilla, and the backup grows three days later in the camp Nou.
The duplicate winner must, in the power measure, disturb the underlying European-League coffinist and governing champion, inter alia, to Neymar, who conflicts with Brazil with the olympical football tour.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing steps.
In the training, the German takes a band-shopping in the knee, with which at least the request at Barca is confirmed in favour of audio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen laws in Barcelona for two years about the status as a number one.
Coach Luis Enrique, on that point, declined to a clear decision and left Bravo in the Liga, but so Ter Stegen in the most other requests.
Before the first obligation of the new game time, the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness state of the manship that was humiliated in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4 on Saturday.
Even at 3:2 in the sample of Sampdoria on midweight, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced.
Sevilla again has the 2:3-decline after prolongation in the supercup against Real Madrid and stretched the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is up to 11 successes of the recorder in this order.

The latest non-Chinese on the top Olympia trapped was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Mom and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the seats and the time-outs, they had no coaches with themselves.
They returned to the tribes and left their guests alone in the right wet battle.
"The matches until here I've played for my country."
"I'm finally playing for me," Zhang said accurately.
After the party, gold and silver metal winners placed with the Chinese fashion.
The match himself was unexpectedly one-side.
Ma had 28-year-old enemies to fight only in the first set.
After that, he determined the temperature on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points.
By the surprise of Mom, the expected constant match was not developed.
Nevertheless, it was not enough to see breathing ball exchanges.
Mizutani wined the game about Bronze against the 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonow 4-year-old
The white-russians had an adverse damage against the German European Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, then in their treatment, had to be "letally" with bleach.

Donald Trump spacious ′' great problems in the election battle
The leading of the United States is committed by massive concerns, including the majority of them in traditional conservative states.
Presidency candidate Donald Trump has now granted weaknesses of his election campaign in the current Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the multimillioner, usually great and self-certain, expressed something like thoughts, as the correspondents reported.
After he has made 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the run, the doubts have now grown success in the fight around the white house.
"We have great problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Furthermore, if he had wrong reports about his candidate, he took his medium shelter again.
Republical Hochburgs
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
An investigation from SurveyUSA from June followed Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see Trump before, but not with the distance that is usual for the Republican candidates in the Federal State.
It is also the case of Ar ́na and Georgia.
In an interview of the sender CNBC, Trump answered the question how he wanted to stop the forest Clinton's: "When I did it until now."
And back: this will be "or" or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation.
He does nothing else but "to tell the truth".
If it is not rich for him at the end for political correction, if it's okay, Trump continued.
Then I'll return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Partie Trump would have threatened to impose money to support its election fight, it should not be able to present better inquiry values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress will want to be more armed.
Olympia: Three distress at Do-Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenia's lightthlets threatened after the second Do business in the Olympics games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a trial of disturbance at a do-control in the Olympical town, Kenya sent a tragedy home.
The International Olympical Committee shared the establishment of a disciplinary committee immediately in order to investigate the case.
A Chinese functioner had told that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympical village, had delivered an urin test under the name of the 800-meter driver Ferguson Rotich.
This was the team leader Kenyas reported by the Do-Controllers.
The worldwide IAAF association requested the IOC information about the case to stream up its own investigations, shared a IAAF speaker.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, IAAF will take an evaluation," it stated in a IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to Do's control station and has been issued as Ferguson Rotich, who has issued and signed the test," Kenia's Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was owned by the accreditation of the atlete, which was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Do Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became over 800 meters in Peking WM quarter in 2015.
Four days ago, the Chinese Leightathletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich has been removed from the Rio Games.
He would have informed his country's Sportler's money payments about the future Do-Tests.
According to media reports, he would have been arrested at the airport of Nairobi at his back.
Kenya has been specially observed at the IOC since a long time.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Dodo target controls set by IOC before the rio games, unusually previously noted that special athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into visa.
The World Anti Do Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti-do law and a functioning control system.
The law has been decreased a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia.
The WADA Kenia followed from the list of countries whose control is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenia is used as a large Lighter nation.
The lightthletes of the country won the most medal in the WM 2015 in Peking.
In a series of television reports of the ARD, it has always been stated that there is easily accessible in Kenia Do® media and that there should be a significant mentality of the sports traffic.
IOC-Mitglied Richard Pound requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had prepared it in the Russian light athletic.
It could be demonstrated that this sport species was baptized and systematic.
The Russian lightthlets were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburgers play the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a dramatic loving couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical obtains Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the music into the temple of the classics and fulfilled the role of Mary’s younger dream.
In the orchester grave, the Simón Bolívar Orchester under the leading of the venesonal director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.
We always say that it's very latin American.
There are many Latin American additives in their time and their melodie.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recept for our orchester.
I would say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this inscenation, Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She reminds her of her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and tanners.
Mary's role has always fascinated me.
First, because she's musically exceptional!
And then Mary's personality would be there.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's wise, of course also naive, and very suffering.
"You are very like me, my Italian character, which I have as Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the operan singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honour to work with her.
She's a fairly generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such a exceptional artist and very suffering!"
Direction is a need for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his face, it's his life!
It is such a big chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperature, a fire, a suffering and a joyous approach to life, which is very important!
For the Nazi Regissor Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" high-aktual: "In this piece it's about prejudices and fanatism."
Today, we have the refugees, then the Puertoricans went to New York, and the New Yorker people didn't want them.
They are the same subjects, and they are today as exciting as at that time.
59 years later, the track is still relevant.
London Schoolmade, who joined the IS, was killed inside
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British scholars who left London last year to join IS, died according to reports.
The lawyer Tasnime Akuniee said that their family learned some weeks ago from her death in Raqqa.
It was believed that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bollwork in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and she died after her family’s information shortly after she intended to leave the battled country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war area - to stop people from ever taking this decision," Akuniee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other scholars from East London ascended into an aircraft towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultan's family was informed that she married a ISIS warrior - and became widow within few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain as candidates for the Court of Justice in the case of a choice in Garland
Harry Reid, the leader of the democracy in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked activity from his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McCon日 believes that the next president will call the follower of the disrupted judge at the Master Court of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Garland to choose "with a certain measure of consciousness".
A speaker of Reid later said he hadn't talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't take care of injury with a new candidate.
Garland is the highest judge for the U.S. Call Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said the republicans blocked the Garland nomination as Lakaien and assistant of the Republican presidency candidate Donald Trump.
He also determined that Donald Trump was inadequate to the president's office.
Treats wants naked calendar for "women and men"
The Traats Magazine → together with the photograph David Bellemere to produce a 1970-year Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of topmodels for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The Chef of Treats Steve Shaw told us the beginning of this year that his naked magazine distinguishes from Old School Playboys, as "Playboy for Men".
I'm doing this for women.
It seems that he thinks that the calendar is doing it too.
"We must return to the presentation of untimeless and classic nakedness, in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a woman's body," Shaw said in a press report on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can enter their images online or personally at open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculates mass flight
"Who doesn't adjust and Erdogan lo ♫ sits on packed coffees," says the President of the Gulden-Neighbor's Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Kar'yun.
The Kurdish community Germany recalls shortly with thousands of protectors who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the middle-term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the Federal President Ali Toprak.
The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan, after the putsch trial, expects the Kurdish community of Germany to flee to Germany.
"I consider short-term with thousands, medium-termly with some hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Federal President Ali Toprak of the "Welt" on Friday.
Since the Government has overlooked Kurdish Hochburgs for months ago with penalties, 500,000 Kurdens were in Turkey to flee.
Following the easily puzzle, there are still s mundious and oppositional ethnic turkeys.
They will want to restart in Europe when they continue to be subjected to Turkey.
"It can't be that a State who takes up refugees in its own country produces refugees," said Toprak.
The boss of the band complained about the target of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alvitic cities.
This means that Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining courses.
"You are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been destroyed or destroyed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The boss of the curse requested that the Federal Government "will stand like Austria against Erdogan and his attachments".
Also in Germany there is a "Hexenjagd" against Erdogan Critici.
I'm not feeling safe in Germany for the first time in the past months.
The German branch of the Gul-Movement also prevents the fleeting of many Turkeys in the foreign country.
More Turks will seek asyl in Germany, especially Kurden and Oppositional.
The brand marking as Gulen Attachers destroys teachers and other academics the famous existence.
"Who doesn't adjust and Erdogan lo ♫ sits on packed coffees, as well as the chemalists and süllulars," Ercan Kar日yun, president of the nearby Gulden Foundation Dialog and Education, said "Welt".
As reported by the newspaper on numbers of the Federal Ministry, the Turkeys have already set the largest group of asylum authorised in Germany before the puzzle.
On Sunday, 30 June, this was 11,386 people, and thereby approximately 29% of all were recognised as asylum authorised (39.625).
In this highlight, there are no refugees from war, poverty or perspectiveness.
Asylum rights under the basic law are outside political, so from State side, individual persecutors.
Mecklenburg Proverbs: "Go to where it hurts"
Wonderful Mecklenburg forpommers: The inhabitants do not get anything from the Sommer-Walk Battle - and the holidays from Northern Rhein-Westfalen can't choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg's predominants, they understand.
2021, the country choice will not be located directly at the end of the summer festivals, and the Parliament has already decided to begin the year.
Because it's more bleeding than so far: summer vacation, hot, and land-day choice battle - it's going to be.
The inhabitants to be convinced by the electors are at the vacation.
The most holidays that are in the country are on the way of Usedom, Ruggen or Hiddensee are not homes, so they cannot choose the country day.
This is practical problems: In the holidays, there are helpers to stop the places, to broke airballs, to distribute flights and to count voices, just to ease.
By 4 September 2016, the election and the last holiday, Mecklenburg's prospects have to go on to the people once again.
The heavy phase, when you can say that at all, has just started.
And this is also something: President Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in question clearly behind the CDU.
It will be sparing how strong Newling AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 the Governing Boss, makes a almost inappropriate choice fight, seeing from his large places.
He travels through the country, splits roses and pleases a little with people, just as he has done his legendary wrestling preacher Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering has received cold feet and gives Canzler Merkel the responsibility for the debt of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your "We create this" has accelerated the growth of the legalists, which will now deceive the beautiful office.
The CDU with its candidate, Mr. Lorenz Caffier, has already learned how it is when you make a choice fight at the right place in the wrong time.
She invited the officer Angela Merkel twice to Grandcourts; Merkel is in the north east.
But the target group did not agree that there were more northern Rhein-Westfales, Berliners and Sachsen as Mecklenburgers and pre-pommers.
"There was probably the majority of other federal countries," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg, recently in the NDR.
But it also hurt no one from other angles of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU declines largely to the usual election campaigns on market sites and before purchasing with solars and airballons.
This, as cokert says, is just a "subordinated" role.
In addition, the Union has noted that it is in the country that it has to take a very much effort to find a draft to the people.
You are like the left, the SPD, the green: the wheat of the country is almost available.
However, the CDU electoral Council Cokert is also self-determining: "You must go where it is bad, namely where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday feast must be enjoyed."
Because many are on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a specially engaging election fight.
In question, the social democrats laid up more than 22% behind the CDU partner (25) and just before the Department (19).
At the election of 2011, the SPD was still clear with 35.6 Pro before the CDU (22).
The Green Party with seven Pro inquiries may create the run in the country.
They make from the vacation note a modern tuning and put their choice fight largely on the Internet.
"Online election fight," it is called the president of the country.
Otherwise, green electors are conducted on tracking for domestic voting citizens among the holidays.
Silke Gajek, the Spitzen Candidatin, just curve with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lake and still find it beautiful.
Their impression: "Work-Access in Mecklenburg-Vorpommers is not punishing."
B27-Saning: Guests suffer under sper.
There is nothing to mix with the ability to cure the B 27.
For the responsibility of building workers, starting at 5.30 a.m. to the end of 20 a.m., there is all praise.
"They have made everything pretty crazy," Elvira Tetzlaff said from the Jet tank.
It's a super team.
There's no move, too.
The building office could be moved planfully to south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October, everything was completed.
It will also be the result of the responsibility for building works, such as the establishment of helpers.
Since the building site has been migrated to the south and the sphere of the asperg street has also been revoked in obterdings and so that the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the stocks have relaxed within the place.
The citizens can now be able to re-consider both sides of the B 27.
It seems to go back through the location.
"There were partly significant complaints," says the responsible for the wrong-technical management of the sanation, the Master official of Florian King.
The residents of the streets, the roads of stone, the gateways, the gateways and the roads had to fight with more deficiencies because many bad roads were looking for and rather trusted in their navi than the decoration.
This caused some of the Lkw to be fresh in residence areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the community requested to strengthen the measurement vehicle from mixtures.
"There were significant transitions," says King, who told himself about the situation once.
There have been two to three per minute.
The most shot was with 77 hours kilometers in the 30-zone.
Since the building place has continued, it has become more silent.
For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again.
Looking at the cards, businessmen do not like.
But that the B 27 sanation has led to transmission inputs with them, let everyone asks.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Who has less to do with the "Endpoint", so produced for other companies, the sanation has no effect.
Moreover, in the car house of Maier, Thomas Sulz says of a "maximum easier decline", but it also agrees that "the latter is missing".
The most powerful are the locals at the street.
J. Albert Göhner, the inhaber of Steakhouse, forms of Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existing.
Not only him, but all guests have found it.
The customers were missing from hechingen, balingen and redweil.
We must be pleased with each euro turnover.
It refers to the inputs of transmission on "plus than 50 Pro".
The road sanation has "returned his operation for two years".
He had to leave the help of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had been released, it would have responded differently.
Instead, the Governing President Jörg Schmidt asked whether there could be a financial compensation, with the statement that the guests would benefit from the benefits of the situation in B 27. Now it must also be the results of the sanction.
Gönner knows about other country circles, where such a thing has been greater handhaw.
In all complaints, Göner is sure that his guests will continue.
The family operator has been assigned here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
That other staff guests now predict less often because of the complicated construction, he can understand.
If you can't get out, it's beautiful wherever you can't.
That his staff clients return after the end of the sanation work, Göner has no doubt.
Despite the crisis with BSE and birdgrippe, Göner maintains the impact of B 27 building works on his knowledge of the greatest crisis that has raised his guests in his long-term history.
Six months of building, that's brutal.
In the name of the terror combat, the laws are continually crying out.
According to the latest attacks, the Ministry of Interior de Maizière now presents a deep security package.
But what does a duration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the discharger.
All its proposals are "politically admissible to the coalition partner", says the Federal Ministry in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't forget anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed inside the parties.
I'll also share it.
However, as a minister of the Internal Ministry, he was on the results and on a "accessible consensus" within the coalition.
The Maizière, after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, has made a little time before presenting its conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, they are going to be more important now.
Something has already been announced, appealed: that a new security staff should take care of the knife of encrypted communication is not new.
It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU standards for flight data and weapons rights.
The call for more video monitoring and security staff is also not surprising.
In part, the Maizière starts a second step for proposals that have not been done with the SPD: He wants to put a sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and put the German pass on Dschihadists with double nationality.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man calls.
However, he thinks that it is worthwhile and doesn't ask anything that does not have any chance for coalition partners.
Some new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: he is planting procedures for dishes and more opportunities to capture people before the destruction.
Refugees that are obtained to the country should earlier check their artphones and open social media accounts for a security check.
In the duration of refused asylum applicants, he wants to make some even worse than even longer - such as those who commit criminals or who reject their papers to decrease their activity.
Some of these are political and legally heavy.
Some are still unexpected and make questions open.
And at some points - in the inequality of patients, for example - the question is: What does it do with security and terror?
Yes, the Maizière says it is important to distinguish between the subjects of refugees and terror.
But it can't be said that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
○ Many people were concerned about security in view of the high refuge numbers.
And things that people were deeply occupied have not been allowed to expose in election times.
The internal security is extremely focused.
First of the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brusel, Niza.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Insurance is big.
And yes, there are choice fights.
Therefore, the Union and the SPD remain in the position of internal security on the subject.
In the past days, there was a high range between the two parties.
Only a strong fight on the compensation of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some of the EU internal ministers, where the directors also request a Burka's prohibition and a dual nationality.
The Maizière also strives to reasonable sounds.
From a double pass, he doesn't hold anything.
We have satisfied the debate in Germany.
To re-open, don't be meaningful.
And in a Burka's prohibition, he has constitutional concerns.
If his own package is constitutional at all corners and if it is actually "mutable" for the coalition partner, it must be shown.
There are some things in which fighting could be done.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile inside security.
Participant Sigmar Gabriel only signals carefully speaking preparation and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increased security."
People's cars are still lying.
Despite diel candals, the supply numbers increase worldwide.
But not in all markets it runs around.
In the revocation action there is a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half-year delivery.
Although Europe's largest car builder can continue to make more, despite its many marks and some well-reaching markets.
However, in July, the Nuclear Mark VW was weak, especially in Western Europe, and it reloaded the total expenditure as it reported in the Dax noted companies.
Worldwide the VW mark sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 Pro > less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, to China, the second important market, the sales of 14 Pro were under the previous month.
In the household of Germany, the supplies dropped about nearly a sixth.
Marke operator Jürgen Stackmann brought the weakest numbers from July, especially to two sales days.
Moreover, in some nuclear markets, "modified economic framework conditions" have made a holding of purchase.
In addition to the situation around the puzzle trial in Turkey, the British vote to exit from the EU has also been charged by a speaker.
In the United States, where the outputs first scaled, there is also a minus to books.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected housemark of the Lower Axes continues to be flipped by the Diel Canal: after the first seven months, only a delivery min of 0.9% to 3.37 million vehicles are booked.
Concerning leader Fred Kappler could continue to provide a sales plan from January to July.
1,3 Pro’ more vehicles offered people's cars at this time, worldwide, 5.904 million.
Volkswagen was manipulated with a software outgoing test.
Only in Germany VW calls about 2.5 million cars for the workplaces.
During the turnover, VW confirmed that the construction of cars has no negative effects.
After the transportation of vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance shall not be affected.
The autobuilder provides the customers a "balance" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "garantie" as it was called in business circuits on Friday.
The reason is to be legal properties.
The "Focus" reported that Volkswagen would give his German customers a guarantee for surrounded diet models.
This would have been elected by VW representatives in the Federal Trade Minister last Monday.
The Department of Conference has confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to completely comply with my investigation committee and the KBA."
"Differences from it will not be accepted," stated the Minister of Federal Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
The VW has concluded that in the consumption of fuel, CO2 emissions or engine service after the recycling, there are no deficiencies and have unchanged stocks for all type-approval relevant vehicles.
Pops cars themselves use the term "garantie" but not as it was called in business circles.
In the large term "Garantie" people cars see the possibility for customers, for example, that a half-year after the conversion, with an engine damage to a workplace - and that could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Moreover, in customer interest, it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaustion canal causes insurance regarding possible guarantee schemes, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "garantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires rich sparers of future penalties - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Boss Joseph Paul said on Thursday, "It is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily accounts."
The Bundesverband Germaner Banken speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: normal sparers should "not be obliged to spend for their spargrose punishment".
Reserve banks money by night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to charge 0.4 Pro­tributes of penalty.
This tax requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of firm- and business facilities for investments over EUR 1000,000 on giro or daily accounts.
"The first 1000,000 euros are free."
"The next 1000,000 costs $400 per year," Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros since a short time, which could be removed from one day to the other and which he cannot value.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 Pro costs," said the bank head.
"I can't put 4000 euros for each million."
The costs will be continued after the consequence of the consequence.
The money simply leave in the treasures of the raiffe bank would be too important: "I've already learned four overfalls, I don't like the fifth!", said the bank proposal.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other facilities.
Only a few of them went away to other banks.
The Federation of Bayern stated: "The extreme monetary course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks."
It's to be too alone to be "facility not permanently possible".
Therefore, some German banks have increased their taxes for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for three million euros, the Türinger National and Raiffeisen Bank of Altenburg had made a shockline with their taxbank branches 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the main business leader of the Banking Board, said: "We don't expect the customers to pay payment for deposits, the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and sparcases."
A banker said that on the Tegernsee there was "a client that was more exhausted from the power."
"It can be a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money free.
The 1911 founded Federal Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Creuth and Tegernsee.
In the region lives showers, sporters and entrepreneurs.
The Federal Federation Bayern "no other banks are currently calculating a refund for institutions of customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Federation of the German People's Banks and Raifeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Congratulations, explained, on the end of June, "The swell, to go into negatively against the customer, is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the immigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not like this.
Destination Places: Who purchases shall disks?
Single men in the middle of the age love plates.
Before you go to a comment part to translate it under the Pseudonym NonAllEinsome MenMettlerenAlters with red advantages, this statement leads from the current data.
According to YouGov, the multi-speaking rebuilding of hall disks is not on a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to return to middle-life nostalgie.
Those who have recently covered a plate are all the perspectives of the age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely bought group.
It is also no horse by hobby collectors - it has a emotional importance: elderly players keep their feelings more for themselves (56 %/53 %) and enjoy spending time alone (69 %/66 %).
But are the results of YouGov?
If this blog had a news report in television, the camera would follow me while I was running in a busy street in Soho, wearing a modesty green boat and stealing wild before I stay, hold my hands and say something important as, "So, let us throw a closer corner on it."
So let's put a corner on it.
Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly involved in Charme - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one of independent sellers were seated - it is like a handful fantastic plate-special business.
I would be surprisingly asking the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part in which I stand directly close to various men in such businesses and try to appreciate their age and beauty by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (Data number: two young women, three men in the middle age) in the Reckless Records (Data number: eight men in the middle age, a woman, in the middle of the 20) is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, please?
"I guess so," he said.
I have approximately 3.000 or 4.000 plates.
These skies, pictured above (he sent me the shot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his room.
The reason why he had such a significant number of albums and Singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he was not able to allow when they were shooting and buying items that he bought when he was young and pledged.
"The many things I buy are from the late 60s, the early 70s that happen when I was 11 or 12s. things in which I was probably too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are more introverted and like to spending time alone, and f · to add: "I don't smoke and I don't have a lot.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25, who is at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he met are approaching the YouGov profile.
However, he also noted a new whale to people who are influenced by the mediahpe, people who have heard about the comback and who are encouraging to buy their old plates again.
Of the talks I have been conducted, people usually followed their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once bought their discs to buy themselves CDs now buy their CDs to buy their discs again," he says.
This would declare the tree to the adherents of a certain age.
But what about the emotional importance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that plattworks offer a refreshing community of similar persons.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took contactless payment system.
Some platforms feel overwhelmed from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of trusted scale plates, from objects that wake happy youth reports.
"I think, sometimes it can be the fashion of an empty or the property of material owner than a sort of comfort," says Wez.
It's with me as a collector, and I think it's in many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" A worker is out of a platelet stapel.
A survey of the ICM in April enth said that almost 50% of the people who have bought a plate last month have not yet heard.
The survey also discovered that 41% of a player that they never used, while 7% of those who buy a plate does not have a plate player.
At that time of the message report, I would probably look very worried, while I broke through a stapel on Bossa Nova Compil.
Jonny, 42, who in Sounds of the Universe (the number of data: three men in the middle of the age) has observed a "tropheen aspect" of the revival.
"Nothing came in here recently and said, "I don't want to play a player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead hall disc so that I could put it in the regulation," he said.
This is not a big progress, but it's definitive.
More productless, less musical.
We have people who say, "I have no plate player."
It's younger people, not older people who just come in slow.
Fopp, who has almost divorced a whole etage to the scale, has a greater public than I'm going in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists, making photos, teenages and women in the middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the preceding business - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop rather than experimental Jazz is driven from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity in customers.
No one of them seems alone, but the naked psychic traumata is hard to find when you stay about 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, runs in the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates to sell.
She's doing a shopping bullshit rather than a big cup.
She doesn't deserve much, therefore the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." it's driving with a loved seafzer.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last holding is a business of which it is said that a new generation of plate loved ones had to have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
When I seemed to pattern the Jeans-Hotpants, I saw a group of young teenagers who grouped for a moment for Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decided to buy a Crosley plate player.
To the left, there is a treehouse, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of modern music and classic, the main plates for a average collection.
No one looks at it - maybe because they are just clean decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to catch them.
It's pure "plain art".
But in view of that every attraction to these objects means more money for the branch and could send some customers to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprised that a population group who has more time and money than others is the one that is mostly exposed to luxes like plates.
Even when my research showed that the results of YouGov are voting, at least in plates in Soho, the large number of female collectors and players who exist in reality, plates and online fores.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
They will not carry their Thursday tomorrow with security with the bummel through the Berwick Street plates and the sheets through plates, while they avoid the staring angle of an insecure, 30-year-old false moderation, which will not take any strange men in the middle age over the sculptures.

The French Court rejects a boat on the abrise of businesses in the Dschungel refugee camp
A French court has refused a boat of the authorities in Calais to decline tens of provisional business and restaurants in the dschungel of Calais, where there are thousands of refugees.
In a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be authorised to reduce 72 provisional business in which persons in the stock, cigarettes to energy drinks, offer fresh service or tea for 50 cents (40 pens) or simple foods for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture Calais argued that these places should be reduced because they would be a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid and which would have a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important because the free foods offered by the State-supported union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also concluded that the provisional business and restaurants often would offer free food for people in need.
A court in Lille dismissed that there is no legal basis for the exhibition of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but claimed that the consequences of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely "complianceable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just men who live in "extremely prejudiced conditions".
He said that the areas offer adequate meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Netherlands travel was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which will be conducted in the Community, and offers 200 feeds on the day, English and French class, as well as a advice to asylum cases for the hundreds of protective, uncombined minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have undergone the petition to observe the kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure was "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the latest eight years of age."
The two assistant organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant assessed on Friday that the number of lives in Dschungella was increased to over 9.000 people - the maximum number until now - after a steady increase of newcommunists during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains warfare
Despite his disappointing occurrence in the Olympical Times, Radprofi Tony Martin would not be allowed.
"I continue to keep the WM in ́ck, stay reliable and continue fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before he arrived from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
A clothing for his miserable twelve place on the sugarhout he does not have.
"I feel honestly difficult to comment on the time of yesterday," said Martin.
He must analyze the reasons for debug.
At the time travel-WM in October in Katar, Martin wanted to fight the title.

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Dutch Raser must be set to the next generation of speedmakers: in various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new devices will be tested, especially effective, for the temperators.
For example, the futurely effective Enforcement Trailer of the Vitronic company from Wesbaden can be applied to accidental difficulties where it would be too appropriate for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is no need for infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary browser for the compliance with the speed limit.
A permanent mobile building, however, may be too earlier or outstanding.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: His battery holds five days on uninterrupted measurement, and the fall data will be encrypted over a dictionary.
In addition, with Laser mechanism, all vehicles can be taken on the basis of several tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits and transition prohibitions after hour, driving streams and vehicle class can also be monitored.
You can move the attacher with each car with an attachment bubble.
In order to not simply steal it, it is decorated in the middle, so the talkers in the pangsed and otherwise disappear.
○ an instructed alarm installation will make the higher front of vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic information in different federal countries and has also been used in the meantime.
Furthermore, foreign authorities embrace with the new technology: Young people have ordered France 100 pieces, after order of 150 pieces last year.
United Kingdom takes silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom at the 7th Rugby came to a broken stand on Thursday evening at the last hole in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 in the Deidoro stadium here in Rio.
Fiji granted a master class in action, side stapping, backs, line run and red power to win gold - their first olympia media of each color.
The degradation was discouraged by the not too bad comfort price of the silver media - British fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tour in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear download of the box, 7-5 in the half final on the same day, could finally fall back on them.
But, independent of it, Fiji would have put a 15-man team in a best form in this form.
It might be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former leader for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
Eight years ago, they lost each game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here she just lost one.
This sleep will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks of GBs from the pass.
It felt to Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in a driving bus. World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau broke in the corner.
With four minutes more game time, Jerry Tuwai had another attack from the right corner that he had converted.
12-0 and GB haven't touched the ball.
An amazing tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to get a gate, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua put a touchdown in the right corner, and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa feed a new one since the reanapiff and there was still over a minute of game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak tacklings of the GB team and struck up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion was a 29-0 to pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learned.
That's it.
GB took basic changes to half-time and the Fijian lamp... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed after a spectacular middleplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long for the South Sea Islands whose fans sang, sing and danced on the tribe.
It was not difficult to admirate the player approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame put the i-tube with another trial in the last seconds.
The Pfiff found that the Fijis were invading and GB kicked devastating in the races.
Earlier on the day Fiji Japan had overcome in the half final with 20-5 and the United Kingdom forced South Africa to a half-final math button from the British conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown spent the box in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A later tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the 15-Aside teams, protected the win - and so the silver media.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the tragedy to Rudersieg
There will be no emotional gold than these games and that will mean something.
From the first road to the last, 220 hard wheeves that enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a similar importance in their golden moment at Stacio da Lagoa.
Even if there were only the two who were sitting at the ruder, there were three voices in the ship. The echo of the Tra's Robin Williams, was alone when they broke to the second olympiagood in the two without taxes, followed the first women in the history of the British sport, which put such a measure.
Their domination was absolutely, always its 39th unexpected use, which is also without example.
What we see is two ions of atletics that slipper over the surface with the elegancy of wheat, which does not reflect the type of triumph to adequately.
At the back of every gold in the roads, a battlelon stood on voluntary helpers that contribute to the incredible progress that makes the subsection, and there was no helper than the tragedy that didn't know if he would survive this day at all than cancer.
Like he said he was risking something.
I had blasen cancer, which is operable, and they did that.
If you don't do that, he's going to get out everywhere.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It's a little changed the view.
Williams was deceived in December 2013.
The Trio had the luckyness that he was treatment in the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin what the interruption held to a minimum if it was in such circumstances at all the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go back soon.
It was an anxiety.
I was in the hospital and went to the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at one time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering on itself is a challenge, but it makes it a more greater.
In the immediate victory of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who made something more than other than a nervous morning, and so tried to process his own eggs.
Stanning, who was a headman in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a use in Afghanistan, said, "I was a emotional wrack this week. It may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have been doing.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks to him.
I couldn't want a better person to train or a better tragedy.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost runs in the past five years.
The couple had a hard rhythme with which their enemies couldn't keep.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve.
We were very imprisoned at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important that we do not let ourselves be mixed.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't going to do something great.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a result, go out and win the run that we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before decisions about his future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adjourner Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last run.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it was about six months to understand that I was a olympiatic.
It was all that new for me and I was so disappointed.
There's been about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years for example for clarity
The business leader of the "Gruppe of Birds", Ruppert G.G.er, is going to the rest.
The link is used as "exempled by the bairds".
A small French drinking water combination as an example of the large water product.
This was the name in the original tone in a contribution of the Bayerian ds.
Shortly later, the water forum of the Government of sub-Francs appreciated the target band.
The work of the feet stone group was "bayers as examples".
After all, Rupert G.G.er, who was 31 years in the destination of workers, was 28 years as business leader.
Now he was in the rest of 65 years.
The drinking water band of the Vettenstein group with a seat in Kottendorf, the community broitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and weilers with approximately 5500 residents.
Members are the communities of Kirchla, Breitbrunn, La日, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water supply contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunns citizen Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Gédér 1985 was established as a waterwater and has already been appointed as a business leader of the target band since 1988.
"His tasks have been very important and they have been exhausted from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, the budgeting, the calculation of taxes and contributions until the weekends of the need," said the President.
As a wonderful event, she called the introduction and introduction of the new sources (1994), the sales of the new sources (1998) and the deterioration of farmers, the sanation of the high-containers (1999), the regeneration of a central computer management (2004) and the part renewal of water guides.
It has not given any rest and you have always taken new renewals because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised God’s faithful, trusted and correct service over 31 years.
He has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his waterwearing connection and has regularly made the water wheelband as if it was his own company.
A few weeks ago, he has been able to present the successful concept of the Veterinary Steel Group on nitrate decreasing before the water forum of the district.
For that reason, he received very much recognition and praise.
Rupert G′er, on his side, praised waterwater Alfons Griebel, who had 28 years together with him.
He's the best waterwater and he was a faithful boy.
All together, we were an immortal team.
As high points in his view, he covered the source building and restructuring of the target band.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the brush at the high-case of Kirchla on 3 January.
Here you have to work at minus 17 degrees all night in order to provide the towns with water.
Even the supply of newbrun can be maintained only once because you are able to hold the pick of Pettstadt's high container with slaughter.
The operation of the drinking water band was transferred to Daniel Störmer from La日, which followed Rupert G日er.
The sopranistin Netrebko is open with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other parents concerned: "You must have the courage to talk about."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian magazine "Corèe della Sera".
When the illness was recognized in her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, has been well predicted and now learn privately in New York, where the best terapeuts are given.
"To give an example: If I ask him something about two years back when I sing at the Mayland Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he's the most happy man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She's now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargetheite - Man shoots on lifegrounds
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multiple family house in Bargetheite (Kreis Stormarn) and killed her.
"The man himself called with us and indicated that he had shot his lifemates," said a police speaker.
The worker is on the flight, and after him it will be publicly invoked.
Middleway, because Sven S. could be on the road.
The man is about 1,80 meters big, muscleless, breathed and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man's wearing a glass.
The man shouldn't be invited directly.
He's still able to get the weapon with him, like the police.
Whoever looks at Sven S., calls the 110.
The police speaks of a "relation state".
The victim is the year 1988, the acter of 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not wish to make any information about the access or the relationship between actors and victims; but she assured that a person was killed.
"It's a killer delict."
"We're not saying more now," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
Eye witnesses suggested that a special intervention command (SEK) was at the tatort.
Steel - light view for German steel industry
The crushed and energy intensive German steel industry remains of advanced costs in millions.
Financial charges threatened by the industry from the promotion of the ÖÂrum are from the table.
It remained in the release of the renewable energy environment in the stocks for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Journal" (WAZ, issue of Friday).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of close negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore planned to ask the steel producers to use gas from the heading for electricity production for their own consumption.
The steel industry, based on the German Branch Association, threatened the additional costs of EUR 120 to EUR 240 million per year.
Gabriel said the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission to discuss with Commissioner of Competition Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC conversion of 20 Pro.
But they will not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
This will be extended to the Quo status of the current scheme.
The effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is significant.
"In view of our campaign 'Stale is the future', this is the first step."
"There must be followed."
"In addition to the reform of emissions rights, climate and employment goals are to be weakened," said IG Metal Chairman Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued when the worldwide largest producer country of China was putting a massive steel on the world face of the weakest home request.
European producers propose Chinese steel concentrations prices.
During this early year, the situation has been relaxed.
In order to show a declined import rates on import steel, otherwise, the economic perspectives in China have been obtained.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German Branchen Prince Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
The prices would have been stagnated again.
The branch reacts to the difficult situation with further cost decreases.
Thyssenkrupp would not like to exclude the closing of individual works.
In the German steel industry, approximately 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturer remains careful despite increased prices and continuous orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes well six pro less raw steel than in the previous month, as the economic unit communicated the steel on Friday.
After a short rise in May, the amount produced now went back in the second month.
From the beginning of the year, the production is under the previous year.
The band calculates in the coming months, thanks to a improved contract with an increased expenditure.
Community, Spirit, Health: Sing to older ones good
The song has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: When a young girl was in school course, she was in the teacher study, and today the 78-year-old songs in an elderly course.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, joyful and all more alive, she says.
In the nearby, she does something good with her health and her mind.
Singing is just from several perspectives a great hobby for elders, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorliga.
Most older men sing in Chor and share the joy of music with similar feelings, described Hackler.
By regular conjunction, elders can connect and manage social contacts.
Because often social and social structures are resolved in the age, a Chor is then an ideal opportunity to take time with others.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in his chor: "I want to reject and organise, to leave and learn from each other -- a Chor is a very special form of cohesion."
Sing can be a positive sense of effort, he says.
Because the elders train a deep and controlled breath.
He who regularly requests his longs does not speak as quickly out of the puzzle every day.
Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice in the age, singing is a optimal hobby.
For elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal work community of elderly organizations.
In the elderly generation, the common song had a lot of place value, which belonged to every day, both in the school and in the free time, she explained.
Lenz often observes that the song or hearing of songs in elderly people has many memories, often related to positive feelings of their youth.
Through songs and special melodies, demenzers are self-demensively distracted by long-term events.
In the case of Singen, the head will also require a special performance, says Lenz.
At the same time, you can be able to adjust to your own voice and to a given rhythmus and adapt to the other songs - that is a great cognitive challenge.
Right older people who live alone practice not only to be able to be on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you are learning through the song in Chor, says Hackler.
A pleasant public is a great praise.
Moreover, the self-value feeling whisked by singing in Chor.
Show yourself: If I exercise for a long time, I will be better and wake outside me - this experience strengthens.
Thus, there are good reasons to start with the song.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not slow - even if he thinks to have a little talent, advise Lenz.
You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who hears it when a sound comes?
In searching for the boat, elders have different opportunities, says Hackler.
If someone from the known circle in an older choor, you can simply join yourself.
In addition, cities offer overviews of the audience in the environment.
Whoever wants to sing in a church Chor can turn directly to the congregation or to the church leaders.
Ancients are also found on the Internet.
Whoever doesn't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet search.
Whoever wants to sing should be able to join a Chor, advise Hackler.
Songs do good to the soul and have something free -- that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than catcher on cries of the young animals
Biologists have examined in Hannover what effect it has to call catch babys on awakened animals.
They were surprised that the Miau also left the men cold - but they always walked in the subject to women.
Women's cats can recognize the degree of cat babies in the midst of the little ones.
They react about → Pro faster to the sound of cakes that are in great tribulation, such as producers from the animal high school and the Medical High School Hannover (MHH) found.
Catherine also reacts to the calls of cakes, however, always the same.
"Only, the acustic differences between the millions of smaller and strongly excited boys for men are not comprehensible or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first one of the publications published on Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" physician.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and sounds of the chain chains were distinguished with the difficulty of their need for help.
In total, nine grown caters and eight cates from MHH were observed.
They were played for a call of little ones who were taken from the Wurfbox for three minutes and were driven by mother and sisters.
In other cases, they were confronted with crying of stronger exhausted boxes, which were normally highlighted.
The researchers maintain their results despite the low samples for exhaust.
"All women, even those who have not yet had their own growth, responded differently to the cry," Conerding said.
They moved faster to the sound speaker when this call of the very higher boxes played.
This ability may be aborted or developed with the sex advice.
"A surprise was that men had reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, people have already studied the reactions of women and men on children's sounds.
Moreover, some of them showed that women felt sensitive to children, even if they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina shewann reported.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan sugar is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, the only football star Hakan sugar has been adopted.
He will be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the puzzle trial, Turkey will find a important football game again.
Before the duell of the Erzrivals between Besattas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul about the supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly indicated: "Business as ̈al" is indicated.
In the derogation of the exemption state after the recycling trial in July, the Government did not affect the normal citizens every day.
But this does not apply to those who are suspicious to be the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, responsible for the trial.
It doesn't stand before the football.
In contrast with the former Starkicker Hakan Sucurs, the State lawyer made a arrest order.
The middle time of sugar in America will therefore be a member of a terrorist group.
Sugar shall be the attachers of the Preacher Fethullah Gülen, responsible by the President of State Tayip Erdogan for the trial of the puzzle.
As the exception for 90 days applies until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" on public places throughout the country explained that Erdogan was completed in the middle of the week.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into the attachments and enemies of Erdogan.
The Fans of the Worker Club Besichtas are traditionally not the friends of the president.
But what the Greatness of Turkeys, in view of dramatic experiences in history, is the strike decline of military puzzles.
Even the fans are agreed - whether their heart is broken for Galatasaray or besiege.
At Pokalsieger "Gala" it will return especially to Lukas Podolski.
His sports value was evident in the past season: with 17 ports and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first game time as topscore of his association.
At the end of the game against Fenerbahce, he reached the 1:0 match.
The magazine "Fanatic" admired him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in a great way and assured his mastership of Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the recordmaster found a reasonable conclusion.
After the prerounding K.o in the Champions League, the "Lives" also separate early in Europe League.
In the Super Lig, it's only about six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"It's what we've done and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besichtas, the game year was better.
In particular, thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasoners as Super-Lig-Tors King, put the base on the 14th title.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope back to the 31-year-old.
In this context, the Florence, which was under the Treaty, and which had been granted to the Bears only after the puzzle trial, did not return to the political situation in the country after the EM's vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," the physician "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman cited.
However, it must be ready to delay around a third of its annual year-based EUR 7.5 million, Orman explained: "We can't deal with its content in Florence."
Despite the Do: These athletes still have medal Chancens at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for Doës (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other translated Lightathletic singers can only laugh about it - they struggle in Rio for medalans.
The theme Do determines as before the rows of the Olympics games in Rio.
The Russian cousin Julia Jefimowa, who had accused her start right shortly before the games, was gnadenless and exhausted at her start (100 meters of breast).
It offered a scarry scene: With a set bed she was still stolen into the hall and had provoked with her invasion.
When it stated that it wouldn't get gold, the public was out in a jubel storm.
But there are still many other sporters who, despite the past of Do, go to the beginning of the Olympics games in Rio.
Here's a review:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m staff/USA): The 34-year-old belongs to the most conflicted figures in the light athletic.
He was already locked twice for Doʹs (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since Bann is running the Olympics of 2004 and the former worldmaster even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one in the world and is used as the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100,4x100-m-staffle/Jamaica): The two-year olympiatic and seven-fold world master had to leave a six-month lock in 2010 after she had demonstrated the adoption of Oxycodon pain.
After a operation, she had strong dental pain, she defended her 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): 2011 was tested by the Olympics of 2012, the world master of 2013 and the European Master from 2010 to 2016 positively on the prohibited methylhexanamine centre.
Perkovic addressed the scientific receipt and has been locked six months.
The four most important worms in this year go to the account of the large gold favorite.
LaShown Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): Peking olympics and two-year world masters were tested in 2010 and locked 21 months.
A fund for the size of the pen was responsibility, charged Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old is more than 200 and 400 m the fastest man of the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hamerwurf, Belarus): Almost one athlete was so many medals afternoon recognized.
Thus Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after his testosteron Do has been detected.
Moreover, the 40-year-old Olympia silver in 2004 had to be delivered for the Steroid Dos and the EM Title 2006 for testosteron misuse.
The renewable bronze media of the Olympical Games 2008 has also received a judgment of the International Sport Court of CAS.
With 80.04 m, he is on the round two of the world range.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The well-tree ordeer and gold favoritin were tested only in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old World Master, indications were found to take a prohibited neighborhood supplement, the lock of the World Anti Do Agency WADA was slowly expired and left on 13 July.
Bombs terrors in Thailand - Austria damage - More Death
The Austrian message in Thailand stands in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schn日, Friday morning.
She has suffered distress and has been treated in the hospital, but she has already been able to leave this again.
Her home travel planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the other explosions on the rental island of Phuket and in the Southern towns Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, as well as Sn.
In about 200 km south of the capital town of Bangkok, Hua Hin was exploded in two bombs on Thursday.
The police said that a Thailand had been killed and had been hurt about 20 people, including Austrian, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
On Friday, then, two steps went up again, so that another person was killed by the authorities.
Furthermore, Phuket was reported a bomb explosion in early morning.
At the detonation near the popular bathroom border of Patong, a taxi carrier was hurt after police data.
In Surat Thani at the south-east coast of the country, there then exploded another bomb that killed a city employee.
The rate of speed is made by the authorities in a flower beach before the coast police river.
In Phang Nga and Trang at the southwest coast and in Chumphon at the south-east coast, the Detonation requested a number of injuries.
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombnattentate 日 the same manuscript," said Armageddoner Danai Kritmethavee Friday before journalists.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
It's too early to express too possible motives - however, it's probably about the acts of muslim rebellion.
Thailand media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombs of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
However, the Thai Police explained that the attentats were not related to the islamic rebellion movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local Sabotes that are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Moreover, the bombs were placed by enemies of the government military junta.
In the past days, the authorities would have received secret indications on future attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact date and places.
It is still unexpected what group to stand behind the attacks.
The police urged its officers throughout the country to strengthen security around the major government buildings, airports, trains, tourist attractions, restaurants and enjoyment quarters.
In Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they are not opposed to tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.
According to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security staff.
High safety risk (Security level 3) benefits for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhcla and Preah Vihear and environment.
After interactions between security forces and muslim population parts, it will be advised before non-necessary travels in these provinces.
Increased security risk (Security level 2), the country's benefits.
The amendments on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a conflicted referendum on one Constitution issued by the military Junta.
This will also take great influence on the military officer in the next years.
Junta-Chef and President Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were a trial to strike chaos while the country moved towards stability, improvement of the economic camps and tourism.
The military unit, which had taken the power after a phase of bleeding injustices in 2014, seems to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military officer has not been able to get the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, at an attack on a popular Hindu-screen, 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Idential Movement" is advised in the visibility of the Constitutional Protection Office.
According to several country members, the Constitutional members in the Federation have also observed the group.
"We see in the 'Idential Movement' points for efforts against the freedom democracy foundation," said Constitutional Protection Boss Hans-Georg Maasen of the German Presse Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of islamic faith or from the Near East are extremisticly diffamed.
That is why we are watching the movement now.
The "Idential Movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multicult wave", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "loss of self-effectiveness by overcoming".
Constitutions in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Axes, Sachsen and Thüringen - see already the "Identifiers".
Maasen said that his authority voted closely with the national residents in the decision.
"Groups like the "Idential Movement" try to get their target group where it is," said the Constitutional Protector.
Generally Extremists try to talk to them with younger language, often with popier music.
It eats islamists as well as legal extremists.
This is not a positive advertising for your own thing.
The Propaganda will respond to the people emotionally.
Young people are specially attacked there.
That's an annual.
Toletus had reported from several federal countries about the contacts of the "identifiers" to AfD policies.
He said that he had no knowledge of it.
For the protection of the Constitution, such contacts are only relevant from a certain point.
It is indicated whether the party, in this case, changes their objective direction and becomes extremistic by certain extremists.
It is therefore exhaustive whether such individuals have the impact of the party.
This is not recognizable.
With a view to the clear increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum applicants and refugees, Maßes said that he would not yet speak about a new right terrorism.
But in the past years, we have found that there can be just terrorism structures.
There was the "Old School Society" group or the Freeteller Group.
It may be clear that further legal terrorist groups or smallst groups are designed to plan attacks against asyl seekers, refugee houses or attacks from other right-extremistic motives.
However, it is not recognizable that a legal terrorism is controlled in Germany or in Europe.
The current groups have occurred at the regional level or in social networks.
Sorry, there was a statement that many incidences had come to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
There were no criminals, politically motivated criminals or attachers to the right scene before the attacks on asylum undertakings.
"So many people have committed criminal acts that have never had anything on the hut with legal extremists before, who may have been politically indifferent or who have chosen CDU, SPD or left, which have then radicalized themselves by right-extremeistic voting machine."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros has the Internet hit
Not always the olympics or world records determine the lines of the olympics games.
This shows the courageous invasion of Robel Kiros had at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the easily overweighty swimming swimming from Ethiopia so slowly that he was not longer to see in the TV images.
He just disappeared - whatever the depth was chosen.
In the social networks, thereafter was a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended with a rest of 48 seconds and placed the 59th place of 59 starters.
However, it was not just his sports figure that moved the attention of the international media.
Why, though, the 24-year-old shares in the Olympical Games?
The Ethiopian has received a special starting right from the international wheat band.
This will be distributed to make swimming in subrepresented countries.
Since most sporters run in Ethiopia, they just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros has completed for the big run.
The first names were made the .
Some media covered him as a "Robel of the whale".
The English Boulevard sheet "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made it fun.
His time, he only spent with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of free style, did not play any role there.
Similarly, comparisons with "E日 the Eel" were also made.
In the Olympical Games 2000 in Sydney, the running of Eric Moussambani for median attention.
It was unforgettable that the swimmer's arrival from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to join in a period of more than 100 meters of free style alone.
Freneticly, Moussambani was at that time inflammated.
The 22-year-old learned to weep only eight months ago, and had never resolved a long distance before the fight.

Trump doesn't see the threatening choices
The Republican presidency candidate Donald Trump refers to a election campaign in Florida.
If it doesn't become a choice to the US president, Donald Trump has already an alternative.
Then he's going into the vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential election in November, he would have been relatively distressed: "I'm going to take it either, or I've got a very, very beautiful, long holiday," the candidate of the Republicans said in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV sender CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end for political correction, if it's okay, Trump said.
Thus he approved the President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as a founder of the terrorism of the Islamic State (IS).
Inside his party, there was more opposition.
Post comes into the trade with electrical transporters
A electron additive vehicle of the German post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently large.
The post plants to cover its electrical vehicle StreetScooter too.
In Küre, the Concern wants to start the trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer their electronic transporters from the next year also on the free car.
"We want to enter the sale to thirds," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has examined whether it should be delivered by letters and packages to other businesses since months.
Post-President Jürgen Gerdes said that there was always a question, such as handworkers.
According to the news magazine "The Spiegel", the Bonner Concern will enter into the mass production of vehicles in kire.
In the post-aged manufacture, the company plans to build up up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the concerns wanted to clearly increase its float of electric cars and pile a long-term complete conversion to the environmental friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very strong step toward 2020," he said end of July.
I can imagine we're transforming the full float.
The StreetScooter has been active in Germany since 2014.
GfK leads to disturbing business numbers
The GfK Consumer Research Undertaking exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The retractions came suddenly - but not very surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research undertaking GfK noted that the chair of Mathias Hartmann is more uncertain as long as the success of his promised.
Turbulences at the top of the Nürnberger Market Research Undertaking GfK: After re-deceiving business payments and the retreatment of the business management, the world number Five of the market is before a new job beginning.
The GfK Chairman wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already separated from the Supervisory Board by effect by 12 September.
The carrier has already taken the member Gerhard Hausruckinger before 1 September, and the company shared it.
He will officially take the function of a "president" until a follower for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the retractions, the company called "unseen opinions" to a long-term business policy.
Details would not be called a company speaker on Friday.
The future leader of the market research undertaking is still unexpected.
In the investment circles, on Friday, the restructuring of the remaining success of the restructuring beginning years ago was increasing in the event of the actors.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK hospital since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after five years," he said.
In view of the latest bad GfK business payments, each shareholder will sometimes be unfortunate.
"If that was in BMW the case, that would also do the Kadts," he said.
The company could not stop its loss carriage in the previous quarters, even in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361,2 million euros, the turnover was 6,1% under the level of the comparable previous quarter.
On the first half year, the turnover increased by EUR 721,2 million by EUR 3.4 Pro.
The winning in the second quarter, in particular, was charged by the low value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
Consumer Experience in business areas of 139 million euros protected a loss of 148,2 million euros to the concern under the stream.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK developed another 19.7 million concerns.
Incidences - bus washing in crowns in graves: Eight Damage
In an accident of a travel bus with 43 elders as passengers, eight people were hurt on Thursday in Krumm hearn (Land Cruel Aurich).
Two of the insects suffered severe damage, the police shared.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a traveling company from Eisenach had to remove its information from an opposite laster that was partly on the roadway.
The bus went from the street right and dropped into a grave, as a police speaker reported to Aurich/Wittmund.
"Furthermore, because of the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus on their own," she said.
The firewall frees the insides.
Six safe cars and a notebook car came to the accident site on the country road 2.
The unbroken travelers were brought back from a line bus to the town's town part Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the traveling company.
The investigators invited the laster driver and possible Witnesses to report to the police.
The taxes per cubic meter waste are covered from 1 October 2016 for the area of wastewater Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkhal 3,44 places to 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop 3,36 euros (by 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (by 2.18 euros).
In the installation in Azendorf, the waste taxes will be increased later, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After a higher calculation, the water waste price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mr Bernd Steinhauser (CSU) reported, the budget approved by the Court of Agricultural Council Kulbach was determined that the coverage of these wastewater facilities occurred.
The Casendorf market is binding on legal basis to operate the facilities costly.
Since 1 October 2016, citizens and business and industry operators of welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will need to take deeper into the money buyers.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 Pro.
As Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt showed the body, a new calculation of taxes for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period of October 2016 to September 2020, over-related coverages from the previous calculation period are also to be compared.
The grave tax increases based Schmidt to act in all three wastewater facilities relatively small with a very small waste attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
This would have a serious impact on the low distribution basis, for example, on applications for the necessary repairs of several thousands of euros.
Furthermore, the waste collection in all three installations is easily delayed.
In addition, all three installations are not allowed in the declining period of calculation due to their age of sanction and reparation applications in a significant range.
The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that Azendorf was required to exchange the mechanical liquidation facility on the basis of a damage.
In the pumpwork Welschenkahl, nearly 20 years of age were required to be recovered, and after nearly 20 years the first clearing plant had to be exploited, the light lamp was exhausted and built an additional flexibility in order to comply with the water legislation.
Schmidt: "To these exceptional applications, the continuous maintenance and preservation costs were to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity, which remained clearly under the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhouse showed that in the small waste attack in the three installations, the applications for the operation and the entrepreneur are "completely" in the light of the water waste.
In this case, additional Schmidt, the market community has remained in the past 20 years of great entertainment costs in the waste facilities.
The situation for those facilities will continue to continue to be stumbled by stone houses, unless the supply area of the wastewater combination is able to extend to these installations because it is the internal institutions.
Bulgaria is booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the maximum value (from June 2012) and the first over zero since October of the last year, as positive 0.2 %.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (Juli 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation compared to July 2016 to -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase in the following groups of consumers was observed in the comparison to the premonth: food and non-alcohol trees (1.7%); transport (1.8%); free time and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); different goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fell on clothes and shoes (2.2%); mobile, budgetary devices and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained like in the month of alcoholic drinks and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuel; communication; as well as education unchanged.
Snapchat "anima" effect criticized as Asian karicature
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired of Anime, but some observers say that it is insensitive to race.
With filter tool it allows approximately 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with a way that is already limited to absurdity.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy Lightenstein.
The filters are inflammated, distortioning tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All deficiencies reached the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past criticized themselves in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users suggested a filter that had a slider, false teeth and opened wheels, some critics called a racist karicature of Asians - "Gilbert View".
They wondered whether these repeated conflicts showed a greater problem that the company had diversity.
The news and competition were broadcasts in the middle of the week, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat reported that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered a excuse: the filter was a hommage of Anime characters and not a caricature of Asians.
But outside, the racists have learned, the filter was reminded of hurtful closures.
Others refused to determine the comparison of animals.
In a e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American Art Student, whose twoth was broadcast over the photos that the filter was "injurious and injured."
They add that "is hard to argument with the contravention of a very contradictional Asian career and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow view was taken into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that translates this cultural stomach.
The culture seems to be involved in an endless war of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats of the great public of young people - which in things are races different than their elderly opposers - could better go out of expecting sensitivity.
If one of Snapchats filters makes a picture that is prominent for a user, "that is much more difficult that such things remain unremarkable than before," said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday Zhu dismissed, who as a product manager and engineer for the media to remove its Snapchat account, invited others to do the same.
In a support for the media and in a telephone interview she said that she believed that racial conflicts reflected the lack of diversity in the attitude labels in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the white, only men's leadership and ended their approach with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Out they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their own place so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they are safe or well to say anything against."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat mostly unresponsible.
The company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as a private undertaking.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but, according to one speaker, the company has recently set up a personal responsibility for subrepresented population groups and for internal integration efforts.
Zhu said on its side that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
The military management of the ISIS is a mistake of secret service information, the Committee of the Congress
The United States Central Command military citizens changed postal information to make a more optimistic picture of war against the islamic state in Iraq and to enable the real states in place, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the fighting force committee, secret service committee and the Weather Budget Committee, reported of great insatisfaction under Central Command secret services analyses that reported how their estimates changed to the efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, controlling the military operations in the Near East and Central Asia.
"Information of news services, which were typically denied by high-range Centcom commanders, had regularly a more positive picture of the efforts of the Ananias against terrorism than the actual situations would have been allowed in place and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," a journal article cited the report.
"What happened in Centcom is inacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representative, stated.
The flight errors in Centcom are added to the top of the organization.
The Side Report shows detailed continuous problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the efforts to train Iraqi conflict forces.
Although there is no direct indication of the fact that governments have given orders under Obama to change the reports, it shows how the analystes seemed to have the pressure of their proposals to make a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, including ISIS or ISIL.
"In the first half year 2015, many Central Command Presse Communications, opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts matched," stated the report.
For example, a Centcom official said that a military rearrangement of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, the Republican Congress Deputy of Kansas, in a opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Centre Commands changed the postal reports to play the ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were played that the analystes were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed knowledge while the investigations are continued.
In addition, Centcom's further investigations are reported by the General Inspector of the Defence Minister.
The Democratic members of the Newsletter Committee published their own knowledge on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created a excessively limited process for the creation of post-service assessments to ISIL and the Iraq security services," said the high-term democracy in the committee, member of the representative Adam B.ship, in a opinion.
This process, Mr. ship, "slowed the publication of post-service reports", hurt the moral among analysts and "gave too little space for different opinions."
But Mr. Board and the Democrats have not found any indication on the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion".
The provisional results of the congress investigations were published on Wednesday by The Daily Beast.
In August past, New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were recorded after complaints of Centcom Analysts.
Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in a opinion that the Defence Minister would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in the past.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the news services and the Defence Minister welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reactions on the issue of a low air campaign in Iraq and other than (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Defence Minister).
However, the accusations of the past year have opened the question of how President Obama can leave the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State refers to trials of more than ≥ years ago when a Centcom Anal日, Gregory Hooker, wrote about how the former Government under George W. Bush faced the recommendations of many analysts only foretold a small occupation struggle in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current report on the Islamic State.
In the past year, Mr. Hooker's team, as stated by Governing Bodies, stated that against the statements of the Government against the raffinies held by the Islamic State, there were no significant effects on the financing of the terrorist group, since these provisional raffinies had been operated in order to cover oil on the black.
However, this knowledge was not published, reported by the Times in September.
Centcom's at that time commander, Mr Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislation because of his excessive positive assessment of wars at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to the rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The United States won fourth match in the fieldhockey of women, a showdown with Britain stands before
One day after she had shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the fieldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five tours in two games should represent a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said that they could not remember what they had ever done.
"I don't know." she said.
I don't belong to those who keep their gates in memory.
However, they know that the Americans lie at 4-0 in the olympical wet battle and are at the same time in their group with the British in the first place that remains insulted after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet together on Saturday on the last game of the first.
Both men have already been qualified for the fourth final, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams each will reach the first and second place.
The first place will take the strong Holland Islands a little longer from the way that leads the other group.
Whatever the game may come out on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising herbal through their success history four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey shot in hands (their two older sisters played sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years, she became the US national player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She lost the olympiade in 2008, since she couldn't make herself qualified for the framework.
Then the year 2012, where it and her team were all shifted.
In the following year, Parnham, an English, Tra’s National Team, began to turn the things to be better.
"A culture change, a mental exchange and a physical exchange," Bam said.
We didn't have the work pension in London that we had now.
We've been able to get the ruder completely around.
On Thursday, Bam opened the gateways in the first half of the game with a backward from the neighborhood.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tour, but the team showed himself surprisingly deep and holded the game stand from 1-0 to the quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flat, then moved to the middle and sprinkled the ball into the gate to make the Americans a 2-0 leader.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tourner for the port of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will it depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Inside the rage of the Olympics Games, the Zen of the Trampolis
Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and inevitable, a rare staff run between competition and efforts.
It is as if the olympical fake itself would be a burning staff that is reached by the brainbrush to the swimming to the tourner to the triathlete.
You can't activate the TV, read a magazine or listen to your neighbor's speech in the coffeeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley still.
Dooley, who is the first time in the Olympics games and a woman warm with grapes, could have been of course among these names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-faith TV performance if he was a swimming, tourner or even a fat.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in olympical trampolin tours for gold.
The olympical flame does not light every event equal.
Moreover, partly in the shadow are sports species that are not generally recognised: air pistolen shots, bowen shots, badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the bruising and let's rule it for a long time.
But if I can humblely make arguments for my loved one, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampolis.
Although the trampolin origin is a olympical event since 2000, when it had his debt in Sydney, it was so carefully realized in the past 16 years that many of the people I asked did not know that it was a olympia portart at all.
This may also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent Athletes to the fight, it has never won a medaille in the trampolin springs and has had a athlete that has done it until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians aim to share the prices for men and Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.
The trampolin spring has a certain external charm, partly because it is suitable for the unclear ear for a clown school than for the Olympics games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not a expert but only a linked enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonable circle of his never wanting appreciation - but also the thanks for the tour and touchance, the two species of sport that are essentially united.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "Sp".
Strengthing winners run on a gigantic trampolin, shoot up to 30 feet in the air, and need a series of falling movements (treat, heating and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated by an olympia program after execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will attack one another in Rio.
The most common olympical vector is just out.
Median hopes have to continue to go to gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes go and back, up and down on the game.
They are not only pursuing the target line or the output route, but also in television transmission a more hohnical goal: the world or the olympic cover.
The targeted efforts are noble, amazing, even fanatic - and it is enough to touch even a viewer to dress.
But that's also what I feel when looking at these games as something comforting.
This is why the trampolis offers an atmosphere.
The vector of the trampolin springer is upstairs.
A pre-motion is not the goal.
He or she goes off, seems to be hard like a astronaut, goes up, then go down, then unfortunately back up.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the remote, only the dreaming, elegant decline of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as competition in the Olympics games can only be.
The women's qualifications and endrunners will be located on Friday afternoon, at the streaming at 13.00 East Time; the men on Saturday, too at 13.00.
NBC will exhaust the endends as part of a afternoon block in two days from 14.00.
Inside the Olympia Meny, they promise a safe, good moment, one that will probably be overseen in the general tumult.
If the conscious increasing can only be achieved by the indication and objectiveization of men's athletes - as the men's tourners suggested recently in the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his calling for air, new prisoner.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long, a United States associator
Violent acting protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants who call for political changes in Ethiopia faced a violent opposite of the government.
Witness states that thirty protestants were killed during the compatibility with the police in shooting changes.
Is Ethiopia just to be joined?
In the last years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid partner of the West with a quick growing economy.
But in the past months, protests against the Government have destroyed the country and have developed in more areas.
Last week, thousands of people struck on the streets and requested fundamental political changes.
The response of the Government was, according to human rights organizations, ungrateful.
The Witnesses suggested that police were shooting and killing zig unarmed demonstrants.
Some videos about the protests that are confused from the beginning or beginning of this year show how safe young people struck with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The leader of the UN member of human rights now requires an incoming investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populating country of Africa in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, in general, receive so much western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded in a significant time.
His infrastructure has been drasticly improved - there is a new pendler train in the Main town Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually safe, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was all other than an example of democracy - human rights organizations continued to stress the government - the opposition in the country was limited and dissidents were effectively weak.
They were sent to exile or to prison, killed or cast into the wests of the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you press people and they have no other options except to protest," said Seyoum Teshome, a dog in central Ethiopians.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are a number of complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the destruction of the power of the Governing Coalition.
After a long-termly criticized choice last year, the Governing Party and its associates received the last seat of opposition and now controlled the European Parliament.
At the same time, the spendings ascend near the border to Eritrea; a fight against this crazy, covered line requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics provide that separatists such as the Oromo-free front or the national liberation front of Ogad, who have been forced more or less in the past years, could use and weapons again.
Many people explain why the feelings of disappointment after years are exploded under the surface.
The first seems to be harmless: artphones.
In the past few years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, since bilingual phones were always more frequently and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it dos in regular distances, especially in protests, many people still can communicate about Internet proxys that hide where they stop.
Many young Ethiopians suggested that they gathered themselves to protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Yeons, the Amharas, which comes from Ethiopia, have prospered in the world and economic, while they have exploited the Oromos, from which many muslims are and live in Flachland areas.
But that's just changing.
"We are in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade, and dominant.
The reason for the injury is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ancient rebellious leader, was too dead at a non-publicated disease in 2012 for 17 years.
He was viewed as a tactic genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly deceived in the reality of early signs of unconsciousness and to use special officers to process enemies and to make them insufficient.
"The current regime is missing this fundamental chick," said Mr. Abdi, a conflicttanalytic.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to become the position of Mr. Meles.
In contrast to Mr Meles, coming from the North Ethiopia region, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysers say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.
Preserve that the result will be more bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a urgency was in 2005, after thousands protested against wallows, which, according to the information of analytics, appeared to have been disturbed by the government and then stolen.
In the following races, many protestants were killed, even though they were less than in the past months and this time of disappointment was relatively quick.
Developing experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, and for their measureable progress in the fight against poverty.
But this has obviously not prevented the intensification of the internal crime of the Ethiopian government.
And she accepts an annual ethnic form.
Last month protestants attacked businesses conducted by Tigray in Gondar, a Amharian city, and the hatred against the Tigray becomes more usual in the social media.
Analytics say that the protests bring the United States and other western associates into a proper position.
The Government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently told that she had closed this base.
As the wests are clearly wanted to submit the democracy, he does not want his associates to join in a already volatile area.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very deep grateful turn."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to spread the last controversy around his campaign on Friday, indicating that his multiple repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously the "gronds" of the islamic terror group.
This clarification raised new questions on the ability to communicate with the Presidential candidates of the Republicans, whether it is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the public.
It also brings his companions who strive to take him in protection during an eventual phase, in the private position, to declare statements that he could not even have done.
After he had made the exhibition in a voting campaign at Middle Wednesday, Mr. Trump returned to the statement on Thursday and was in interviews that he really did not intend to explain that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.
But in a early morning twitter on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The second was the opposite to the previous day when Mr Trump said in a series of interviews he said that the accusation was completely serious.
When Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help the statement deteriorate by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wanted to deteriorate, the Republican presidency candidate would not know anything about it.
The last storm of the criticism is down to Mr Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign because of the falling inquiry values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic camp in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to taxes and that he had long-termly found their speech.
Mr Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his defence.
On the end of July, he took strong criticism, when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained, "Of course, I thought that is sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the language limits in the EEC and then to return to the need.
"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans are recorded, when they arrive, and then, where appropriate, "claim" anyway after the reaction occurs." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of exhausting the sound for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has accepted a more eating sound, since its inquiry values have continued to be returned.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist published on Friday showed a big preservation in the North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-and-head-head round in Florida.
Mr Trump is generally trying not to excuse for his provoking statements, he often accuses his critics to disturb his statements or to misunderstand his humor.
But while he focused on the attention in the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trumps Dirze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how to be provoking his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, ancient citizen of New York and one of the prominent speakers of Trumps, was a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, therefore, was asked for the rightness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have found the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was a nearly unknown, small organization, he called her inheritants, perfectly wrong, and it happened because he dropped the troops out of Iraq.
Most people try to argue that the Government under Obama, in Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread up by putting the situation aggressively under control in the Near East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them to round on each of his words and to be committed against him.
He allowed the "poor, harmful" television experts to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democrates discussed Mr Trump's excuse as only another evidence that he was unnecessary to the President's office.
Once the price is distorted from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a coffee coffee in Williamsburg, where only a bar could be paid that had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years served good coffee.
Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were distorted.
The Soap Cherie business, replaced by the verb in summer 2014, was replaced by the seif in the form of Cupcakes.
Inhibitors assured that it was the last loss in a gentriesian city.
The artist Molly's bapple wrote on Twitter, "I know that New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, except Chelsea Hotel, and Verb is now a shipping business."
But if New York is a change, then it's a new finding.
A repeated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one miles north of the original position.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar shark atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee, owner and business leader of the new coffee.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outside, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has learned many things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the battles buy the same expressomachine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new subscriptions.
On the food map are sandwiches with speck and cakes and there are garnitures such as capers and salted birds.
There are natural travel shots.
The coffee doesn't serve beer anymore, there are fresh bags.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a permanent power at the old tribe points.
"Several old customers were also disturbed by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived early in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had been to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink a while, she said.
"I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I had," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even if she orders a Blinded Chai Tea, which is another new addition on this day instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-year and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and always ordered the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss shot hour and they prepare my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new additions into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with speck, eggs and cakes.
Rodriguez said he didn't refer to the fact that the business had taken the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special shepherd for verb with the cold coffee of the coffee as suta.
"I think we'll go on her boat," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Poland inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card to the Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to make it quickly, so that his new neighbors would be welcome.
The location has further advantages.
A local saftlocal wants to fill and cook the cold coffee in the flash.
There is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building.
For many customers there is a new verb to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribe point and said he was broken on the ground when the coffee was thrown.
When the new coffee opened, Whitt said that the coming of the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a home.
"I had to ride it," he said.
The depressive eating of the economic crisis in "a rich food"
In March 1933, shortly after the president was raised, Franklin Delano Roosevelt entered his breakfast at Oval Office.
As a feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a weakness for raffinated delicatesses of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de fio gras and Maryland waterscreen supper.
His menu on this day was a little more modesty: eggs in Tomatesauce, cartofels and as dessert a flood pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Your husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The wedding couple is in Brooklyn Heights and are both food stories.
Coes the last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while he spoke in his book "97 Orchard" about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A pleasant dinner", which will appear on Saturday in Harper Story, illustrates the story of the kitchen's story during the great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Iceneberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, darkless imbiss in the Flatiron District, already in business since the 1929 Börsencrash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordained a fresh-case swimming with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, trutain with cartofels and vegetable mixture.
When reporter Hackbraten ordered, this couple found a discussion about the food in the time of the great depression.
"Rightful foods were very well," Zegelman said.
There were earth bread, liver chains and bovine bread.
They were prepared from a suit and something worthwhile that stretchs the suit.
Imagine to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as dinners.
Coe kidnapped.
"It must have been put into the magic as a flame," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in a household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.
Manages of women bought for men of field workers, and it was served freshly baptized pastete for breakfast, breakfast and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War I. "A Square Meal" is the way that the country was about to be no longer the Slaraffen country.
"It was a time to eat for the Americans a central, stressed topic," Coe approved why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was also stressed: Mystery foods such as bread and casseroles were founded to feed the casseroles as "wonderful species, re-valuation of food residues", noted the cheeseman, since cooks could hide inapethical additives under a creaming suicide.
The fresh fruit was replaced by a balanced dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the kitchen, was a rarely served luxury.
Personal mixtures have been tested because a caloriesic and nutrient satisfaction had a priority for smaking or even healthy kitchen understanding.
As a result of their search for the book, which includes also recepts, the cattleman prepared a court from this time, a bathroomed duplicate with the earthbutter.
"It wasn't a popular additive at midnight," Coe said.
"It was surreal."
Earth butters and bathrooms do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the domestic recepts.
As never before or since, budgetary operators, including Louise Stanley, leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943, have been able to accept the food habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in magazines and magazines, they encouraged women to become "containing policies" and to be justified by the challenge of converting pamp as cremish spaghettis with carotes into adequate food.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical leckerbiss.
In particular, the reports on the response of the Government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich kitchen eating.
Since he publicly praised the simple Iowa Bauerhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he eat as the million heavy man of the world to whom he has become.
"He loved continental kitchen like fish with gurkensauce," said Coe.
He was eating in a almost loaned food room and wearing a smoking.
He was a glorious reality foreigner.
President Roosevelt might have done the same error if his wife Eleanor had not invited him to set an example with magen.
As described in the book, a householder's wedding with no interest in smaking directions by Mrs. Roosevelt made the White House the most long-term food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortable prepared."
Property of the species from the era of the great depression, to eat, was deployed, soon as the country returned to the feet.
The power is on our continued focus on calories and Nah, said the cegelman, as well as how the use of food was applied to Nah.
The couple, when writing the book, had better understanding the food habits of Ziegelman's mother - for example, how she couldn't remove food.
"You had a real ability before the dilution of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman said, "You made people really sick."
There was the wind-building event.
After the Tellers were released at Iceneberg's, they and Coe have shown a dessert that they had prepared at home: the eating of plants that the president Roosevelt eat in the midnight.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Zegelman and f'ave added that it was a usual trick to disregard modesty recipes a sending name.
There were no slaughtered sahanne, only plants, something of meal, sugar, water and zinc.
Each of us had something resistently inside a lobster in the dark, brain glibber.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe got a trip three times.
Like a can-do builder, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
He was the Held of Aleppo
He set his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the Held of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to humans.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to image-time, saved life by almost 600,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives on the game to remove people from baptized houses and provide the first help in the war area.
You're the heroes of the war.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian, showing him in a 11-hour salvation of a childhood from the dreams of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syric a lighting symbol in the gris of the war.
But as he never saw himself, he said, "For me this is the true Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself attacked the victim, he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks.
The helicopters have removed four fass bombs over the Alzadia Bezirk, one was with Chlorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from spirit.
"We now remove the toxic rest of the bomb so that they don't play children with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The death bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest cheese animal is almost 400 years old
A rare view.
Greenlandhai are mostly in the winter to the top area.
This Hai returned to the sea after an investigation on the board of the Sanna research ship.
He was born 1624 and weeped with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland has only got 150 years of growth.
The Greenland Hai is swimming at the foundation of the North Atlantic, and in a hour it comes just 20 meters along the average.
Only when it comes to it, the five meters long animal sets 2,6 km/h and is half as quick as a robb.
But this lifestyle of long - suffering seems to be a pattern for a high age.
Julius Nilsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the Scientific magazine "Science" at any time from a Greenlandhai who could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifetime, which means a well-treeword for animals.
As a result, evolution biologists have long thought that Greenland haes were stoned.
The evidence was only missing.
Greenland's coasts are difficult to be observed, especially in the isismer before the thin coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures about the six degrees of Celsius, they are mostly in the winter.
Scientists know little about the lifestyle of the Greenlandhai.
They measured their time-limit when they paid six animals before Spitzbergs with a sender.
However, these hairs make this: In the magic of a animal, researchers found the rest of a robbe, and another had succeeded with the kitchen bones of a young ironberry.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrolied on the basis of the issuer and searched for Kadaver, which turn down from water shirts.
Julius Nilsen and his colleagues now have examined 28 Greenlandhai, which took the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzberg as a contribution from the depth of North Atlantic.
The smallest hail was just 81 centimeter long while the maximum 502 centimeter measured.
In order to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the linching of the haie with the 14-metode.
This centre of the eyelines is already coming before the birth of the hail, which contains proteins will not be renewed later.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of carbon-14 in the lensenker.
Therefore, your birth should be after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons tests, increased amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the longest beast with 220 centimeters, however, the Linsenkers had a low overthrow of carbon 14 from the atom weapons attempts, thus, in its study in 2012, it could have made its 50th birthday.
However, all larger greenland hairs had normal carbon 14 quantities in their linch brain, which resulted by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 hour for a 493 centimeter long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record-hai of 502 centimeters may have been even 392 years old.
That Greenlandhai women only get a growth when they are longer than four meters, it was.
Now the longer researchers could assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was at the swimming and was determined at 156 years of age, Greenlandhai with the increase of at least one half centuries of the time.
Moreover, it may be well-leaving for animals.
It is not a case that such mutandis live in needed armies.
In addition, the recordholder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, whose speck on the naked placed a 120-year harpunense pitch, was captured before Alaska.
The low temperatures often also run the organism of the living animals on sparflames.
So they're moving later - and older.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often especially big.
Because the volume is much faster than its surface, through which the animal is heated.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than at a gram of elefant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal, so, should be able to happen to have as soon as possible many offspring," says the evolution biologist Schuerlein.
However, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Double Pack Battery Background
With the subjects around the building, the Community has severely taken place at the latest session.
The committee facilitated the communication of Master Robert Putz that "finishing the latest building of residence areas can be started".
After declaring the issues of baselines, parsellation and exhaust issues and the requests for measurement, the sale of the basic pieces in the areas "Streetlweg" and "Scanau-West" (Region Binderstrate - Expansion Section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The community is convinced that the building areas in the landscape and rational residents are similarly responsible for young families and awesome elders.
As it was said, building volunteers can immediately be reported in the Rahaus, the consignment of the parcells will probably be consulted at its September session.
In order to be able to carry out requests for additional farmers related to the creation of workplaces, the Community decided to change the area use plan in parts first in the early year of this year.
Thus, in the sub-time area, the area already assigned there is extended by two parts of the State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefited by Brexit
The city of Am is therefore in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the best chances of drawing jobs and companies from London.
"It is very probably that Frankfurt benefits most of Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigt countries, leader of the Competence Field Markets and Immobility Markets of IW.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is unknown whether money houses can continue from London from financial business throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU pass, they are still sufficient for authorisation in Britain.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt_ Finance" calculates 10000 new jobs within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the Site of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for the monetary policy and supervision of the major banks of the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA insurance supervision and the risk Council of the ESRB.
Although the organisation of economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its main seat in Paris, this is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.
"The nearby to the note bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the attention," says IW Professor Voigland.
Although Luxembourg entered a large fund industry, the Dublin's infrastructure was more harder than Dublin.
Frankfurt is clearly easier to achieve the great flight.
Also points of the city with easily available warehouse mobiles.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigt countries.
In his home, the premiums for first-class furniture mobiles are also 50 Pro日 as am.
○ Frankfurt offers a strict quality of life as competition thanks to good medical supply and infrastructure and less criminality.
In a ranking of Mercer's business advice, the city stands on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Even if life quality is a question of the preferences, "with its already strong position as a financial position for the  skuld, Frankfurt could draw to other banks and investors," follows the IW.
However, London will remain despite Brexit-Votum of the most important financial area in Europe, my economic researchers.
For this reason, the power conditions are also stated: in London, according to the numbers of the Bank of Helaba, approximately 144,000 people in the banking industry, in Frankfurt were 62500.
Gilead receives rights from hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
A US officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has an appellation to the refund of the laws which have come from the hepatitis C law with the Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released by a damage payment of $200 million for the damage of two patents of Merck, which were related to the blockbuster medications Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US rider discovered a pattern of misleading behaviour from Mercks, the Myeide and other unethical actions.
At the summary of the complaint on Thursday, U.S. Director Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has appeal to accepting the costs that have occurred during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to equalize with Gilead, controlling the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90% of patients with liver disease.
The case returns to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained each other and took property on work, based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
The United States supported troops say that they have restored full control of Manby from the Islamic State
The United States supported troops returned the full control of the North town Manby near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left them in the city, a speaker of the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Powers (DKS) passed by the outcome of the remaining group of fighters who were buried within the city, currently, the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians held by the battles as ships, Sharfan Darwish shared the Manby Military Council of Ree's associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we're just running cleaning work," he said Reë's.
Clintons deserve 10.75 million in 2015 and deserve 34.2% taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax claim on Friday for 2015, which gave a revenue of 10.75 million USD and a effective federal taxation of 34.2% for the presidency of the Democrats and their husband.
In 2015, Clinton's USDs spent 1 million for adequate purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former president Bill Clinton developed almost 5.3 million USDs in Redehonorers; the former foreign minister offered an income of 3 million USDs from the Compag Simon & Schuster for its book about their office in the External Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for Vice-Presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published together with his wife Anne Holton, his tax statements in the last years.
They paid an effective federal taxation of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a opinion.
In a rare opposite, Donald Trump is hidden behind false statements and backwards in relation to his promises to publish its tax declarations.
It is usually to publish their tax statements for US presidency candidates, although they are not committed by law.
Trump, a New Yorker businessman, and his advocates have given as a reason for his refusal a tax check by the tax officers.
"You're on the train," Clinton's election campaign Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential agenda of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisory, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to be too public before tax tests are completed.
Trumps Critiker, including the Republican Presidency Kandidate of 2012, has already made it clear that his refusal of funding issues, its S for well-active organizations, business facilities and other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already been disappointed on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, where the high-ranging Republican Trump calls for his tax claims to publish.
On Thursday, she also talked to the subject during a talk of the economies in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last years and to publish its tax statements." she said to the multitude.
Politico reported that Trump has not paid any or only very few taxes during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax advocates and tax advisers on Friday, which indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election battle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billion and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons who deserve more than 1 million USD deserve a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
In the last week of the election fight for Hillary Clinton, Nebraska requested buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrie Conglomerate here has his seat to tromp to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.
Buffett said that he was also undertaken by an IRS tax check and Trump had "angst" before the electors and not before the tax holders.
Clinton's taxing campaign has published back to 2007.
The Clintons who now live in Chappaqua, New York paid in the average an effective federal taxation of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effectively combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The tax clothes of the Clintons of 2015 showed that they only covered USD 100 of their income as a salary, other than the majority of all Americans.
Its main money facility was a cost-index fund from which the Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 were charged.

Condoms with Chilipuder, firework bodies promote Tanzanias Elephant Protection
Natural in Tanzania uses an unorthodox way to stop the elephants from going into resident seats by people - they throw condoms on them that are held with Chilipuders.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for years ago, has intensified its support together with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in North Tanzanias to use a violent quarter method to protect their hauses and herne without injury to animals.
Earlier, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Life Day, which is dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Several since we have developed this ... Toolkit, we could see a change in their view within these communities, while they are much more convinced that they can stop the elephants from their fields without damaging the elephant," said the business leader of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a message.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a flash and the blassing in a corner.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" will be made.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body in a condom with the end of which is turned to the tissue.
When it is burned, place the condom up with a noll and sprinkle fine dust on Chilipuder into the air.
A hook is usually in order to swallow the elefants.
One of the last opportunities is a publicist who shoots a golden rain-feeding in the air and causes a sound, light explosion.
City Council decides on a single basis: No kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinfer
Normally, the St. Goarer investment facilities of business operators with Kusshand - but the individual trade in the nuclear city is clearly exhaustive.
However, the town Council now refused to rebuild a sale skion at the rheinber in direct near the building of the rheinbaron.
"We're primarily welcomed by the new operators, but at this place in an exposed position on the river, this kiosk does not match," Michael Hubrath said for the CDU group.
Jewish Registry switchs Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-choice has been removed after "Arabic" request - RT News
A French leader with Jewish roots determined a medium uploader after he had delivered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-election, since the Arabian guests had "requested" according to an employer.
Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah", exposed his difficulties in Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing a open letter to the German magazine FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the country preview list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that Israel was eliminated and removed in 2016 in Berlin, the capital city of the new Germany?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol provides a possibility to choose Israel through a private call center.
Looking for a clothing, the leader turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employer said that the measure was a "absolute decision on the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The reason that stood behind it was more wrath in the river.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the preference be deleted," was quoted by Lanzmann's employee.
The israelian messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reported the South German magazine.
We were disappointed and disappointed by this event.
That's really very harmful.
The fact that this has occurred in Germany in exact this hotel chain is even greater shame.
It doesn't need any clothes.
We expect the hotel "the right conclusions," said the officer.
The incident solved a pretty large resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandale.
Some submit to Kempinski Hotel that it would have been "released" to the famous invitations of Arab guests.
"Shammed Euch," it stated in another contribution, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurrystenm, is near a synagoge.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations of himself and called the case a "forbidden" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reported The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel would not be in the list of choices," quoted the South German magazine a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It is the fact that the country's preference has now been added.
Police introduces gas & gummichoses against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered themselves to demonstrate government reforms for the public education system.
The police placed the gas and the rubbers against the demonstrants.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to throw the students out, which led to the use of the police of gummish and tree gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw the graphics in the walls against the provisional president Michael Temer.
The latest protests occurred a few days after the mass demonstrants went on the streets to submit to the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, which was rejected by a vote of the Senate to their destruction from the office.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the cancellation of the sanctions, the Russian advocate in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, increased the trade range between Moscow and Teheran in the comparison of 70.9 Pro.
Since international sanctions have been rejected against Iran, the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in business in the country, the advocate shared.
The Russian companies are engaged in existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to provide market access.
Of course, the further trade development is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade summary between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9% in comparison with the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In addition, the Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 Pro’ and lodged $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 Pro to 158 million dollars.
The trade accommodation has been achieved by supply of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the newsman.
Dzhagaryan is a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visa, in the first line of the travel visa, to Iranian citizens.
Moreover, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, regarding the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the records of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year, " said he.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something from which the messenger hopes that it will change.
"I personally can recommend the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilisation in a good state," he said.
Searching for Witnesses: Tree’s overcome in forestbrellas
On Thursday, on the tree of Rewe XXL on the forest-brella Gerber Street has been performed.
Under the preservation of a shooting weapons, three darkly clothed persons who had seduced their faces requested the employee of the tree to issue money and then fled to foot and then disappointed with a silver-colored VW-Golf.
How much money has been buyed, the police doesn't share with.
The layers must be between 1,60 and 1,70 meters large, so relatively small.
The tree is directly accessible and unrequired from the park of the Rewe market.

Hagerloch: Pilgrims to the port of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. were on the road on a four-day tour of Villingen to Freeburg.
Four steps were administered together.
In order to overcome the time until the next roof of all ministers in expectative two years, the Superminister Round of St.A. has decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrim migration.
Different wallet targets were examined and finally disappeared for the Bischofstown Freeburg, where, in this year, the Holy Year of Mercy was offered with the port of mercy at Freeburger Münster.
16 The ministers of the poolbron, the grool, the hairloch, and the holy rooms were on the way.
On the evening before, Pfarrer Storost sent the pilgrims out at a small festival in St.
From Horb was running on a train at the beginning point of villingen, where also a Münster of Our Love Woman is, and thus the pilgrim road has been attacked by the Münster.
The individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse tomorrow and evening with various prayers, songs and texts.
But on the road, the ministies of field cross, capelles or churches continued to sing a song together from their own composed pillar songs.
For the overnights, each pfarrheims of the local pairs were available.
At the steps, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller offered a pleasant and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
Moreover, on the second day, it passed over furtwagen to goods.

The deserved recompense was a common grill at the bathroom evening.
After the morning puzzle on the fourth pilgrim day in St. Peter’s impressionary closter church, it went to the closet to Freeburg.
Apparently easily and happy, the minis entered the next afternoon at Freeburger Münster and passed the ports of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening of the munition, the ministers arrived at the target by Cooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After the ministry, the soldiers were able to visit the Sacrifice and the High Altar.
The next day was time for the breeding meter pole.

Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were prepared.
Shoot Callum Skinner swimming home when Brite Gold for Radsports
Scotland Callum Skinner was last night in the man team sprint in the velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old of Glasgow took the anker role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The young man made the legend proud when he struck home to gain a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England recommended a shocking victory four years ago, while today the fifth of six olympia goals.
They repeated the trick after they had only a humiliated sixth place on March at the roadways in London, despite the retraction of today.
The problem between Peking and London was the substitution of the leader Jamie Staff.
They did this timely as an hinde occurred.
Today's rest produced a lock that Kian Emadi and Matt empton tried to close.
Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the shot that has now occurred.
Hindes, Kenny - the guests with Hoy four years ago - and skinners put a olympiary cover in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the new countries in the first part.
And the British Trio won the duell with gold.
Hindes was almost back after his hour, but Kenny kept the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of ability made a large part of the transformation in which the hind went in a walk to delay it and allowed Kenny and especially the skinner to keep the temperature.
Today, he looked out of his position as BBC experts and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they ascended to the potest.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glassgow said, "It's a funny comparison."
I'm just here to do my debt and make me a name.
In the end, we have set up a olympiar record and won the world masters.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph on the Kennys and Hoys page, Hindes told that after a weak start, he was expected to fall on the train.
He took this statement back later and there was no invitation from England's Rivals.
In such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels with all the GB flags on the tribe like London."
We met as team in the last three months.
We left so bad in many world titles that it was incredible to win again in the Olympiade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, seven of 10 titles were won both in Peking and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect five days in the velodrome.
With the form Kennys, it is possible that he wins today of three olympical gold metals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years older than today, who also was born on 23 March (a appearingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exhaust of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what's going on today.
Kenny takes the next part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels awful to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other golden metals, he should be struck to the horse."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed ́ncy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have been the fastest performance in the four-four-km rounds.
They arrived at 3:51,942.
The welcoming word won in London Gold in 2012 was at 3:51,659.
The first and final (22.42) is located today on the second day of the competitor, where the wiggin will be in security.
He had struck with officers yesterday before the qualification when he was calling for functionary to measure his body size.
In the relevant female competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie at 4:13.260.
The GB team is trusted in his strong train radar team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics games and get a crowd of medalans.
After a real exceptional presentation of absolute domination in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were deteriorated.
The dramas were played in the background, so the return of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbing projects, as well as the rest of sizes such as today and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first night of the competition in the field, it seems to be like to repeat the legendary call of the GB, which has reached its high point at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's mixture on the basis of the cancellation of the Energy Treaty
The future of the Aluminium's mixture of Portland in Victoria - and hundreds of workers - is on the game because the investment operator cancels the Energy Provider Agreement and thus revokes all delivery contracts, as told by the provider of energy.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the investment.
A subsidie for 20 years shall be carried out in November.
Up to 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa facility in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - may be able to be closed.
Moreover, there could be dominic effects, since around 10% of the entire electricity production of Victorias is consumed.
2014 Alcoa put the Point Henry Schmelzerie, which led to a closement of the lesea power work last year.
Alcoa's snippet in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the annual speculation regarding the future of the investment, originally as a result of the strong economy and more recently due to the energy price of the investment.
AGL, which provides the large Alumi's mixture with Property Loy Yang A powerwork in Latrobe Valley, shared that it results that three other owners will announce their contracts.
The installation is located in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller.
"AGL seems that the investment in Portland will continue to be carried out, which means a further physical request for electricity through the smiley," the company shared.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were "backup operations" that would have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month cancellation period, so they will end 2017.
"The AGL therefore concludes that the contracts will be involved in the revenue in the 17th business year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL income from GJ 18 are currently limited by the prognoses of the strong term markets for large trade prices.
AGL reported that the value of the contracts has already been recorded in an annual end of $187 million in "A expectation of an announcement".
Alcoa said that the decision to buy the contracts, the "capacity of Alcoas... to operate the coverage or to ensure the supply of electricity to the smiley" did not affect.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year-old contract with Loy Yang that would have entered into force from November this year, even if it was still schuldige why it was revoked from the Treaty.
Analytics warn because of the bad economic conditions of the branch before closing the Portland Schmelzerie in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.
With regard to the statements of the analytical beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts on electricity.
If both installations disappear from the market, this would mean a significant decrease of the application on [strom ·].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a electrical producer," he said.
More than only a Kardashian Reality-TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the Vogue issue of September
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Manager and Mother of Kardashian Jenner Cris is on the cover of the desired September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the Marken Bootsman of Estee Lauder and walked on the Fashion Weeks in Mayland, Paris and New York on Thursday, announced the news on its Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I loved, the view of this covers to weep," Kendall wrote.
The enth · the covers followed a bizarre (or simply Kee > Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and products of Keeה Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ends it with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.
This represents nearly every birthday episode of a child sentence (Seacrest said: "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honestity of a cartridge in a sandwich at 8 hours in the morning), but Kris had to let their other girls share somehow in this publicity.
With regard to the edition of September of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes what the Vogue-Cover said ( she and her husband Kanye West were seeing it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a ligue for themselves.
The issue of September is the most sold amount of the year for Vogue.
With a range that is more like an imageband than a magazine, the depth draws a large number of advertising operators (Sound Fashionists were from the 832 pages of the waller 615 pages of advertising).
The enthing of his coverstars is so carefully expected that in the last two years, photos of the magazine have been checked before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In the past years, it was clearly more "beauty, models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar Price and Dior Marke Bootsman Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even in the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbruch Model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These famousnesses are not associated with famous persons or reality Stars or youths today who know how to rotate a Snapchat-video (a.k.a. if everything happens on Jenner).
They're really talented women who're exhausted in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, which occurred on the last cover, had the publication of Lemonade one of the most recent years of their kare.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV stories, Jenner's position was always stressed in the environment.
In June, the only Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the mistake of the moment".
These feelings bought up again when the message with Jenner's appearance came out on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to pass on the crime.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
They and all of their sisters make pictures of themselves on their respective pawall apps.
She's rebuilt pictures of Cindy's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she's seeing in reality TV. It's probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community laws show 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's assistance needs are denied by the Community law annually while the industry is making the effect of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five people - most of older persons, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who have no means for unrighteous delegations and similar things - are already rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
The legal services of the community, which are already overloaded, are prepared for further shortages.
Since June the next year, these laws will be lost more than 30 per per cent of their joint funds.
The Director of the Community Rights of Queesland James Farrell said that the latest exhibition of the National Association of Communities Acts showed that thousands of people were already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without revoking the decision of the Federal Government.
"Queensland Community laws are chronicly underfinanced, which means that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected," he said.
People who leave violently active relations, people with invisible and impressive debts, families that go through divorces, workers who have been unrighteously solved - all these people have legal problems and this highlight shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30% since June 2017, which means that thousands of healthier people from Queensland will be forced to address their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Advocate-General of the Federal Justice and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to submit these reductions immediately so that people can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the Government fulfilled its assignment to highlight legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to see the needs of the Community law and their customers and that the Government of Palašťuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after the employee's spectacular weapons moved
New York: Donald Trumps campaign has been accused of normal inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February has sent a shooting gun to a worker while they were on a Jeep in February.
The case is described in a complaint written in the middle of the court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, an ancient software programmer for the campaign in this State.
Bordini urged to have waited for months that the matter would be regulated inside before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "attracted a gun, put his right point finger on the decline, and hit the run in Vincent's kneekel," Bordini stated in his accusation.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign, Bordini concluded that at least four other persons had made the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the complaint.
"The weapons must not be fought to make damage," added Bordini.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidency candidate has solved a reproacher when he said that the "Second Amendment People" should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton was chosen and called judges.
Trumps campaign cleared that the media would have spoken his words from the context and that he would not be forced to violence.
Boardini's complaint requires damage from the campaign for the damage of careful obligation and Philip for the damage of the body and remaining soully damage.
Trumps Press speaker Hope Hicks was not to be made for a opinion.
Try to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local poster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer the campaign's employee.
On calls to advisory companies, innovative Consulting Services, it was not reacted.
The Republican presidency candidate Donald Trump has already led a controverse campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Research before country whales: Lose SPD and CDU
In the future walls in the United States, Mecklenburg-Vorpommers (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) are significant losses for the SPD and CDU Governing Parties.
This gave representative investigations from the INSA Research Institute for the "image" quotation (freeday).
Since the red-swarm government coalition in the north could not continue, this is not possible according to the Berlin investigation values.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have the opportunities to continue to set the Government leader.
In Mecklenburg forpommers, the SPD of 35.6 Pro severely five years ago decreased to 24 Pro.
This is why the party is able to look forward to the CDU that could return to 23 Pro.
The space is crossed between left and off.
The left rounds on 19 Pro _BAR_ (earlier 18,4 Pro _BAR_), the AfD would represent 19 Pro_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The green, despite easier losses of 6 Pro _BAR_ (before 8.7 Pro______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
NPD and FDP would not represent each 3 Pro in the country.
In the Berlin members' choice, the SPD was only on 23 Pro _BAR_ (option 2011: 28,3 Pro__BAR_).
The CDU has only reached 18% after 23.4%.
They are still behind the green with 19 Pro _BAR_ (2011: 17,6 _BAR_), but at the left with 15 Pro _BAR_ (previous 11,7 Pro_).
The AfD would first represent in the members' house with 14 Pro.
With 5 Pro, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would, in contrast to 2011, lose the entry.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: First Artphone
Email and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost a half kilo and was more than four times as hard as a iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand.
In contrast, it was pretty smart.
The memory built was at first eight megabytes, which would offer about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, to the business - and it was the first phone.
For a few euros, Liebhaber can purchase the devices on the Internet, but they are sometimes coming from the rock time of the Internet time.
However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced the product a few months ago on the computer center of Cebit in Hannover as "Office in West Task Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could have been able to send and receive a number of SMS and e-mails for those standards, even by fax, to get the communicator.
Even access to web pages was possible through HTML browsers, even though quitting slowly.
A computer was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.
There was a small antenne, and the phone could be expanded like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of an artphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
Nobody could know in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the artphone era.
Since then, everything's different.
The smart phones are a success story, even though not for Nokia.
The phone party of finds experienced an exampleless devastation, was embraced and deployed to Microsoft.
The market is dominated by suppliers today who have come many later than Nokia.
Always be online everywhere, this is for many people today every day.
2015 there were nearly two billion billion phone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were spent on Samsung and Apple only 555 million tracks.
The worldwide exchange with the devices is about 400 billion euros.
This is how the well-reaching businesses of the unnumbered app providers and telecommunications concerns come.
In the midst of the artphone, a whole industry has occurred.
The decisioning crossing to mass came first to begin 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac-World.
He promises three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and a Internet communication, easy to use everything through touch-screen.
The victory of Apple started, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the concert.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the view.
They disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The word now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The artphone is 20 years after his finding a self-comprehensive.
In the district today, every German looks 88 times a day at his phone.
"We all have to learn to remove the artphone once," Janina Kugel just said, in the Siemens representative, responsible for staff.
Permanent achievement is, in the meantime, used as a flight and a blessing.
England must lift the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and in all London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as at the same time in 2012 in London, when we made a big approach to ensure that all our N& and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade had great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will come back by creating new opportunities for local seats and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will only create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs, and prepare an end to unemployment in the airport.
As they were forward to us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge to extend Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world level.
The duplicates had wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question.
Like the Olympics games Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 10,000 new jobs, £211 billion to scientific growth and to leave capacity and employment both in order to allow aircraft and in total GB.
We have chosen a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years following the world's best airport terminal until T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequently running steps of the world.
Now they are ready to provide a running step, which is supported by £16 billion to private investments.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It's time to draw this olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a power of skills and employment that can be proud to England.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Boards and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Kath and Mouse Game" on display blocking
For enterprises who win money online, according to one of the software manufacturers try to handle display blocking, a "catch and mouse game" equal.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on his desktop page, published adblock Plus a blog post where it reported that users could update their filters in the program to block republication in the social network.
On Wednesday Facebook reported that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding his advertising indicators so that it would difficult to recognize display blocks the recognition of which part of the advertising page.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to handle the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin and Her fight between the open source Community and the surroundings is already since the discovery of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the worldwide largest company for social media has been in the fight is a strong indication of how anxious display blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, as a result of the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blocker; almost four times so much 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users every day accessing on Facebook over their mobile en-equipments, the phone phone 84 Pro of the Facebook advertising entries.
The company has seen it on the display blocker on the desktop PCs, since mobile display blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile application for the social network and instagram, a speaker shared.
Advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of income, thus Facebook seems to be rewarding.
On Wednesday, Facebook told that it would update his "Show Preferences Tool" to have people more control over publicity targeted on them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be anxious because they would also block contents on the page which are not advertising.
"For the users this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to speak the problem," shared a Facebook speaker in a email communication.
Display blockers are a stupid means, so we have been able to raise ourselves on developers tools such as Ad Preferences to put more controls in people's hands.
Women's transfer to Swiss cars in the accidental suicide
The victim was in the middle of the night on the car.
The police calls the Witnesses after a woman was transferred on a car in the early morning morning on Thursday in a disgusting suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near the morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
One woman put it on the street in the darkness "in an act of destruction" and was found by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Switzerland at 49 years of age, who was transferred by several vehicles, a loading, wanted to kill himself.
She died still from the place.
Several drivers have already been captured, but some have not yet been identified, said the police who invites them and every witness in the case to report themselves.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, divided Gilles' headshop to Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to wait if one of the drivers is shown.
Did a consensus be avoidable?
This is something that the State lawyer must decide," said the court.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the darkness on the carway - was decided that the cars should not go out from that a footstep runs in the middle of the night on the car road, as it was called in the magazine.
Last year, a policeman of carriable murder was released after she had passed over and killed a man who was on the A1 night near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the Court understands.
The Court concluded that the policeman who had responded to a call had a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect exceptional and unpredictable" situation, said the judge.
Everyone who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should be reported to the police under paragraph 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate model: Venus was only resident
The Venus was probably resident in the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Objectives at Goddard Institute for Spacee of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have shown similar conditions with its heavy, waterless surface and CO2-deep atmosphere.
Economy operators have previously stated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their close atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earthly atmosphere, and yet slowly turned on.
The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once it had enough water and geographical variability to enjoy life and had a rapid disturbance.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 Pro matters.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of the Venus exposes its Sunday side for almost two months," explained GISS-master Anthony Del Genio in a press communication.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud, which works like a rain screen to avoid the surface from a larger part of the sun heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model highlighted a history of Venus similar to evolution, which was previously considered by planet researchers.
Although it was sometimes invisible, the Venus was exhibited -- over billion years -- too heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were deceived and their water was burned from the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen was discovered, only a dick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly thickness effect -- the Venus, as we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as a tray of the Avalanch
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a Tra's and Vice President of Hockey operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to a too small co-determination right in the decision process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic visited this decision and noted that the Unit will immediately search for a new tragedy.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as a leader and Vice President of Hockey operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, suffering and determination," said the 50-year Roy in a opinion.
In the course of the summer, I have been long and very following how I could improve this team to give him more deepness, that it needs and bring it to a level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of Tra's and Vice President of Hockey operations must be perfectly voted to the organization.
He must also have a co-determination right to decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakic, who had attended Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and want him only the best for the future.
Roy was exposed at the Avalanches 2013-14 as winner of Jack Adam's Awards as the best tragedy of the Liga.
He led the United to 112 points and the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was killed in the first part of the playoffs of Minnesota and lost the seat in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches had a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard Spot at the Western Conference at five points.
As a Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadian and the Avalanch.
Northern sea oil workers re-searching, set out strike
Working fights for the recompense for North Sea Oil Workers will be excluded while all the fighting parties put themselves on the table for a new interview round, said negotiating leaders.
Strengths against the Oil Service Leader Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Du日 Shell.
"Wood Group and the Units and RMT facilities can assure that we have agreed to restart the current fighting process," it says in a common statement.
We will hold a few wholeday meetings in the next week, which will begin the beginning of the next year to resume the problems.
The facilities said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible loan reductions from up to 30 Pro.
Wood Group has decreased the advice to his contractors in the North Sea this year about 9 pro by negative market pressure.
The reduction in rates of the company follows a 10-percent decrease for the employees of Onshore in 2014.
The company said that afternoon reductions would give the company the necessary space to come through the market rental.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, since it has analysed its business activities as a result of its mega combination with the British Energy Business BG Group.
As a result of the lower prices of oil oil under pressure, energy undertaken by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
The Schottic Parliament member Dave Anderson met working leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest jobs that have been located in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
2016 less than 1.4 billion dollars are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to averagely about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler misss rotation rate of stars in the starhead of the plajaden
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomes to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the stars of the plajades.
The new data helps the astronomes to understand why the stars are rotated to different rates in the starhouse, and in what context the rotation periods are with the spread of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his sun system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press communication.
The starhead of the planees is 445 lights from the earth.
Stars in this starhouse, which have occurred about 125 million years ago, now have the age of awakening.
They're turning fastest now.
These ridicule stars had large quantities of starwinds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a breathing effect on the stars.
When a star is old, his rotation rate begins to delay.
Kepler misss the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognible star-fleck -- like sunlights --
The newest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with the dancers, with larger stars of slow pirouetes rotating smaller than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the places we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, but more faster rotors tend to be very light stars," replied Rebull.
Since the starhead of the planees is so close, it serves as a ideal cosmic lab to compare sterling qualities such as rotation rates.
"The starhead of the plajades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
It is still much before us about us, we want to learn more about how the way, wall and why the stars delay their rotation rates and thus delay their "tanz shoes".
Rebull and their colleagues reported in three newspapers their latest analysis of the rotate rates of the pledges, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A conflicted baseball star breaks off
The trees walked faster in Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional recovery announcement, the 41-year-old Profi on August 12, against the Tampa Bay Rays will last be the trikot of his New York Ya日es.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-year All-Star Game participant of League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen to be the most valuable player of the Liga, 2009 he won the world Series with the Yaıes.
His signature under a 10-year-old contract has been protected by 27 million dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he works futurely as advisers and youth coach - in full content.
As player, it paid Rodriguez for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and from 2005 the Yaıes he created some miles of stones.
With the Hall-of-Fame partners Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only show two other baseball players in the main statistics similar values.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be taken into the baseball's glorious salon.
Because Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so disturbed is his occurrence outside the place.
In 2009, the Superstar was allowed to take steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties because of a construction in the so-called Bi©lice scandale until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be a major suspicion for a year through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done me a pleasure for 2014 because I have spent 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez suffocant at that time.
He's not going to be soundless, too.
Since many baseball legends in their last games received the big feet again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include abscheeds tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win each game," eated Yaıes-Coach Joe Girardi.
Instead, Rodriguez, who was married to the shower Cameron Diaz and who followed the relationship with Popstar Madonna and Kate Hudson's viewer, Sympathy announcements of the fans by the Yae-retrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the attachers sang at the 4:9-decline against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases
Notice: due to a positive do-prove, weighty Adrian Zielinski cannot start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympics games 2016 are overcast by the first official events.
A scientist atletin would almost have won a medaille.
Before the seventh day of fight, the first of the cases of the Olympical Games in Rio de Janeiro have become.
The Chinese Swimming Chen Xinyi, 3000 meter-hinterniferin Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Poland weighter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - directly before the critical lightthletic conferences come to time.
In Chen, the diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated on Sunday, which will be used as a masking means for dog substances.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court of Justice CAS visited its exclusion from the Olympical Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place at the end of over 100 m Schmetterling, only for 0.09 seconds, she lost the bronze media.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminars more than 50 m free style.
Chen requested the opening of the B tests and a hearing at the International Olympical Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the issue "very serious and requires full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of CAS and accept the judgment."
The first time in the history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of sporters with positive cases.
Similarly, in the night of Rio, the message about the positive sample in Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the Ofensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this is "incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV sender BNT.
It's innocent, "the only clay could be the following supplementary means," explained the lightthletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the EPO.
Danekowa has been temporarily suspended, as BNT also must have been positive.
Bulgarian Minister Bojko Borissow immediately related to the criticism of the Athletin.
"I don't understand why the sporters don't take the right locks," he said, "We are Bulgarians under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, all weighters from the cross-to-date national cannot participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also tested by the London Olympics in the class up to 85 kg as his brother Tomasz three days ago positive on the anabolic Steroid Nandrolon.
Both face the receipt, however, cannot be started in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the beginning of the lightthlets, the case Danekowa is a further difficult step for the reputation of the whole sport.
The world band IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian community to a exception for systematic does, including the leuferation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
Moreover, in the swimming sport, the former crimes in China were also providing for violent disagreements between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese olympiatic Sun Yang harsh.
"The Son of Heaven's whisky."
"If I see the podium more than 200 m free style, I want to deliver me," Lacourt said in the French radio.
Sun was also in the middle of a composition with Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and respect for Do-Betrugers," said he.
Sun was tested in 2014 in the Chinese masterships at the stimulans trimetazidin, but only a three-month lock had to be left.
Data Class: So perfide pressed hacker her solving
The programming programmers of pressing software are currently targeted undertakings - and are involved.
According to a current survey of Malware-specialists Malware bytes under 540 companies in Northern America, British and Germany, 40 pro­perties of the companies concerned in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with Epresser software.
In Germany, nearly 20% of the companies were already targeted by ransomware pressure.
40 Per of the victims were willing to pay the soldiers requested by the workers to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The workers specialize their empressor software according to the observations of malware bytes, regardless of attacks in business networks.
If they are there, the potential to exciting redemption is clearly exhausted as users.
"We're currently watching a terrible rapid evolution of the damage software," said Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Klečinski in talking with the "Welt".
2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the deep-pressing software discovered for themselves.
First, the users were the goal, but the exchange to company attacks has occurred terriblely in the past months.
Ransomware → after a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it is targeted for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Then the software presents the requests of the pressors.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptoweague - Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is on the game with users, firms are related to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production stops.
Consequently, the damage falls when a ransomware is attached.
22 Pro* of the German undertakings reported to the ransomware losses of turnover, 13 Pro° had to completely interrupt the business activity, in one case people were in life.
In Germany, multiple hospital victims of attacks were already threatened by the loss of hospital acts.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only encourage the problem," Klečinski says.
However, 80 to 90% of the companies who have been acquiring their data again.
For Manager, it is difficult to refuse the request of the acters, in view of residence in the operation.
The hackers again know that and try everything to build a reputation.
In a current area, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user areas and the contact with the pressors and come to the result: The workers are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to become more money.
They declare their sacrifices by chat, how they can get through Bitcoin, correct free support websites one or decrypt other example files.
And after payments of few hundreds of euros, enterprises are to be solved in part to negotiate hardly and to pay five rates to obtain their data unencryptedly.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless winning from the ransomware pressure, the hackers will always be professional and share the work, the security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus supplier Sophos explains: "A individual person can write a ransomware within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then enhance their damage software in the form of a software builder to the pressors.
The earlier malware kits occurred by covering the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 100,000.
"In the supply area it is a adapting tool that can be changed smaller configuration, appearance and burning," says Wisniewski.
The empressors are then seeking further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are logged in one of the fores in the underground, buying the set of a criminal and ordering another to install the software on many computers as possible.
Payment is made per hosted.
"In general, the criminals then spammer with the spread," said Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is, however, in many companies that better ensure their data.
More than 50 Pro日 of the company-IT responsibles in the Malware bytes query trust that Ransomware can be able to deal with file-buck-ups and scannersoftware.
Thus, the workers are already pursuing new.
"If the encryption of data only is no longer sufficient threat to repair, the workers threatened the publication of sensible data such as customer lists or pre-calcules," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Klečinski.
This means that the damage potential is still more than before.
In addition, the workers could futurely take completely new goals on the Internet of things on cereals.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worthy of such a ransom sacrifice.
If the workers then, instead of heating in the future, block a whole fermentation road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to packaging everything: a little SUV, a little coupe, and also the ambiguity of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually a flexible everyday.
Although only 1,60 m high HR-V is more small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first and in the fund, it does not affect any place.
The materials of the internal are well forged and act pleasant, only the cockpit surface is falling down there.
The HR-V is more lateral than comparable vehicles at stauraum.
There is not only a 453 l coffee space available at high-up and 1026 l in expanded back refunds, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the back bank's seats can go up like kinosessel and offer stauraum from the ground to the cover of 1,24 m high.
The coffee room can be well loaded, but the lad height of 650 mm is something more than comparable to Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-diction with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V due to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in large rotation areas.
However, he may make his work a little slower.
Happy is the daily consumption of 4,7 l/100 km.
There is another motorisation: a 1,5-l-benziner with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-radiator is not offered.
The conduct of driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But the alignment may be something more direct.
The compensation does not open any desire in the tested top "Executive".
The security systems belong to the City Notream Assistant (to Tempo 32), the collection warning system and the tracking assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "the following objects".
Very reliable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the smart temporary ruler reacts to the identification of the signs and disturbs the speed when needed.
But there is only for the top expenditure: 7-touch, Navi, App-Integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are located under the handsheet and therefore they are to get something ambiguous.
About 29000 euros for the well equipped top depth are all right.
Whoever doesn't want to invest so much will receive the benziner from 20000 euros, the Diel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 output standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a multilateral and everyday car.
Airline not holding: spring on flight bridges
A airline does not hold for a passenger on the flight broadcast.
Since a detention is only able to be considered typically for air traffic, the Supreme Court Düsseldorf argumented (No.: 18 U.12.14).
The complainant had broken a knee.
However, the accident would have been able to assemble everywhere -- it is a general risk of life, such as the court.
The flight company didn't have to charge the man's damage.
Sickness case: When payable by the operator
Sick vacants only get money back after their journey when the cause of illness is to find free in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than Property of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely diseased on the second day of her Turkish authorisation.
She had almost all the vacation in the room.
Their illness led the accommodators back to a defect clearance plant that seemed to have disturbed the sea water.
The family believed that the journey was insufficient with this - and complained against the enemies.
The complaints were not successful before the court.
So the clearance was actually defect.
However, the complainant learned shortly before the complaints were denied.
He had to go out until the seawater was fine.
Thus, he did not harm his information obligations, in the case of the judgment.
At the same time, no pollution was found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - maybe by covering each other - belongs to the general risk of life.
From 691 guests were only 38 sick.
The Maizière said that after the violents exercised by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State must be exhausted and disappointed to respond to terroric roads.
Of course, our country will not answer the violence of the acters with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be able to get the terrorists.
If criminals have to quickly leave the country, this will enhance security and strengthen the acceptance of the people for refugee policy.
The Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Conference Day election.
He also announced another personal strengthening of security forces, even though "in the average four-second range of sizes over several years".
Sympathic advertising for terrorism must be again punished.
Video monitoring is to improve, the weapons rights will be renewed so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be difficult.
The most recently discussed weakness obligation for doctors should be kept in accordance with Maizière's words.
However, he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the doctorship, how to reduce the risk of citizens, he said with adequately mental events.
In order to resist the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that it is necessary to improve social sustainment.
Teachers need to be better prepared for trafficking with traumatised people.
In order to follow criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), the Maizière is designed to be used by decovered investigators.
SPD-Cheef Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increased security."
It is important that the Ministry of Interior has clearly spoken against actionism.
"It was an earlier for the hard workers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
The Maizière had previously rejected a call from the Union after a Burka prohibition and abolition of the double nationality.
A general prohibition of completion seems to be constitutionally difficult.
You can't prohibit everything you're refusing, and I'm refusing to carry Burka's.
You can talk about rules such as in road transport or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter forwarded the Minister to simulate new anti-Terror packages of reality and actionability.
Left-participant Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotted languages and a disturbance of the right of residence will no longer bring people in this country security."
Better driving flows on the car travel provider
It is regularly on the road of environment - here a picture from November.
But this should be changed: the strategy should be extended.
This is a message for all car drivers who are on the environmental road every evening when they carry over the car travel (A 43).
The landscape of road building will extend on the next Sunday and midweek (16/17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Leader Wesseler Street, a 700 meters.
Then car cars can fit directly from the Hammer Street to the right.
The great advantage: the decree is to be divided early, and the total decline is improved in the multi-profit section of the Federal Street 51.
The idea with the extended export had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The road turn on the manufacturer nerves the cars, especially between 17 and 19 hours.
The workdays are enough to get back to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond it.
The reason is that the needle is on the B 51 short before the turn of the Weaseler Street.
From here, the verification is simplified only through the car rental bridges.
The second track had to be rebuild for a few years ago.
The reason: Statistics have shown that the breasts have no longer the needed tragedy to be two-speaked to the carriage of gravity.
As long as this engine pass and the working day-to-day delay will be held, the competent country operator cannot say.
However, it is to be calculated for years: because the bridge has an official useful duration until 2034.
For the prolongation of the right-to-daughter, the landscape has awarely chosen the weakest time in the school vacation because it was to be counted as obstacles.
The verb will be carried out on Sunday and middle-week at the building site.
Intercultural travel: Culture offers for schools
The international school class visited the theater "The Invisible House".
The United Nima's and the young theater are now planning a music project.
The United Nima's allows youths with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Child House has visited a view of the price-ground part "The Invisible House" of the young theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" started by the United Nima 19 students visited the inscenation in the small house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the Unity, which has set the objective of the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classs the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project.
Most of the youths in the class were coming to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Münster.
Thanks to the Choreography, the Scene images and video animations, they were possible to follow the course of action, so the press communication of the young theater Münster.
The United Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theater will cooperate in the next game time in a music theater project.
From October to December, youths will have the opportunity to visit professionally dismissed courses in the areas of ang, dance, show and music without flight and migration background between 14 and 20 years.
Property offers for children and families in the field of theater game and theatrale language reporting are in the planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the decreased escape numbers, the combination is calculated with many classs that want to share.
Rain place stars shopping: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-snupped guckers in southwest Germany a strike on the night to Friday - but there is still a hope.
The night was bad for clouds and rains to watch the heavens speech, said the president of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night for Saturday.
Weather should be good, then we will certainly see many stars in heaven.
The star shops are persians that belong to the fastest star shops of 216,000 km/h.
They have their name because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus, which rises in the north-east.
Recreational night: Tips against sleeping
In the evening, you're going around forever, you're awake for hours, you're not thinking of sleep anymore tomorrow before the wheat.
That's all other than recovery.
You always have such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, some fourth of the wakeed sleeping and more than ○ Pro’ feel their sleep often or permanently as not recovering.
How are sleep problems or sleeping problems expressed?
There are several forms of sleeping, and there can be many reasons for them, Hans-Günter Weeß, representative of the German Society for Slaughter Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand landtimely below, but the insomnia is, so, an insult and a slaughter.
As soon as you sleep, many people feel uncomfortable or inadequate, says Jens carservant, representative member of the German home doctor association with practice in the low-sachsian property.
What is behind sleeping?
The causes of sleeping are complex.
Thereafter organic, mental or behaviour can be put on, but also medicines.
Not rare is the sleep stuff expressing another disease.
"Very early awake is especially often in depression," weeß says.
And it may be that different persons demand each other.
For example, those who have an accident of bands can be wrong, wait every two to three hours, and may begin to seize every day's problems and organs, gives a example.
This leads to stress, and sleep is no longer possible.
From whom should you sleep with Ar?
Who doesn't sleep well and is affected on the day for a month in at least three nights a week, should go to Ar.
The affectation can look very different: you are disrupted, mild, unsleeped, have difficulties with attention and convergence, is easily routine, have disorders or physical difficulties such as magic or headache.
It is important to find out their causes in order to linch the slaughter.
As treatment options, including behavior changes, cognitive behavior therapy or medicines - classic slaughter bottles only occur in exception and maximum for two weeks.
In Germany there is little sleep medication, Prof. Ingo Fietze, leader of the interdiscylinear sleep medical centre of the Charity of University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in the case of sleep problems, you should turn to the household, advised wheat.
It can explain whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should be in the lab, and what's going on there?
For the study in the lab, medicals advise, for example, with breast-feeding, sickness, sleeping, or if you do not find the cause of a slaughter.
It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.
The day should be normal.
"Don't be sleeping afternoon," says Fietze.
After the deal, you're going to bed at his normal time.
Besides the electrons of the body, a nose brilliant, a brush and a feeler at the finger.
Also, a camera on the cover opens the sleepers.
How can those concerned face the problems?
There are a lot of staff in which you can use for a better sleep.
Weeds include: Regular sleep and upstairs, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't televise to sleep, avoid alcohol and not look at the hour night - then you're starting to calculate immediately, and that's not even advantageful.
What the dungelcamp has with missing medals in the wheat
The former German Swimer Markus Deibler expressed himself on Facebook to deceive the DSV team at Olympic.
In December 2014, he took the first time gold at the short-term campaigns in Doha and set up his first good news at the same time.
Now the former DSV-Atlet Markus Deibler has been set by Facebook before his former team colleagues in criticism.
"In a country where a olympiatic is 200,000€ premium and a 150,000€ king should not be wondered about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook site.
The support system in the swimming sport is bad, but the controls are very good.
We can't competite with countries that promote very much and do not look as exactly or even operate in the subject of Do.
"I don't say the controls are to be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler should have been reported for nine months ago.
That's exactly what you should do with countries.
"Who is not able to be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/F's WM/OS before a certain time, must not participate," requests the elector Hamburger who is in the meantime a railway.
Airports: bands of packaging depths
Professional diebe at Airport Düsseldorf
Citizens of the Düsseldorfer police were arrested on Thursday by two women and two men in the age of 50 to 61.
The fairly suspicious had a number of pack and pack depths as bands.
By 21.30 p.m., civil officers in the field of the Airport Düsseldorf renewed a band that was the police from the past department of stealing.
The two women and two men have committed several delegates since mid-July this year and have been Community, working and especially professionally.
Specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four facts to the debtors who were committed to crimes to Germany.
They used over EUR 15,000 in total.
Alte buildings, a few linen trees, along with another head-stone plant: The Rigaer street in Berlin-Führerrichs. It doesn't affect the first corner, but the police counts it to the "Germanal Places" of the city.
If you go through the road from the East to the West, you get to games, a fresh-scale baby garden and a bioload.
At the fashion of a green house, somebody shot "wreckly!"
In contrast to a lidl that is to be cut shortly, it is already built: To 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.
However, articles about this "trending part of the city", as the competent real estate of Friedrichs, are preferred by burning cars in the last weeks.
A reason is that the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, in the middle of the conference contracts, but in the earth's rooms are still occupied and are enjoyed for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Internal Senator Henkel has been expressed several times for a heavy police action against the project, which has been covered as "No-Go-zone" for police and the 94 as a startpoint of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, the rooms in the earthquake, the border boxes, with 300 police officers, were patroliated three weeks, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three guardians at the place, locked parts of the street and stopped attending the house with number 94.
Construction workers renewed the rooms in the task of the unrecognised home owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administration court dismissed that the space was illegal, and one day later → Police and building workers under the jubilee of sympathisants and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents go to space with children, people sit on the citizens in front of the households in the sun, others interview the form late.
In direct near home projects, a basic school and children's gardens are located.
Left violence is not the main order of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neubuilder who lives in the kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is boring three children here, is primarily generated by the police presence.
With the residents of the household projects, they share the concern of growing midsts and gentri creation.
It doesn't sound like a choice who wanted more than a police protection from vandaling links.
The funeral that the Berlin Industry Senator and the police between the householders and their neighbors are not likely existing.
Friedrich in East Berlin was a traditional quarter of workers, which has a low average income and high poverty risk today in comparison to the city.
In addition to households and its born projects, there are already a long choice: 1990, many households were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire street near the Rigaers.
Since the more under a large police order was released in a regular road battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still resided today by those who had been occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the city share has become a magnetic for tourists and electors from all the world: with them, people are now divided from DDR times and former householders.
This is also notable for the rents that have been renewed by almost 60% since 2009.
Reconstructions in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised by inherited shifts or freshly stripped fascides, which have been handled with color bubbles.
No other road was so often mentioned this year with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason for not all neighbors to view this as a problem may be that they are not extremely affected by criminality: criminal acts such as body injury are almost counted against police.
The largest part of the crimes constitutes damage in cases that trendly take the rebuilding and freshly renewed houses.
For Kerstin Newbuilder who lives in a home for 17 years near the 94 surrounded, it can not be uncertain.
As regards violence, it is reasonable: The people in the 94 are their neighbors, which certainly have not been.
Also, the famous burning cars have no longer given it in the Rigaer.
For the studied architect, their road is not a criminal focal point, in contrast: "They are helping one another together on the street and getting more of each other than where the other."
Rebuilding is consciously in the Rigaer Street - and remains.
Therefore, it was so important for her that the people would return their road: from the police, the medium and the media that suddenly all called the detention over the city part in July.
However, in the eyes of residents like rebuilders, the road is continued to be removed by them: by unfair rebuilding in ancient battles that disturb the ancient residents.
"There are, lastly, ownership apartments that are not interested for many here - people who are not so well viewed here," she says.
"I can't absolutely be good."
But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including police and residents.
For tours that are harmful over color bombs, Kerstin Neubuilder has little understanding: The home projects and the left scenes belonged to the choice.
He who goes up should be conscious of it - just as someone who goes into a kneesquarters can be able to complain badly about the warm.
All those who have been presented with names have been asked not to be called by their right name
Urbach: Annika Bogchle is a new refugee commander
Annika Diochle is the interview partner in matters of integration and organization.
It is a social worker in the area.
Since July, Annika Bogchle is the refugee commander for Urbach.
The social pedagogin supports the Achim Grockenberger management team.
It seems to be an interview partner for all participants: refugees, workers of refugees, administrative, authorities, and other members.
Regine customer from the worker claims that the honorable publics are more than thankful that Diochle is now there, the egging Woll Milk Saw, which has a problem, especially.
In this way, some - less stressing than much more on the number of jobs in desired areas - have been targeted as the administration wanted to express the position.
Electricity has been a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the social work, as well as a egging wild milk.
However, administrative work is not its central area, I think Annika Diochle.
In particular, it is about organisation, work with people at the front of the place, as well as behind the kitchens and network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has expired a 50-pro-cell for three years.
"It was the best time," says Regine client that Annika Diochle supports the honor and main shareholders.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are in the wasenway
A serious problem has been found apartments for the refugees that have been recognised since some time.
The communities are responsible for the delivery of accession.
You must take refugees in your own or advised residence rooms.
The costs for building, renting or renewal of these accommodations must be the communes themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Agricultural Council to community and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been made very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, to be assigned to apartments such as Godchle.
Thus, final apartments must be constructed, as it is so beautiful.
So the new containers will soon be placed in the waterway.
But not only with apartments.
Perspective is the steak, Regine client and Annika Diochle agree.
Furthermore, there are practical places, training facilities, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that must be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine client.
Work in building or help homemasters, perform useful work - and it is motivated and very correct, as Annika Diochle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.
It's "no job treatment".
However, activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Bogchle and client.
People have to develop a feeling of association.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with home and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So, there are also administrative and honourable inputs.
It is central that the refugees have the feeling that they are desired and welcomed in Germany.
The long time of the procedures is a problem.
You have to declare to the refugees that it is just a long time and that it can overwrite the time, for example with language courses.
Whoever develops the feeling, he can help anyone in Urbach, doesn't have to work and be unnecessary, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "Luutes who do not have anything to do." Thus, the work of Diochle and customer is always to motivate others.
It's all a "mamuth" job already.
A difficult question: Do they have both after the latest events before radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine client clearly, "what some may be called naiv." A risk can be and does not want it to be excluded.
The helpers are sensible, but they are already.
These events are also the subject of refugees.
They would have been the best that the attackers would put them in full.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client.
They would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, main and honourable officers have to look at activities in the area and in the region.
They always have the background that a new stock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Needs Germany a top limit?
To answer this question clearly, it seems to be.
In fact, it's unfair to put helpers in the place.
"In Urbach we haven't yet arrived where we meet," Annika Bogchle said.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also points out that the urbators are already forced to integrate the people before.
It's now about 100 people, mainly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political world position is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
