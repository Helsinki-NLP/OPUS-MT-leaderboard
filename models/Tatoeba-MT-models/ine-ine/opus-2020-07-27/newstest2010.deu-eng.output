Barack Obama receives the peace nobel price as the fourth US President
The president Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to be here as the fourth US President in the history of peace nobel.
Moreover, he receives the diploma and the medaille and a scheck over 1,4 million for his exceptional efforts to intensify the world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The leader of the White House comes tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian Metropole and will be busy all the time.
To this end, he is presenting the Nobel Institute a rubber, where he is at first meeting with the five members of the Committee who have chosen him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the high point with the ceremonie reaches the prize of Obama.
He receives this as the fourth President of the United States, but only the one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House has already advised that Obama would talk about the Afghanistan war when the price was taken.
The President does not want to remove this topic because he knows that he is taking the price as a president who is currently leading to war in two countries.
He has enhanced war efforts by sending further troops to Afghanistan a few days ago, which is not to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremonie Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the scheck over ≥ million Sweden crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to make for good purposes, but he has not yet decided about a specific charitable work.
The Programme of Action proposes then a banket with the President and his wife, where the King and Queen of Norway will also be present to the Prime Minister and 250 other guests charged.
Obama was very retaining the price from the beginning.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he did not deserve the price completely.
He also repeatedly repeated that the price is not only for him, but for all who strive the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he concluded that it was "request for action" for him.
Nature is accused of pressure
The Leitmeritz Policy accused the President of the Citizen's Association of the Leitmeritz Leitmeritz for pressure.
In several cases, he introduced professionals against certain building procedures in the past year, for revoking his vocations, he asked the investors for his benefits, said the Leitmeritz Police Taler, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Community Lubo -- Studicka.
Now he is in prison and it threatens him to a prison penalty from up to three years.
The sort-M-container in Brünn doesn't ride well
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, and in the Southeast towns you find the sorting container on step and tritt.
And in Brünn?
There you need to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable M's tons.
I don't want to claim that the waste trend in Brune wouldn't work at all.
But I think whether the Council ladies are not too concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brown is located in the waste trends in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always able to produce only paper, glass and plastic materials, but especially through the number of tonnes for such waste.
Have they ever tried to exhaust the PET flashes in a collection box?
This is the same art, especially time and strong nerves.
The only place that I've found until now is the seasoning place towards the matches.
Mr Underka, his colleagues should not be harmful, but this is too little.
Except that waste trend is not a honey-shirt in other parts.
Thus, the whole series of my friends are not sorting the waste.
From failure.
It's too far to them to the tone of the M's.
I don't wonder.
I offered myself after the feast to get a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I haven't seen any color tons in view.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the roadway.
But the M's got almost over.
This is still the center of Brown, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some sort of isthetics are probably cold to the burning socialists.
They like to buy the city a Eishockeyliga that makes us shame in the whole Republic instead of buying a few more tons of M's and offering the sorting of other materials of raising for a cleaner burn.
I am glad that I could also visit my adoption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-COM company, Brown is really the worst in the southern area.
The "Paroubek" Budget has solved the money for pensions and hospitals
After the left party has given more money to farmers and officers despite the Government's view, there is no money for pensions, hospitals and building business in the budget.
But not for state debt or for international courts.
This causes more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists have made the increase in the maintenance for some groups, they have considered that the government's money for the emotional costs, the elderly interests or for the hospital money would be worth it. "This is only a relief of the problems in the future, putting mines," says Janota.
The loans are always paid by the loans, and the money is needed to be refunded at any time.
Too much to choose where to take the state cash is empty.
If the social performance or costs for the State holding are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all whose left party now gave more money: the firewall, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or the hospital money from which 1,8 billion are lost, people must not have the ability to get this money.
But for the price that the State is still debt - in the next year, there will be not only 163 billion but much more in the state case.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and the costs and interests will also increase.
The State will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be allowed to increase the added tax only lowly or to reduce the maternity money as the government made in its opposite package.
As a result of the balance of money to some electoral groups, five billion will be found in the next year for the development of cars and railways.
This is most importantly the sections of competition that can't be re-projected and possiblely agreed.
At least get what is not free.
This means movement or position of thirty large buildings, which also is the European Gild creation, warns the speaker of the Department of Defense, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it take a salomonian rate of money - it adopts the CEZ shareholders in which the State is owner of the Property, and then the money will be expelled into the Funds.
The problem is that the height of the division is never secure and it is no longer an infinite source.
In the previous year, CEZ broke 18 billion in the budget.
Annual payments are paid from the dividends to the environmental damage liquid, the pension accounts, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget by EU rules to the level of 5.7 ProIP.
But this does not end the carneval of the conversions yet.
Nearly three billion dollars, the budget was decreased for various compensations for the victims of communism and crimes or for the execution of courts, even for building.
It is not safe that the State will come out without this money.
It's a clean lucky game.
If we lose a international court struggle, we have to pay it too, Janota clearly.
The Minister must then simplify the money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserves.
Hundred million were also missing for the already started two-ground project "State Case", which would enable on-line monitoring, for which the individual staff deploy the money.
The first step starts in January.
If the Minister doesn't find the money anywhere else, the project should be arrested and in this case there are sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next artphone will control two operating systems
The Americans consider the future with a phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The proposed plans seem to be very promised.
It's enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in a few seconds in the Android exchange.
Exactly this option would like to present the VMware company, which was able to focus on the development of the computer software.
We allow you to execute two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, declared by Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November of the last year and submitted for the first time a few days ago.
It will come on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of the kind of phone is not fiction.
VMware already conducted the journalist the artphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modeged Nokia N800 with a RAM speech of 128 MB, which was parallelly running the Windows Mobile and Android systems at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is fully trained.
Now the VMware company is together with the Property and Ananian operators at the artphone virtualization and to the customer will come the devices within the year 2012.
Snow lack on the mountains quält the hotel owner
Scneelose pistes make sure that not only the Riesenbergs inhabitants.
The missing snow also disturbs people from the order of the ski holding in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms in the Riesenberg for all winter terms, including Christmas and silver.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but in the middle of them, they are able to order connectively.
And when they call us, they immediately ask us whether our opinion will be at this year's Christmas Festival on Snow or "on Match", the operator of the Snowportal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants the silvester residence in the spindel mixture exactly according to his imaginations should no longer delay with the order.
Whoever prefers the storage and brings the quality of the residence to the second place, may try and wait for a few days.
Intermediately, the spinners of the hotel owners offer only weekly stays for the silver day.
I think that they will try to rebuild them for a long time, but then they will have to leave them, and they will enter in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will run quickly, appreciate Jandura.
Free beds at all winter terms are always offered by the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are interested in most of us in the Christmas Week, which has not yet been delivered.
In our boat, some half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared a number of more precious Christmas stays for the last moment, and the Director of the Travel Office Ingtours, Petr Schifert, has brought up.
The Silver Day in Riesengeberg can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
The good paragraph also finds the first four days in February, the remaining winter terms will be averaged.
This year, the interest in winter residence also affects the negative effect that there is no snow in the Riesenberg.
People wait if snow falls.
No one wants to carry the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pieces are cut within a week, the birthday will also be exhausted, my shift.
Environed and something better than last year, it is possible to occupy the room in the hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're walking about five Pro better than in the previous year.
On Silver Day and Christmas, we have only a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Poland holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada.
To 80 Pro for the silver retention, the hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central park place in Janske Lazne.
Instead, Christmas remains free in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne and the half of beds.
We were surprised in this year of January, for which we are already occupied at the time of about 60 pro.
A little weaker is between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Riesenberg, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, also increased.
A greater snow protection was expected between the riesenberg hotel owners.
On Thursday, it should be cold and if it comes down, it should be on the mountains snow.
But afterwards, a warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: Repeat is a mother of wisdom
It is almost amazing with which the student's striving Barack Obama, the President with the call of the most discreet, repeatedly repeat his preacher in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought to be the most stupid.
When he exhausted his expected afghanistan doctrine, it was shown that he described them on the copy paper from the Busch-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that he used in the text itself several times the "like in Iraq", he even used the name of the Bush Declaration from January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Previously" without deteriorating.
Three years ago, he himself has criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in the Iraq of the civil war - as "unresponsibilityful and in their follow-ups a characteristic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush Strategy, which comes from the military recommendations, was the only possible and very very worth that it was not talking in the news about Iraq today.
The call Bushs was not used by this, because objectively he left the followers a much more grateful outcome situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to rebuild the troop quota, the military officer asked him again, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the customs of subordination, criticized the deteriorating sights in the White House.
He asked 40,000 soldiers to improve the situation.
The President spent three months, but it has not come to a better idea, and thus he has decreased the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed the claim for more 5.000, even if he originally calculated at least 10,000.
The best problem with the whole Obama strategy is his claim to remove the groups from Afghanistan for 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half upheving will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the war of the last years, the Iraqian community is relatively well structured, their leaders respect the values.
The Afghanistan situation is stressed by the contraindication - nobody can leave and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghanistan security forces used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally established correctly, remain only spectacular buildings behind which the patriarchal tribe relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the invisibleness of the situations that continue to complicate Pakistan and Iran influences.
In addition, the building of a "operable state", which is the minimum objective of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Time Horizont of Obama Strategy expelled by his voluntaryism
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only continued to be worse and is now at the border of the explosion.
Thus they believe that the small soldiers who have been broken in the war's voice over the "principious house" creating a miracle here can only create a real romantic soul that doesn't allow it to be impressed by facts.
From the political view, the date setup for the trip is pure responsibility because the Taliban will take it as the indirect consciousness of the discharge.
The latest NATO pipe showed that the preparation of the Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is to be declined.
Europe can be more able and does not want to explain its electors how the security of Germany or Italy is associated with the war in the Hindu-Birg country.
Another possibility that can affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation should continue to be deteriorated and the strengthened sanctions on the Irans should not be affected, the United States will be a very serious question whether the problem is not to resolve with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America calls to Obama to winning from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also be a dramatic turn of the Afghanistan situation.
The only comforter for Barack Obama is the fact that there remains three years until the president's election, and thus still remains enough time to take it into another position, if it would be a total disaster.
The Manager of the Bank Goldman Sachs has no premium boni anymore in bar
The leading forces of the Goldman Sachs Bank have no premiumboni in bar for this year.
This has been announced by the company that responds to the strict criticism of its wage practices.
Instead of money, a group of 30 electron managers receives actions that can be charged in only five years.
Furthermore, the actions can be made to the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Ree’s Agency, is set to the top of the efforts to connect the Premieboni de Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction where it was to go, the former banker of the JPMorgan Society, Douglas Elliott, led to.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the goal of the criticism, after it had approximately 17 billion for the first three quarters of this year.
The total expenditure of the premium boni during this year will probably exceed 20 billion, despite the present measure.
The high premium bones in the banking sector have become the heavyest political subject at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The United Kingdom reported at midweek that it was intended to charge the banking boni of more than 25,000 pounds once with a 50% tax.
Similar steps are also prepared by France.
In this year, women have won the nobel prices in all expert directions, except in physical.
Five recorded women today have taken in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf has taken the current nobel prices in the fax category and for literature.
Besides the four communists, the German writer of Romanian descendants, Herta Mâer, was herein.
The Nobel Price for Medicina has received two ananas biology, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Schostak for research in Chromosone area.
The price for chemicals has received the Israelite Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin forgot the nobel price for the economy, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only physician category in which no woman received a nobel price in this year was physical.
Today, this price has been acquired by Charles Kao for the research in the glass fascinating area and Georgeith with Willard Boyl for the CCD-Chip finding, which is the foundation of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote.
Each of these prices has received the diploma, the nobel media and the certificate on the acquisition of the money price.
It contains millions of Sweden crowns in each category.
If there are several prices in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the President Barak Obama has received the most expected peacenobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he recognized the conflict of his appointment because he was first at the beginning of his way, and also at the top of the country, which leads two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his absence, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary to combat the world peace, even if the price is high for it.
Mr. Janota has been invited by Klaus to the village.
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday early, because he does not agree with the execution of the State budget for the next year in the form of this was released by the Deputy assembly on the middle-week.
It is assumed that the budget and may also the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the Etatde is too high, which continues to deepen the crisis of public funds.
The meeting was informed by the President Radim Ochvat.
About his further staying in his function, Janota wants to negotiate with the Premier, Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives the claus for signing, the Czech Republic should economy with a detail of 163 billion crowns.
However, at the middle of the middle-week, the proposals on the left-party were voted and increased the money for the staff of the State, for the maintenance of the social services and the direct wages of agricultors.
The Government has agreed with the proposals of social democracy that it is covering the budget.
The link party on one side and the Government, the claus and the legal party, on the other hand, has developed a closer internal fight, thus the questionnaire on the further work of the fishermen's officer's officership, which has been agreed with the ODS, CSSD and Green Party in the first year.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidated the package of the stock measures implemented by the fishermen's government in heritage, which, after its understanding, will end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the State budget, but not needs, said today at the breakfast with the undertaking that the people have denewed a longer time the "fair problem", which represents the "inconsistent detention" of public funds.
See the opinion that there is no solution anymore today.
A improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a widespread consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is greedy, and the government should decrease its further existence.
The ODS Steel President, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the Office Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party was obviously not working anymore.
Premier Fisher in the editing included similar words as "stark exhibitions".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek word that it was greedy that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion crowns are over.
In the middle week, the CSSD assessed the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The peoplesparties were also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unsuccessful" of the world shows much from the country, of his battle and victories, despite some critics, that the main role was occupied by an Ananian speech player.
The story relates about sports, race conditions and about Nelson Mandela.
The unnecessary fight against the racial Apartheid Government system in the South African Republic and its first black presidents, Nelson Mandela, presents in his life history of the Oscar Shaw players, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the nineteen-year-old Mandela to present him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role takes Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-year-old speech player, who had received the price for his role in Eastwood-Drama from the box "Million-Baby" box, already placed the leader of the movement to reject the slavery, from which he has become slave-container, a ficticial president of the United States, but also God in "Evan All Power", but only rarely someone who is still read-only and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his activity at the end of the apartment in South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990, and four years ago he became the president of the country.
In 1993, he was exposed to the peacenobel price.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "insufficient", and at the same time it is the name of a deepness of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The request was how to speak
The film skilds a real event in Nelson Mandela, his powers with the Captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pinaire, in order to join the country. The new president Mandela knows that his people are still racial and economically divided after Apartheid.
He believes that he can take some of his people through the sport, so he decides to make some of the rugby players who belong to the outsides worldwide.
The South African team grows up to the 1995 world cook.
Freeman has made several years to bring the Mandela stories to the Chinese invasion.
He had no other goal than playing this role to approach this reality as closely as possible, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The player said that if he and the world politicians were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela and eat with him tonight and be behind his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shoot Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shoot your hand, I take your energy, she's going over, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon represents the film François Pinaire, Captain of the National Rugbyteams, in which the white players have considered.
The shower said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard fucking world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met the pillar for the first time inside the house.
I remember when I sounded to the Turkling that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pinner in my life was: 'In the movie I look much greater'.
Despite the obvious differences in the station of the players compared to their real examples, he has received positive reviews under the leader Eastwood "Invictus: Invictus" leadership and is also spoken of views on a Oscar.
The film criticist of the Daily Variety sheet, Todd McCarthy, gathered his evaluation in the following words: "This was very worth story, very well-exported movie."
In the film reviews on the web pages roottomatoes.com, Invictus 76 Pro received positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway resolved: The Russians tested a rakete
On Norway, a particular light effect was observed unrecognised origin.
The Russian Defence Ministry first agreed yesterday that a intercontinental ballistic racket has been tested near Norwegian border.
But the beginning was not again, and the rackets covered as "Bulava", which would originally be the proud of the Russian army, will become slow to the alptraum of the Russian Generality and the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence at the racket test had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has not been started or been protected in the air.
In the Russian magazines, "Bulava" is already written as "Rakete that doesn't fit".
A raquet that doesn't fit but light
This already 13th trial, lost normal at the beginning.
First at the end of the flight, technical damage occurred on the rakete.
In fact, the engine exploded in the racket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitri Donskij, running under the water of the White Sea.
This type of racket allows the output from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is probably that the mysterious light that caused by an undetermined floating object was actually the protected "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have no doubt since the first moment that it is a Russian racket.
However, the generality has kept up this time and claims that it is not clearly able to speak of a misfortune.
The first two steps of the racket did not fall out and the first steps were only affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were covered in the first stage.
Even if no test starting has occurred without error, the management of the Defence Minister is only six of three for successful.
The nearly fifty percent success is therefore fulfilled by the generality with optimism, and thus continues to say that the "Bulava" will run once without problems and even until ≥ hypershall atom split heads with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow by 51 years
The legendary player Vjaceslav Fetisov represents 51 years again in a Profi Eishockey game.
The former world master, Olympian and Stanley Cup - Inhaber helps CSKA Moscow team in need, and probably already attends the Friday Dual KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his car forty years in 1998, is at the time of the CSKA President.
After Denis Kuljas was hurt, we need another player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will submit the team.
We only need to clothe some other formalities, the AP Agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comback of the famous Eishockey player is only a game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the moral of other players, and Nemcinov's companions.
When Fetisov returns to the iron area, it will be AP of the oldest Russian professional Eishockey game.
In the NHL, the Legendary Sturmer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and was able to write 15 meetings and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most eishockey players in the history.
In the Threeth of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympics gold metals, seven world master titles, and also triumphed in Canada Cup, as well as in the Junior World Mastership.
In the second part of his kare, he also collected success in the NHL, where he bore the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit-Dress.
Since 2001, he has been member of the Eishockey Star room.
Hyundai followed the facilities. All overtimes will be canceled.
The business management of the Hyundai car factory has agreed with the facility on the cancellation of all overtimes.
Because of often assigned overtimes, the facility announced the strike preparation on Monday.
The speaker of the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the business management would like to have some of the business officers on Saturdays in this week.
We should not deny our implementation plan, which is a principle, therefore it was proposed on Saturday, on 19 December, volunteers from the reason that two workers would be carried out, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work Saturday.
They also receive the employees in the afternoon for the Sabbath Saturday of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the type of worker's motivation for the proposed surplus.
Otherwise, they may pay the overtime payment or may take replacement authorisation on 28 December and extend Christmas Festivals, Vanek.
Furthermore, all employees of the Saturday ship will be paid to the car and breakfast.
With regard to the fact that the surplus of the most dangerous and burning point in relation to the requests and complaints of the employees who had established the production last week, the business management decided that last afternoon, with immediate effect on the cancellation of all surplus for December, Vanek took place.
The workers of the car factory were forced to work until the last week, practically every day after the eighth hour.
From the signature of the Agreement, the strike preparation will be revoked from the communities.
Additional negotiations between the operation of the car manufacture and the employees will be held on Friday afternoon.
The company leader, Petr Kuchar, said in the middle of the week that if they are able to sign some of the requests and a common document, they are ready to raise up the strike.
The situation in the car factory has been spent last week, midweek, when approximately 400 employees were spontaneously spent for constant time.
They also protested against the bad conditions of payment and delicate shields.
Nevertheless, the business management believed that the employees needed to make the overtimes to meet the needs of car supply.
The employees also requested in their Monday Preparation Chapter that the employees who had interrupted the production in the previous midnight would not be imposed on any sanctions.
In the area of the overtimes, the facilities call to reduce the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they call for the payment of 5000 crowns in this year.
Hyundai's car factory is now busy for 2000 people.
Serial production was started in the company in November last year.
Until this September, approximately 800,000 vehicles were made here, which are currently 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in HIV virus
The Czech and German team tests new connections to involve the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact is overwhelmed by the consequence that the connection to normal virus variants does not affect as strong as one of the medicines already exist.
AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
However, patients can prolong the treatment of medicines and prevent the increase in HIV virus in the body.
However, your administration is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete disturbance of virus increase also has the development of resistent virus in the result of which no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Academy of the CR Actions, the VSCHT (Chemic-High-School) Prague and the University in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
You have demonstrated that the substances covered as metacarbonate are affected by the egg that is responsible for increased HIV virus.
The metacarbons are connections of bor, water, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block virus increase in other ways than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the workers reached new improved connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the moleculary chhanism of their commitment to the virus white substance.
The metacarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polygonal coppers consisting of bore, hydrocarbon and carbon atmosphere and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homepage and constant virus
HIV protease is egg of HIV-virus, which is indispensable for the vital cycle of virus.
Without the HIV-protease virus collapses, there would be no rare infection virus particulates.
When we disable HIV protease, we also eliminate the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the experts in the press report, issued by the Institute for Organic Chemical and Biochemia of the Academy of the CR's Academy.
In the work held in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the professionals describe the whole series of connections in which two couples of coffee (see Table) are connected by a short organic chain that then is systematicly changed.
Something weaker but reliabler
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagence glass, including against their persistent (resistance) variants gained by HIV-inhibition patients.
The effect of the metacarboran on the usual enzym variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but does not lose their effect on the resistents on which the medicines often are uneffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low dignity and the possibility of further chemical structures make the metacarbons to interesting connections for further research on the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, leader of the structural biological laboratory of the organic chemical and biochemical Institute and the Institute for Molekular Geology of the Academy of the Communities.
Conflict for Budget. ODS went on fishermen who were in charge
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, approved budget for the next year as "grew" and the Government of Prime Ministers of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS was the President of the Minister as "stark debates".
It can be time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of officer cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party was obviously not working anymore.
After Necas, the President must decide whether he intends to guard himself to the minority in Parliament if it is the fight against the increased delusion or whether it is his residence in the Office with the links of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the social democrats to the issue of public defense is dimetrically different, and Necas pointed out.
The European Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 in the middle-week, however, with links parties' amendments on more than 12 billion crowns.
The European Parliament has increased the money for public employees, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
Instead, the Government has agreed with the proposals of social democracy that it is covering the budget.
Czechland should economy with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before voting, so it has followed the Government's desire, because the changed budget is only a less bad variance of the budget providing.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and feeling of senselessness, which Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government has yet evaluated the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with retraction for the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota has been reported to the Premier for Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was discussing his remaining in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment on the negotiations of the budget.
In what ways the fishermen are exposed to the further fight against the Budget De, so that, according to Necas, the nominators of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who have made the changes in the budget, have not done anything in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will return if the Parliament continues to adopt laws that increase the depth, such as the money of the hospital and pensions, or the legislation of the service.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not wrong.
This is the thing of the Prime Minister Fisher and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any errors, Topolanek highlighted in a report from the United States.
It has suggested that in some ministers there are people in a representative function who recognize TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas emphasized that if the fishermen decided to deny the fight against the dealt-height of the public finances, "is perfectly logical and correct that he is able to deal with the left majority currently in Parliament."
Then he cannot consider the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I haven't followed it, and if this is happening, then I will take care of it, the Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, said to the journalists in Parliament.
The Premier Fisher went to the European Council's meeting afternoon to Brussels.
The ODS returned to the desire of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas emphasized that the ODS would probably vote against the changed budget at the middle of the Parliament, if the Prime Minister would expressly request the Members of the civil democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not imagine as waisenkinds, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiation on the budget was rejected by the absence of the president of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't see that my voice would miss.
As soon as I declined to the mandate, I knew that in the next months, it would be a positive reaction to the vote of the Parliament and the decrease of the demand, the Topolanek himself.
Following the new CD (Chechical railway) carrying less moves for the same road price.

For the local movements and for the shipping, the railway has re-compiled a 10-year-old contract until now the contract has always been completed for only one year.
The railway lo ́ the system, may also have not taken the price increase in the large majority of the vehicles.
There are only changes in daily networks CD Net and online eLisks.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is added from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driving stack until now he was united for the trip between any circles and costed 160 crowns.

The history of South Africa relates to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood movie Clint Eastwoods comes in the "Invictus: the Invictus", which includes a part of the life history of the former president of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the worldly famous fighter against the Apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, which has been selected by Mandela himself for some years ago.
The role of the Legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pinaire, received Matt Damon.
The film's starting film will also be sounded by criticians and public reactions.
Nelson Mandela
He named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar price, then in 1993 with the Klerk the peacenobel price.
It was chosen to be president of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the Kinos in a time where the Preparations for the World Mastership in South Africa, on the one hand, but at the same time the media destroy the world public with anxious news about the growing race hazard and the discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority.
According to the News Agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous preservations against the occupation of the main roles with Hollywood Stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud, however, after his own words on the new movie.
I have dreamed from this role for many years and have prepared me well.
More times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I can get his energy, he took up in the interview after the festival premium of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get in this film to Mandela's personality and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it relates to every human, he supplemented.
In the Road of the Rugby National Teams
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin, translated free in the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united portrait the South African Defensor of Human Rights during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman has tried to gather two race-and-day-based population groups, as Nelson Mandela in 1995, in his role in the South African National Rugbyrds in the world cooking field that was at the time of South Africa.
For the arrival of the race in the dress, which is almost as a holy action in South Africa, Mandela grew large Ov, mostly from the white public, and thus won the recognition of the white people.
The Rugby Mastership may make it to join people again to a single people, leading to the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "schorze" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa is improved, that will be shown first.
But the white South Africans are skeptic, for example in recent Interviews for the RN of the Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the United Kingdom.
The Mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
In Louny area, transformators burn for more than 10 million crowns
The brand tomorrow at the Transformator of the Society Ceps in the switch site at the Wiskov community in Louny.
At the brand, the speaker of the district firewahr Usti entered six units at Labem, Luke Marvan.
Originally, the firewall wanted to burn the transformators, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixing of water - shadow and special solvents.
The cause was a technical failure, a transformator internal cycle.
Nobody was hurt, the Haige's officer, according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the security manager of the management system.
The damage was estimated to more than 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be sealed after the fire.
The zero-formed transformator must be replaced by a new, according to Mandadova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps has not happened anything similar to the company, this kind of errors are rare, supplemented it.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, according to the CEZ speaker for North Bohemen, Sona Holingerova, which was not affected by the brand of the trafostation, the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is employed in the Czech area as a sole operator of the management system, the electron guides of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It contains, renews and develops 39 shield plants with 67 transformators, with which the electrical energy in distribution systems and guidelines exceeds 4339 km long.
Jancura's exhibition of penalty for the disappointment against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, has been punishing today because of disappointment against three social-democracy leaders.
On Michal Hasek from the South Sea, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice district and the leader of the district Olomo, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inview in the radio journal.
The complaint relates to the efforts of the company to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we're taking the rosines, and we've just put the boat on the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more closer than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
That's nothing else left for us than refusing us.
Because of this disappointment of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all areas that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
We therefore propose a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the highlight of the penalty for the continued continuation of Jancura's median show, which serves him as free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name and the good call of my territory, and I also call for further leaders.
I assume that it will also be clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional trafficking and uses false and uncertain arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura has already reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in the advertising, which will indicate the negative step of the areas.
He said to the radio journal that he was taking the campaign after Christmas and wanting to continue after the new year.
He claimed that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the areas of the regional railway travel with the Czech railway and had not been issued in charges for the mission at a high level of 150 billion crons.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is legal and in contrast with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of transportation into the areas, Jancura threatened him, even a member of the CSSD.
The only drive was if we didn't disappoint that we could also lose bus licences.
He represented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, he said to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumatic cooks free and voluntary
Inflation against pneumococks changes the habit since January.
It must be the first free and voluntary for the families.
But now the votes are reported that the obligation-implementation would be more effective.
Preparations for the administration of free vaccine against pneumococks.
The medical institution already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that must be paid to hospital insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccine
Vacuums free for August Children
Since January, children can be vaccinated freely against pneumococks born on August 2 and later.
The condition that they have not received a vaccine dose yet.
Those who have started with vaccination in the past year or before must also pay further recovery.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3th and 5th month of life of the child.
A quarter of the families last year impelled their children against pneumococks.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are needed.
In general, the experts estimate that the hospital insurance for vaccine doses of 300,000 to 450,000 crons per year.
However, you save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the State has issued about 500,000 per year for all the surface vaccines of the children.
The obligation vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause medium-inflammation, but also severe infections of brain infections and blood infections.
Pneumocock infections cause us to die after study in hospitals per year up to 28 children in age to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the obligation to implant children against pneumococks was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination be obligation?
At the same time, this vaccine may be future obligation.
Since January, these shall be paid by the insurance and will be voluntary.
That the obligation-implementation would be better, for example, the leader of the Civil Association of Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association we have already long-termly for the pneumocock vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, at which we were associated, were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have been able to do it at least.
I think that's the way we need to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine procedure against pneumococks.
At this point, we don't do this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its deficiencies, said the doctors.
The president of the professional company of practical children's doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has their deficiencies.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think of the decreasing number of repeat vaccines, "In a situation in which the vaccine is so bigger, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has been started as voluntary," however, Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80% of the parents to implant their kids against pneumococks from the next year.
The vaccination against pneumatic cooks is also increasing in that this is payable as the first surface vaccine by the hospital insurance and not by the State.
The insurance should expend the money for the prevention to save them for further treatment, obtained by Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, an anxiety of practical children's doctors related to the purchase of vaccines is linked.
The vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members threatened that the insurance could "export the money from the hospital insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to purchase the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pays them.
According to the rates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son shared in "Mouse Deepstle"
The son of the famous Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of stealing records from his father's museum in the value of 20 million.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was invited by 90 cars in his vehicle with an attachment.
It means Frank Frazetta Junior and another man had used a bagger to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of designs such as Conan of Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Press, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP cited an unexpected police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family failure.
The Agency reported, according to a police-in-local statement, Frazetta Junior said, he was told by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The Agency shared that Frank Frazetta Senior decided to have granted any authorisation.
Laboratory defends eating and control increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and delays given in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economy and communities.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have allowed a "repeat" opportunity to show that he was seriously thinking about the reduction of the deœts by making the decisions out of the election.
The tax officer also decides that he aimed at workers with low and medium-income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social insurance and a 1 percent capture limit for the public salaries for 2011.
Social insurance damage
However, the communities have protested that low-glon recipients will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned against future "problems".
The highlighting of the social insurance, at approximately 3 billion British pounds per year, has enhanced the economy, which states that this is a tax on workplaces, although the attention should be on economic relief.
The increase limited to those who deserve more than 200,000 £ per year will take place about 10 million workers.
EXPONDENT OF THE PROVISION
Increasing social insurance by more than 0,5 % from April 2011
In this year, the economy's growth of more than the expected 4,75 %
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 Increasing corporate taxes for small companies
Fisheries for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increasing State pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the treasure, a person with an annual revenue of 30 000 £ per year will be poorer and a person with 40,000 £ per year will be poorer than 190 £, while a person with 10,000 £ annual income will be richer than 110 £.
The Ministers said that their goal of depthing was "delicate decisions" until 2013, but they also said that 60% of the charges of additional tax would fall to the 5% of the top-servidors.
The Minister of Finance Stephen Timms decided that the skizzied tax increases and delay stops, compared to the necessary measures "a troop on the heat stone".
"There are big numbers. They will bring us the deformation and this is also necessary during the period of the next four years," he shared the BBC.
Timms said he was convinced that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
The laboratory party's predicts on the future economic growth – which affect the volume of the new debt and the difficulty of the debt - were asked after the tax cancer was forced to revise previous numbers.
He said in his opinion that the economy would probably be broken by 4.75% in this year - more than the decrease of 3.5% that was foretold in April – while the debt would be of 3 billion £, than previously suggested.
"Forged opportunity"
The conservatives who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn before the "School Crisis" of Labor said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds for the next six years would be uncontainable.
They say that the Ministers have refused to present a reliable plan, how they will repay this and press "kinish" before difficult decisions until the election - which must be located at the latest in June 2010.
"You haven't said anything about what they're going to do," said the shadow minister Philip Hammond. "You have had their opportunity to do this, and they have left them."
"The significant announcements are made only after the choice, whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Laboratory is concerned that schools, hospitals and police are kept before future shortages, other than in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the depopulation coming faster and easier.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and deficiency stops will be used to cover the depths for the next year, not to reduce the depth, and thus arguing that the plans were "build on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that some of the things at the date of notifications - such as the above inflation adjustment to some invalid rents in April Next - would extract the tax cancer to the prospect of voting, since the money could be recovered in the next year.
Laboratory is intended to provide extra assistance when people need it and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Holer Stat"
Although the Ministers have not provided any details about 2011, the economics say that the pressure on the public issues will only come to the middle-term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Research said that the numbers of the tax cancer would mean powerful deficiencies in many areas, possibly future in transport, high school, environmental and defence areas.
"It's just to reduce the pain on later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are made only after the choice whoever wins it," Roger Bootle, economic advisers in the economic examination undertaking, Deloitte.
"This was only the high preab status report, the markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "American citizens' arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the deceit of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were shared in a house in Sarghoda, in the Pandschab province, when they were overcome in a house in Sarghoda, the Spanish news was shared in the Pakistan of the BBC.
The FBI said that it would be investigated whether these were the same men who were missing the last month in the United States of Virginia.
The US Foreign Minister said that they were also looking for information about men.
Three of them must be Pakistanic descendants, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Jemenitic background.
"If they are State citizens, of course, we are very interested in the points of accusation that will be preserved to them and in which circumstances they will be held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed of the arrests and was connected with the families of the missing students.
"We work together with the Pakistan authorities to find out their integrity and the purpose of their neighborhood, if they really are the missing students," she said.
The Pakistanic message in Washington told that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the domestic police had already been interested in the house before, and that has not yet been charged against the men arrested.
The News Agency Reeh reported that foreign minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States had to "coop more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eliminate the terrorism infrastructure, which continues to recruit and educate people".
The five students were reported as missing by your families in Northern Virginia.
Amnesty condemned "mislebrushes" in Iran
According to a report of the Human Rights Organization of Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was struck and burned with cigarettes.
The Iran rejected his former criticism of human rights.
Official authorities said that such criticisms were politically motivated.
After the attacked election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed tens, which led to the largest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Tens received prison penalties and accusers said that at least five people were condemned to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the Protest of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the misuse claims and organized the closing of the Kahrizak staff.
But since then, there was no more tolerance from the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False consciousness"
Amnesty International cited the report of the 26-year-old informatic student Abraham Mehtari, who said he was accused of the "work with Facebook networks" and the protest against election results.
"They killed me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my naked, on my head, and they threatened me with death and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a misunderstood and became, still blue and half unconscious, released on the street, divided Amnesty with.
Mehdi Karroubi, a pre-Presidency candidate, said that some demonstrants, captured after the election, were followed to death in August in prison, and others were violated.
The Iranian authorities denied the immigration projects, but admitted that misuse had been located.
Amnesty also called the case of an earlier prison, who said that he was arrested with 75 more than eight weeks in a container in a crime in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judges had established a committee that should investigate the injuries after the election and reactions of the Government, but that Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these bodies would not have been clearly published and the results obtained by the Parliamentary Committees were not published.
The group said that at least 90 persons were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to convert a sign to Bristol into a whistleway.
The Skipistes of this park event introduced 16 half-professional skinners and Snowboarders who were fighting for money prices.
On the top of the hang in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short sprinkhance at the beginning of a 100 meters long hang.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicals in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful corner of the hangs, but it was also very beautiful.
It's a great cup with all the lights of the city that shield under.
He adds: "There are some of the best ski-boarders and Snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were granted for the best in the hands of arts or tricks.
After the event on Thursday, the snow will be left to the snow.
Always they and we
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a sungular state.
In one time, the Swiss electors voted for a construction offer for Minarates and the concern for the common islamisation of Europe was spread, John Bowen, an Ananian academic, wrote a funded and well-term report on whether Muslims can be integrated in one of the most explanatory communities of Europe.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French don't love the heads" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) a elegant and closely argumenting question that the country shared and employed and remained still today.
Both the latest book offers a comprehensive and stronger spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what the more and the media are saying about the Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He has spent months in Moscheen, Schools and Institutes, now 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most difficult.
Should a muscle marry in a moschee or race (or both)?
Should young muslims learn about evolution and homosexual rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-muslim man?
Is it permitted for a muslim to use a rental-oriented banking system to get a hypothek?
These appear to be profane issues, he claims that make the daily life, in contrast to the political drames that the media are occupied.
The author recognises a new generation of owners, teachers and intellectuals, no one of them with a name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, one of the Arab Muslims and Academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good moslem, and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern s mundan society.
You don't have any arguments on their side.
Conservatives are insufficient to the idea of a French or islam.
The thoughts and activists who asked Bowen are mostly uninformed with their salafi gears – the criminals of purist Sunnith Islam, which are connected to Saudi Arabia – today show a small, but influent presence among the European Muslims.
Bowen is the view that Muslim values and French Sglieularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a gift and take on both sides.
He questions how French political decision-making (and the intellectual elite that so sufferingly observes the training of church and state) really is committed to pluralism.
He states that Muslims may have had to learn more rough treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with the sëulary Republicanism.
He would like to recognize a "decrease of values" as a growing practicism.
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, you are intended to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The world’s most unconfortable view
The arctic changes faster and dramaticer than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she knows smiles with alarming speed and takes life with herself that can never survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, ship carriers and fisheries interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomates, advocates and now authors in their kitchen waters.
Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, is in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the North, the icebar.
It describes the long tradition of the arctic researchers who have proved themselves on the iron in the jail.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a iron bargain as a 14-year-old farmer to the sea, who only struck with his muscle's weapons, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears captured when they weep behind their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circus.
In the early 20th century, a circus assembly showed 75 iron bars at a presentation.
Even today, zoo facilities are still typically a million of the live area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the iron in Singapore has become very green by the algens that grow in the high hair of his pels.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often turns back to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Despite the prohibition in Norway, America and Russia, the establishment in Greenland and Canada continues to use hunters in helicopters and engineering-driving inuit powerful storm weights to draw their beefs.
Ironically, the iron will remain in the north of these two jailers.
In the new book "After the ice" (After the Ice) Alun Anderson, an ancient publisher of the New Scientist magazine, provides a clear and disturbing description of the arcticity and a packing view of how the future could be developed.
It's not the case that creators have all answers.
Neither atmosphere scientists nor oceanographs can declare the properness of changes.
However, this is not a lack of claiming attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century led to the confusion of the empire for the first time.
Subsequent ships meet in the cold war the moving grace in the department.
A useful complement is satellite measurements and the superfluous exhibition of iceberg salts, but many are still achieved by the immortal people who camp outside in the coal.
Anderson puts a corner into the own, winziful world of the fluid system within the arctic iron, which is designed by saltwaterrinsal, which are together in the frozen.
But, starting from the iron on the iron to the microscopical small wonders in iron, all of them are threatened when the summer is over, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, we could be"
Marine infanterists were among the 6.000 in Arlington Kronne
The hostel free De'Angello Robinson spent seven hours with the bus to put a single cronn on the grave of a soldier he never had met.
For him and the other marine inventors who traveled by Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington, to cut the graves, the day was a tribut to men and women in their footsteps.
In a few months, from where we are always brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to eat the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6.000 volunteers who had gathered themselves on Saturday morning to put cronces on the graves of veterinarians in several sections of the Arlington F’hof.
Morrill Worcester, inhaber of the grief creationist Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, founded 1992 this tradition, when he and some others decided to decorate a few hundred graves on the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take these travels every year, stand in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also found a useful organization, Wreaths Across America (Crannces in all America), which also extended the event to other countries.
In this year, more than 16,000 volunteers put on the graves on the Arlington-Fhof, in areas of the Pentagon, on the graves of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the memory site for the United Airlines Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent for the second time more than 150,000€ for the purchasing and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had taken the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a disrupted professional soldier.
Although her husband is not prepared in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to civilians to submit our soldiers.
It's like the clue of a family burst.
Packed in the lay of warm clothing, the volunteers weared over the expanded race areas and the hills of the Friedhof.
The volunteers had older tombs from the 1st and 2st World War and the Vietnam war as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer tombs, as the enemies.
The vote was joyful, playing children, and the couple stood on their hands while wearing the fresh kidneys to the grassing grave stones.
Each round cranz was dark blue with a small red slice fixed on the top.
The section 60, which is near and where most of the veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost happy.
The United Services Organizations spent 1.000 Krennces to smile this section, but the darkest vote of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Some weeped openly, prayed, and families and friends stayed in the iron air.
Some read the names set in the stone, while others moved to small black-white cards, which had been stuck for those in the flashing lamps whose graves have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot the bitter tears before her son's grave.
She was conducted 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the bursts of the Marine Infrared Marine undertone of David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free, my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm not longer, I want someone to remember him."
Deputy of the US Government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has approved a contractor of the US Government, the mobile phone and the notebook computers in the country, saying the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The employer, who could not be identified until now, for development alternatives Inc. with sitting in Bethesda.
The company is at projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S.A. for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officer of the United States interest representation in Havana attempts to get access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The special complaints have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign person can be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of the "valuation".
All the so-called counterrevolutionary A ́s, including easily protestant and critical writings, are a risk of arrest.
Governing enemies and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Kuba has a growing blogger community called by the reporter Yoani Sánchez, who describes the way she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested a licence to leave the country to gain prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an ananas will probably increase the spending between the Communist Government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama Government, which had a "slow" approach to improve the relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times Friday night.
The new US policy implies that the United States will be opposed if the Cuban Government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, despite being new and desired products in a country in which the average debt of a governmental employee is 15° per month.
The Cuban Government only allows normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used highly to send text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in customs hotels and there for foreign visitors and for some government institutions such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the Government.
Too many websites access is limited.
On Cuba, the arrest of a American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting for crimes like swimming bags behind the grids, Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US interest representation in Havanna.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and the prison are clearly wrong.
A activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, leader of the Ananian Section of the Group "Human Rights Watch", which recently reported a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", an example of the establishment of Raul Castro as leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the complaints were very often arrested, condemned and arrested within one day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States just at the time that both countries move for more dialogue preparation.
Pakistan government representatives covered plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistan authorities discovered a fairly leading head of a disturbance that aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist procurers who seek the Internet for radicalized young men.
Experts said that they had searched for an invisible rebelian, as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of these comments agreed on the Internet videosite YouTube on terrorists.
Saifullah, after their arrival to Pakistan, became the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribe cave, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah was not able to convince Al-Kaida leaders that men were not part of a disturbance to submigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the spectacular city of Sargodha for days, far away from the inherent mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were viewed as part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government officer who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officer said that the men were no way disappointed and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to access the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistanian criminals.
The case of five men - who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the decision of the prosecutors in the Implementation of future terrorists and perhaps even more important in the decision of who is trustworthy.
Since the applications of 11 September 2001, the US secret service has made a thing of greater difficulty to submit human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The prosecutors of the organization are acting as a portent, which does not include those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wilger recruites are subject to a special examination by A Kaida, said analytics.
As a result of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be adequately attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, an aggressive analytical of the NEFA functioning with a seat in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more careful in the past years in view of who they have offered access because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to include someone in these groups, what better way can you go than to follow the recruitment model, which so many have already been followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now a lot more based on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrants request in Copenhagen climate "Action"
Ten thousand demonstrants marched here on Saturday through the streets and requested by the subhandlers at the Bella Congress of the city of more powerful action on climate protection.
Demonstrants said that 100 000 people had joined the event, but the police assessments were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful masked activist burned small snapshots near some government buildings in the city.
On one day, when climate negotiations promoted by the United Nations were few, thousands of activists with transparencies in the city "There is no plane B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the photograph Helena Christiansen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of their mother's homeland, would realize the problems that the country had to face because of the existing effects of climate change.
This is part of the movement foundations why I decided to be part of the great demonstration - to continue the word and to call on the world leaders to make a right, ambitionated and binding agreement, she said.
It is not easy to do, but it has to be done now and there is no more way to run it.
The police stopped the demonstrators to reach too close to the Bella center and said that they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because they were masked or brought to cocktail.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstration.
According to a viewer who did not want to be called because he was involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrants in black clothing were thrown in a number of spring bodies near Copenhagen's main channel, with several ministers nearby.
They threw them near the building, he said, and added that they started as light races, but then followed by "may big explosions".
Inside the Congress room, people gathered themselves in front of television images to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has not seemed to reach the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's main climate trader.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration had an effective effect on the international discussions, he answered the English, "This is something I didn't know."
Then he continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the event is large, I can't hear what's outside."
He determined that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the convergence of the broad public and various sectors on the theme of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they have the negotiations or the freedom of others."
Test data show hard-night race cloft
The testimony on mathematical performance was the last week Welcome News for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, the highest performances show that the fourth and eight-year Classers have made faster progress in the past two years than towns, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest numbers of national evaluation of the educational progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hard-level efficiency club between African and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average point of the white quarter clases from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 in the last two years (at a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance club has actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American Acht Classer remained the same as that he fell on a statistically deteriorable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data because the sample range was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also inconfortable.
The white and black chairer separated 2003, when the first NAEP was found in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that have reached both groups has grown up in this period, the difference with 58 points now has not been reduced.
Some educational works for the district last week expressed their concern that the results of school cancer Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic citizen Adrian M. Fenty have been offered to the largest part of white students who are also strong children.
This indicates that we have highlighted the total assessment by the treatment of those at the top of the scale, which is difficult and difficult, Jeff ́ith, a representative member of D.C. Voice, a useful group, which is involved in the equality of education in Washington D. C.
I didn't go up to a span of two or three points and below, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Base School.
Brown, a frequent criticist of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the media schools of the city need to be careful.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect it.
But I am afraid that we do not use the time and energy that we have to use for our school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to be justified by the needs of the weak students.
In this herbst, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson reading system, which aims at students in the top classs of the basic school and the high school, which have not understood the basic ability of reading at the beginning of their school course and that is significantly behind their equal classmates.
Today Mateo, a teacher schedule, which was declined from the child garden to the sixth class games and livelihood experiences in front, was written under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey to Washington, and this teacher plan will be given some of the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I think that we must continue working to allow the best measures to benefit the students who are under the note level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the system's total performance and can continue to provide social money and resources for the weak schools that are necessary to reduce the cloud.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor for Education at the Property of California in Berkeley, which is investigated by the stately examination results.
The conventional health means to address its resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could lead to political reactions that work against this important agenda point.
The weakest point is, of course, as in other state-school indicators, that it is trying to keep the white and black media.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a great school system.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city quarters so that all families, independent of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a schoolinspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closing of the performance club is to extend the traditional public school year in Washington currently 180 days to competite with the Charter Schools.
In order to have the strength to change the school year, Janey, who came with his teacher work last year to a agreement over 185 days per year, which he viewed as "a milenstein" on the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a sound pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, grows up and blinks a moment in view of the white columns, the green stones and the smaragd green race.
Gracielas parents almost completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was stored in Silver Spring and now in Riverdale le日, had never put a foot on a college-camp.
Their attitude and the other eight-classers of the group, the Gettysburg, where the education costs 38.690 per year, were more than one of the fearful and an enthusiastic students in the future.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" Graciela, who wants to study medication when the leader announced that they had now attended the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was reported to her the low school-professor-to-student-relation.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited at their three-day tour and now they completely collected the message: The question is not whether to go to the college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing care about the large number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States, who do not end the high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the school training that is necessary to rise into the media.
In fact, one of the five of these "two generations" of the Spanish Americans concludes the college – which is a significant performance because many of their immigrated parents, most of Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without finishing the high school.
Their successful stories are important, says researchers, because they show the way for a generation that will play a great role in the workers of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children often say that they have a natural deficiency for the school and an inhabiting facility for success.
Parents also have high goals to their children and find ways to improve their lack of confidence with schools.
But advice programmes also play a great role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you consider income weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in searching through the system, a single measure will not at any time solve the problem, Patricia Gándara, researcher in the of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a under-school network for these children from the pre-school to the high school.
The Federal Programme, which Gracielas College Tour financed, is a useful example.
It is GEAR UP - a turnover - and provides more than 300 million per year for local school systems to start school preparation programs that start when income weak students are in the school and continue until they have finished the high school.
According to the United States Education Department, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, from which more than 60% have been attended.
The Iraq Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite meditating on violence and political instability, the Iraqian Government can bring greater oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two events concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraq Oil Ministry draw close to the fact that China, Russia and Oil Company are prepared to play a important role in the renewal of the Iraq Oil Industry, which has been incurred for years by war and economic sanctions.
America's companies only were able to buy shares in two of the 10 increased fields.
Seven-year-old companies paid for the participation of the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has given a command has made the shorter.
Two annual companies could conclude contracts for increased fields in June.
The Danish representatives of the Oil Mult in the opening of the Iraq Oil Industrie surprised the analyses.
The Iraq finally opened his gates after 6 years, and instead of US enterprises present Asian and European routes, Ruba Husari, publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said a online news service.
There will be no more boats in Iraq for a long time.
Safety thoughts that were still underlined by massive coordinated bombing on Sunday and political instability by the discharge of the US military have probably detained from the Oil Society, thus analysts said to engage more in Iraq, which is the most proof of the world's oil reserves.
U.S. companies were in some cases noted because competitors, especially the Chinese and other Stately controlled energy undertakings, have clearly less loans and are more risked because they do not have to pay account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and O­al Petroleum Inc. were the only companies of the Ananias who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US enterprises such as Chevron and ConocoPhips, who have close relationships with the Iraq Oil Minister and have been with the technical Council in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed on this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure himself with his partners and will fulfil his obligations against Iraq.
In order to increase the exhaustion of each field over the current level, the firms selected for orders, which were then compared to taxes per Barrel oil, which were ready to devote the Ministry.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US rates attack at the Pakistan frontier to Afghanistan, this week has been killed a top intervention planner of Al Kaida, as reported by the representatives of the U.S. terrorism combat on Friday.
This would be, if it would be known, the second death attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this inheritance.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistan authorities, were killed by a number of rackets who met their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in North-Wazstan.
The local authorities reported that the rackets were discharged by a type of drone that was placed by the ≥ in the unlawful tribe of Pakistan.
They moved into a white vehicle towards the Afghanistan border, when the car was found, a government representative of a Pakistanian civil secret service from Miran Shah by phone said.
The local seats who were in deceit to belong to the Military were running to the place and quickly took all that was left of the "completely zealous bodies".
The local authorities were not able to identify the performance of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorism combat proved that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leader of the military planner of Al Kaida, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan region.
He was shared in pollution throughout the world, a leader who wanted to remain anonymous, and refers to the heavy character of the American air attacks on Pakistan.
If you accept his central role as given, it would also include the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second representative of the authorities said that Somali was quickly increased in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had better connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He doesn't like to be some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this doesn't reduce the figure he represented for us and our associates.
If his death had been killed, Somali, the second leader Al Kaida or Taliban, who was killed since September, would have been killed as in a similar attack of Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribe territory and three other topactivists.
The time of attacks through the drums of the .. has been returned from a average of six operations per month to two, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of the websites discussed by an organization that is useful.
The reduction may be based on improved terrorist group tactics, taking steps to decrease their accuracy and killing the informants who are at the same time in demand, reported the page.
UN leader in Kabul will be returned
The leader of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that it would be returned by the Office in March, which would end a storm official period, which would have been disrupted by broad corruption by the Afghanistan presidential election supported by the United Nations.
It has been done when the Obama Government has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations messenger said that he supported the creation of troops, but he also pointed out his thinking that the United States Army Return Plan, which will begin in 18 months, could urge other NATO governments to remove their fighting forces.
We must accelerate the building of the Afghanistan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghanistan that they can trust the international community, said Ide in a Kabul phone interview.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diploma also forced the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil aids to help the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The elevation of troops on the military side must match an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lay down his office, but only in March 2008 he took up an agreement with his family to stay in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the United Nations notice.
General Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he may have time to take care of a replacement.
What I said is that he's better starting looking for a follower, said Ide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the walk of my preacher and my arrival.
Ban, according to the United Nations representatives, began searching for a replacement.
The United Nations representatives say that he has taken into consideration the Swedish-Italian Staffan di Mistura, which has recently led the United Nations mission in Bagdad and has taken into consideration the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously conducted UN-F operations.
Eye position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to dismiss evidence of massive election.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - that was devoted - "the mission had no doubt damage, because it has already been a large measure of scepsia in relation to international mixture in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the support measures of the combat forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the UN leadership allows followers to set more staff from the United States and other western countries for the Afghanistan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the use of their money correctly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his powers in Afghanistan and said that the United Nations environmental setting arrangements had undergone its possibilities to bring capable people in.
The United Nations rules have been made so that I've been able to set up only one person since May.
This is a catastrophe, and it can't continue so.
U.S. Defence Minister Gates: Iran needs to be counted with associated sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon "significant sexual sanctions" over Iran because he did not share talks about his atmosphere.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in Northern Iraq during a seven-day trip through the military areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, and played a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said as an answer to the question of a soldier on the probability of such development.
"One thing that lies on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is an inpredictability of the war."
The Obama Government is a sanction package in the establishment that aims at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions may also affect the average.
He said that a "Package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less disturbed with nuclear weapons, because "Your people will suffer more increasingly under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a opinion of the white House speaker, Robert Gibbs, the Government of the Ananian, joined the top politicians in warning that the Iran must consider "credible" consequences if he does not comply with the requirements of the United Nations Security Council and its Atom Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of the nuclear technology should be won only for peaceful purposes.
In the discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the talks to restrict his atom programme and would distort to a major part of his stock in the exchange of a driving needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reaction.
The US Government has forced this type of agreement to build the confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since this time -- in part, experts say because the Iranian lead is aware of whether they should be committed to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community in respect of some proposals which they have already agreed in early October, it has, openly said, the international community, the Russian and Chinese, has said, in a way as they have never been in relation to important social sanctions for Iran.
President Obama decided on 31 December to respond to these proposals before he continued to follow other options to those called for foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "expressive sanctions".
In a opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation in the United States N° condemned what she called on Thursday "baseless and unfunded arms" of certain secure Council members to the Iranian atmosphere and said that they were ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who should return to Washington on the last Friday, met the Iraq Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on the morning before he fled into the Olive Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The spending between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continues to be high, in terms of limits, ownership rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates forced both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays of the US plans to reduce the tropical force to the end of August from 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to spread the Kurdish care about the future trip. US representatives cited gates, which was in Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Government, said: "We will receive your security, your welfare and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
An adjustment in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband were growing around from propaganda-placates, who said to them that "Mother Earth is too tired to talk to other children" and "A baby more means more a grave."
These lessons have learned so well that, as government officer in Shanghai, who, through the low birth rates and the older people in this summer suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was directly and finally: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child policy in China, which produced two generations of notorially delicate, individual children, who lovely are called “small Caesar”, is a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate falls to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 on the date of entry into force, the United Nations reports:
The Department for People's Affairs is determined while the number of population groups of 60 years and elderly in 2020 from 16,7 per cent of the population to 31,1 per cent will increase in explosion by 2050. This is largely over the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The inequality is stronger in low coasts with a designed population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 years of age and age, almost 22% of the reported resident Shanghais, while the rate of birth has been placed under a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, leader of the Shanghaier city population and family planning committee, said that couples in the age of children need to be born "to help to reduce the proportion of older populations and to reduce the lack of work forces of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not so rich -- like the industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual rest
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's single-child policy may be the most conflicting availability that was introduced by the Governing Communist Party until today.
Married couples who have committed this must be counted with a huge penalty -- until their three-fold annual amount in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
The Chinese State representatives have said that the critical accusation of natural resources could be avoided, which condemned human rights-represented misuse in the implementation of the country.
In rural regions, some officials of pregnant women who have already had a child have been forced to take away.
Moreover, couples have allowed sex-selective deteriorations, which resulted in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually distorted their attitude towards a child policy.
In 2004 they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- urban residents, ethnic minorities and cases in which both husbands and wife were single children -- and 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was decreased.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research of the University of Peking, said that government representatives have recently discussed more radical changes, for example, to set up two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was started in July to the first Chinese city, which started an aggressive campaign to promote more birth.
Placates that taught families to have only a child were replaced by almost a night of directives that detailedly describe who comes to question for a second child and how to apply the approval.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than a child.
The response was not just encouraged, said family planning representatives.
Disappointed Reaction
Although officers from a rural small town in Shanghai's foreign areas said that an exciting is to recognize the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, however, the state areas do not report any change.
In the community of Huinan with 115 000 residents, only four to five applications are made for example each month.
Disappointed Shanghaier officers say that the number of births in the city for 2010 will still lie at approximately 165.000 -- a little more than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, leader of the Shanghai's family planning committee of Caolu, said that financial advantages are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give her first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also lawfully allowed.
But, as many Chinese, they are only a lowly illness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be unresponsibilityful.
Western people evaluate the single child policy falsely as human rights issue, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we'll be able to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a position.
The problem is money.
Other couples provide psychological reasons for their heads.
Wang, the staff leader, said she wanted only a child because she was a single child. "We were the centre of the family and habited that everyone cared about us.
We're not used to care for others and don't really want this."
Chen Sieian, a 42-year-old, who belongs to a translation undertaking, said that it was more confused.
For parents from the Mediterranean with double cars, through which the rate of birth decreases, he said that it turns to be it and that it must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20-39-years grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiments, and they wouldn't want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also, a single child, he said, puts great requirements in the time of the parents.
A mother must leave her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is nine months old, you have to have a life course for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to do this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one that has reached a life standard, he said.
We don't want to offer too many sacrifices.
UN Group designates a plan for reducing emissions
The climate conference promoted by the United Nations — which has yet been exhausted by wild posts and mutual accusations — has set a focus on the release of a document on Friday, which will bring an enormous decrease of the gases for the next 40 years, while the industry must cultivate the largest burden in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the management of gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was viewed as a major progress in a negotiation that takes time, since the next week more than 100 policies from all the world will come to Copenhagen.
The text, which has been formulated by a United Nations working group in its own manner, is aware of the amount of money that the poor countries should give to the poor countries so that these are able to meet the global heating short and long-term.
It also provides a palette of options for key issues, such as industrial and big weaknesses, and how high the highest level of global temperature growth should be with the political decision-making.
The process will provide great flexibility, so John Coequyt, leader of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has discovered the six-side document, has collected a 180-page long negotiation text to put it in the centre of what the leading representative of the United Nations climate protection, Yvo de Boer, has considered as "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of a possible agreement, in which the industrials together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while greater developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
The countries together could reduce the emissions to 2050 by 50 to 95 Pro.
The European Community also provided the discussions on Friday, by providing an insurance of 3,6 billion dollars per year over the next three years, to undermine poor countries to adapt the impact of the climate change - from the masters of overcoming and drying to the avoidance of destruction.
On Friday, however, the same verbal fireworks, which had been determined by the talks in the last week.
The climate commander Todd Star has refused forms to reject the binding reductions of gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger lands, if they are not financed by the industry.
This train announced that Obama's government was driving a stronger line with China as a representative of the Bush Government two years ago.
The United States will not undertake agreements without taking greater sweet countries and taking measures, so that stars, which also claimed that the text is not far enough to ensure that the tensions could also be affected by external residents.
Stars gave his opinion a hour after the statement of the Chinese Vice-President He Yafei, who said that it had lacked the leader's climate operator either "the understanding" or that it was "the highest unresponsibility" of him that he said the beginning of the week that the United States would not help financially to meet the global heating.
As the future economic marketing of the large world powers is on the game, both within the industry and between the industry and the Sweden countries have opened breaklines.
The current battle relates to the salvation of individual economys, as well as the salvation of the planet, while China and the United States have committed their respective obligations, while poor countries claim that the two thousand most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting the costs of breaching of the gas gases, since even the countries concerned have been overtaken, would be aggressive to take the countries with a very high cost for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic predecessor, such as Ulate, which is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that have been most exposed to the impact of climate changes have shown that they would continue to fight for a legal agreement in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small islands with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Arturge-Metcher, leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island countries "exercise political pressure on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and requested measures from the Sweden countries such as China and India.
The discussions had a new difficulty when the delegates had been able to address the fact that most open issues needed to be raised before the Governing leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-range representatives such as the Indian Ministry of Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Viceministers, departed from their aircraft and traveled by the Bella Center to meetings closed behind doors and press conferences in order to distract those negotiated during the next week.
The pure amount of the congregation -- 13.000 people go to the Congress every day, and the gitarr-replaying activists perform nightly shows in which they make themselves fun over the countries who are trading and replaced by their opinion, and contract projects are continued manually instead of by email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: Almost all important ministers are here and from midnight will be 60 Governing leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Conservation Organization International.
The heavy weights come.
British first 225 km/h faster train defines the feeling of Monday
On Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13, a pipe will cross the darkness in order to announce a travel carrier representing a revolution in the United Kingdom.
The first high speed-speed travel in the country will be reached at its journey by Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and returned 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Defense, then Mrs. Kelly Holmes will go on the board of the first Javelin Pender service from London.
He hopes that the new British service will finally connect to a international shopping force, quicker, reliable moves, and will connect the large areas of Midland, North and Scotland to London.
The deteriorated province could be living penalty, worktimes would be radically reduced and the exchange of aircraft and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and waste on the roads.
In the theory, the three large parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds that are needed to build a new national shield network, the inevitable planning struggle and threats on environmental damage could still take the brake in the British high speed lights.
High Speed Two (HS2), a establishment founded in January, which will be presented by the Government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December.
This provides a detailed drawing card of the next planned level of high speed network.
The new travel line to connect London to the West Midlands will lead to a five-metric playspace in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is restricted.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final range.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northern leading high speed screen.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the early days.
The preferred option is a y-formed stream management, which would lead a single high speed stretch to West Midlands.
The streams would share in or near Birmingham and a refresh would lead the peninsula to Manchester and Scotland westly and another towards the North East to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway inside.
After finishing, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be decreased by 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first sub-line that would not be opened before 2025 would allow the travelers to return the streak of London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, comparing something to today over a hour.
The drafts provide the opportunity to move with a speed of 400 km/h, which will make the British shining breeding the fastest Europe.
The first piece was scheduled so that 400 meters long moves with a maximum capacity of 1.100 persons can lead to it.
Up to 18 moves could be operated by hour on the London Birmingham streek.
This would mean again that there would be a final station in London, which could be transferred on the 200,000 travellers per hour.
In view of the space restrictions in the capital city, it is expected that an existing trainhouse would be built to undertake the high speed network.
Travel experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston has this potential.
Lord Adonis will indicate whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the talkers, the shining knife must be built in sections.
The moves should first change from the high speed lines to existing streets in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This applies as a decision-making point in order to ensure a shift from the aircraft to the train, a measure for the shift revolution.
Tax payers come for hypothek for 75,000 pounds of a conservative organisation
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the conservatives, has taken into account the tax payer per year thousands of pounds for the costs of an orangery that he is building in Wohnhaus in ○ election circle.
The prison speaker of the party degraded by David Cameron because he complained that the sub-house members must live "by the magic R". He has increased his hypothic at 75,000 pounds to build a wooden farm building at his second house in Ruthland.
He was able to take account of the payer’s social interest agreement, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The responsibles of the sub-house have approved the applications at that time, and they have not been asked by Sir Thomas Lee, who has carried out a review of the issues of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could be "not yet cleaner or understander".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-human members, is a double house in a village in a village in the Rutland and Melton election circle.
In the nearby households, they have achieved a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The earthquake includes kitchen, residence and eating rooms, but the fees Office, a door control site of the underhouse, agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has built a winter garden that is in the plans "Orangeria".
Neighbors described him as a "Glass House for Entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee for Standards and Privileges during a recent investigation of its previous hypotechnological contracts to take position to enhance funding.
The Committee freed it from the breakdown of the rules last month after an exam of its issues.
2004 Duncan has covered the security for a hypothek more than 27000000 pounds (300,000 euros) from London house to his election circle, which he has cooked a year before his election to the member of the parliament.
This week, published documents show that Duncan has returned about $1.400 to March last year (1.500 euros) per month as a return of hypothecence.
In April, its applications increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The RBS RBS rate has not changed during this time, thus enlarged the total increase in the financing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
In December 2007, the normal RBS-free hypothecence falled from 7,94 Pro in December 2007 to 4 Pro in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the sub-house show that Duncan continued to make its right to →50 pounds (1.400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his post as the leader of opposition of the subhouse in September after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said that members of the Parliament would live "with a magnifying R".
"It means essentially if you have to live for the State and to be treated with S*****e."
He said, "I've spent my money for my garden, and I've raised a claim on a small part of the things that belong.
And I could have required all the fucking amount, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a billion of his former kare as oilmakers, was first attacked in May because of his debts, as it was clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he claimed to the fees Office that this " could be considered as overwhelmed demand".
A activist, a protestant in Dudán Rasen, buried a loch in form of a pound mark after it became a request for over three years for 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
When he was questioned last night about the elevated hypothek, Duncan said, "This was both by the fees Office and the following by legend to value increase."
He still adds: "There is no debate on the exhaust and transparency or the procedure of rules or similarity.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and all.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."

"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four weeks and the same program," Mr Chatel has approved.
For the Minister, "they must be overcome this clearness, because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and entirely a concurrence of "the best students".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientist," he continued: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been concerned about the missing historical-geographic education in the terminals on technical Lyceans."
On Saturday, an IFOP investigation in humanity critised that nearly seven of Francesen (69%) the public project of binding education in history and geography in the terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile).
However, the Minister replied that there was no question about the restriction of the Philosophes of the Terminals S.

▪ they conduct practices during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He continued: "If you add all practices offered before the performance check, you will have more hours that you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister explained that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "this thing which does not exist in the education.
He reiterated that he wanted to remove the school card "to 2012".
15 minutes for climate at the "Normal Superior School"
Five minutes to talk about the use on the copper of Copenhagen: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supreme in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist of the AFP, the peace nobel pricemaker Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conferences, at which experts return to the public every five minutes with filmed contributions.
Something you want to do to achieve and wake the feeling of people in them to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the border of the conference. The name of this event returns to the name that the students gave the fish in the school base.
"Beside the experts were chosen about the twenty participants, even after their charism," he explains.
"To climate heat, you can speak for hours, but the nuclear goals can be drawn in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel of the AFP said, "which only spoke freely before approximately 50 people.
"This is a part of our role as a socialist," he stressed in the hope that the auditors can accept that "the Conference of Copenhagen is able to go to a absolutely serious scientific document."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be found online on the school page since December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and then will be located every two months.
Payment expenditure : worrying prison guards, planned action
On Friday, the offices of criminal officers invited a general action day to demonstrate that the premies and surroundings which were revoked from the budget were transferred to January before Christmas Festivals.
The second work of the criminal officers ("FO-penitentiary") requested the employees who have no service to demonstrate tomorrow before the penalty office and block them in order to notify the "Deep Steel of what they are allowed" on Saturday.
The third work of the criminal officers ("CGT-penitentiary") urged to "unify himself to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", which would be burned as "sensitive and inacceptable" by the non-payment of the overtimes, night adjudications and sunday events in December.
The first activity of criminal officers, the UFAP/UNSA's autonomous criminal union, called to "general mobilisations... to show insatisfaction and anger".
The Government of the Criminal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtimes were strongly increased in 2009, not all in the budget, but guaranteed that the remaining requests were paid in January.

Euro-2009/Scorch Travel: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
The French Friderik Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the Swimming World Masterships 2009, received a international title on Tuesday on its favorite distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 short-way in Istanbul.
On the first day of this wet fight, at the last time the polyuretanans were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and both others by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the masters.
Damage for Bousquet, who wanted to take a 50-m free style, his record is holding in a large beck (20.94).
At one of the two royal distants in the swimming, 50m freestyle, 28-year French stated in 20,53 seconds, at a final end with ↓ swimmers at the beginning (usually eight) - a premium at international level.
Bousquet wined the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not break the well-treeword (20.30) as planned.
"You can always believe greater, and in the preceding case I said, if the good news is in my kingdom, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all weapons started in polyurethanans that have been prohibited since 1 January 2010.
With 238 welcoming orders since February 2008, this combine ends their epos in Istanbul, which began 1999 in the same legal fight.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Bifeldmann, two-fold world master in the beach this summer in Rome and Weltrekord, at the end.
The young swimmer did not improve his best time over 400 meters of free style (3:32.77), but he performed with the second time in his car (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glasner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a good word today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious enemy in the future," said Bi-mann.

A Roman grave disc, calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million dollars over its value, so the artist Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century to Christ and has always been evaluated with 150,000 to 250,000.
The marmor on which "four scenes of Dionysos in a sophistical architectural decoration, surrounded by satyren and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the increase in Roman and Egypt Antiquities at Sothebys, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was cut in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is safely what the buyers have offered until now," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marmor part through Emile Zola is far back.
The plate was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous assembly of the Borghese family at home, and then it was a piece of part in the French shower C.I., which was used in her bathroom of her Pariser hotel and in Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshall Pétain came to the power.
The next fifty years are in darkness.
During the review of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this platform was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérese Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquarat".
Zelayas has been interrupted from Honduras direction Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico had not yet agreed with the conditions for the transfer of the corrupted Hondoran president Manuel Zelaya to the home ground after this trial had rejected the Putsch government as inacceptable.
After a telephone conversation that was found at night with President Zelaya, it seems to be aware of the possibility of implementing this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the imigration staff, the aircraft sent by the Government of Mexican, which was found in Salvador for the purpose of the transfer of Mr Zelayas in the middle of the midweek, was returned.
The Putsch Government wanted Mr. Zelaya to "release" and to ask for a political asylum for him in the foreign country.
However, the disrupted president refused this because he wanted to return to Mexico as the best official leader.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed misfortune by trying to move me to my expenses..., they wanted me to thank," Mr. Zelaya said on Thursday against Radio Globo, in which he has been reporting often since the political crisis, which has been stopped in the Mediterranean country for five months.
I can stay here well and pleased for years, here I have my gitarre, f'e'e'e the corrupted president, who had added to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa for two and half months ago, under the attacks of some agreements.
The Mexican message has presented us a request for a course that we cannot accept, however, because it has not included a request for asylum, as Oscar Raul Matute, the Internal Minister of the Putsch Government, had explained against the Hungarian Radio HRN at the middle-week.
I seek no land for asyl, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the telesur channel whose seat was in Caracas.
A possible outcome from Honduras, which he had underlined, would only be the president of the Honduras people.
In the middle of the mid-week, the aircraft of Mr. Zelayas had mobilized the attachments of the broken president who had opened up to the Brazilian message and gathered around it, while the soldier had strengthened his use.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putch Government.
This, as its appreciation, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who was approached to the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was addressed on 28 June, on the day of its organized people's preparation for his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Army and the Congress.
From Exil in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on September 21, and he had lighted into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested because of the high-contracts which he is accused of justice, as the Putsch Government.
Roberto Micheletti has been able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to resolve Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the conflicted election, however, rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress voted massively against Mr Zelayas Back to office until its mandate was expired on 27 January.

The trade depth of the United States was decreased by 7.6% at 32.9 billion in October.

Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing on the potential exhibit "Ladies in Wiss"
Some hundreds of people in Cuban's power, on Thursday, have spent the women gathered in Havanna for the purpose of the world's human rights, and have also made a different promotion, for which a duty of dissidents has been temporarily arrested.
About the fourteen "Ladies in Wiss", wives or neighbors of the police prisoners, were spent on open streets of the government partys under Raul Castro, just as they were on the Fusmarish center of the capital to request the freedom of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP acted.
Down with the Yankies!, "Soldner!", "the street belongs to the revolutionary!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", his strong parties scandled the dissidents with a high fashion.
Lastly, civilians were iskorted to "their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Wiss" had been played in Havanna last night, where it wasn't coming to hurt or arrest.
On the contrary, in the Hawaiian city part of Vedado, a thousand dissidents, who were also invoked to the demonstration found on Thursday in front of the International Human Rights Act, were temporarily arrested by civil policies, a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents exposed by the Government party to increase in civil vehicles.
The transitional arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited only to a few hours.
As advocates on the prices provided by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" have an unapproval surprise for the "Bitting for the release of all political prisoners", whose number of dissidents show about 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a 20-year prison penalty.
Mr. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which 53 are sitting behind the grids.
The Cuban authorities felt the enemies of the regime as "söldner" or "agents" in the service of the stated enemy, the United States.
A ratio is that the Cuban TV replaced the report on the demonstration events found on Thursday between military pro-government campaigns and the "contro-revolutionary" report.
The part of a single party, the Communist Party, Cuba, is regularly accused of the lifting of rights and freedoms of opinion or of the NROs.
Wohnshore kills 80 years with the chest and leaves 5 vulnerable in Clichy-la-garenne
A weapons-armad householder killed an eighty-year-year-old and five other persons in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne.
With the first information of the question, the 28-year-old rider had hurt the eighty-year-olds in or before an apothec on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures Boulevard with two measurements and this, accordingly, police data, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has taken the consequences of his damage, according to a responsibility of the Police Syndicat Alliance in the hospital.
In or before the same apotheke, he got a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, quickly in the triggers, has been arrested and wounded.
The first two victims were severely injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other damage is weakened in life, since he, according to police sources, has apparently been affected by living organs.
The pregnant woman has become bad because of the events and has to be hospitalized by a policeman according to the "shock state".
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or employment, must be on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two other passengers, apparently randomly: a three-year-old and a forty-year-old, and the last of the two is difficult.
The scenario stayed in darkness at night.
He was weaponsed with two meat measurers, which he was crossed behind his back, explained in front of Arnaud Presse, a responsible for the Syndicat Alliance of the region Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passengers, including youths, have been attempted to cover the dishes, according to the testimony reports made by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the triggers with a green west.
Three youths try to invoke.
They didn't get it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a Cellner of a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, including a city policeman who has broken the handheld.
On the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two citizens, including their representative, have tried to hold the armed man arrested and have been harmful with so-called police information.
The event has been played in one of the main rates of Clichy-la-garenne, where there is a number of businesses.
Patents arrived on me to tell me that there is a hurt person.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them into the first-help station and noticed a flaming wound in the magic area, declared Fredeone Allione, a 35-year-old apotheker, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, approximately three-year-old person arrived by interrupting wounds.
The police's forces have, of course, adopted the man who had no exhibition papers.
The State Advocate of Nanterre has commissioned the Criminal Policeivos Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92).
The householder has been hospitalized at Thursday.
In view of his state, he has not yet been judged.
A policeman doesn't exclude that he is entered into a nervous healing.
With a other police source, six police officers were forced to join him at the police committee in Clichy, where he was carried out.
He was "in a state of overcome" as "all spiritual confusioners of this kind, in which the powers are released during the tattership".
U.S.: Polish lawyer requires the replacement of the criminal persecution
The lawyer of the French-Polonian filmmaker Roman Polanski requested for the repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to leave the penalties against his man, who is currently in the residence of Switzerland due to a seat of more than 30 years ago before the court.
Chad Hummel, a legal lawyer of the "Pianist" leader, in the second district of California, has committed a cruel process in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Procedure in the second district of California.
I call on the State of Penalty, Mr Hummel explained before he added that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband on the time of the negotiation with the case "is a cold running backs down."
He, in the meantime, had discussed with a state lawyer who had told him that Roman Polanski had deserved Zuchhous, which represented a grave process of mistakes.
This discussion was opened in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired) in particular by the candidate State lawyer David Wells.
Mr. Wells had definitely explained the end of September that the authors of the documentary film had "lied".
If the Court of Justice refused to set up the penalty procedure, Mr Hummel would require the conduct of a process that would enable him to present the evidence of his argumentation.
The complaint repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a debate on the cancellation of the facts imposed on the charge may not be seriously taken into consideration until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old ruler was from the United States in 1978, even before the penalty was announced for " illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since this time, he hasn't been traveling to the United States.
Phyllis Asayama, the representative of the state of Los Angeles County, said that Roman Polanski must be "in order to attend the negotiation".
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other complaints, which is a possibility of escape?, Mrs Asayma asks.
Your opinion, after "the moviemaker asks the court for a pleasure and disobeys his authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to give their decision – even highlighted that there are other flight alternatives.
Hummel was not the only one who had asked the position of criminal persecution against Roman Polanski.
Moreover, the advocate of Samantha Geimer, the victim, requested the cancellation of the penalty procedure.
She recalled that her client would no longer feel that it would be disappointed by every renewal of the case Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the admission of a prison command.
After he spent two months behind the grids, he was then condemned in expectation of a possible delivery to the home arrest in Chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is burned by the growth of the scene and shut off without a course.
The New York Börse stopped on Friday without a course, in a market that was reduced between better indicators than the United States and an increase in the growth: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final numbers for closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was added to 65.67 points on 10.471,50 points while the Nasdaq dominated 0.55 points on 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor 500 is increased by 0.37 % (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
"Really, the market is pretty safe," said the Mace lock silver of Marblehead Asset management.
"He remains very limited, the trade volume has become very low, and I think that this will remain until the end of the year."
The tendence was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected to "become to improve the market view of the re-economic re-reduction", the analysers of Charles Schwab together.
In the United States, the sales in the single trade in November increased by 1.3%, thus two months behind and much more than expected.
Moreover, the confidence of the consumers has been clearly improved in December, and even on,4 against 67.4 in the previous month, as indicated in the Index of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexs have been born by a new increase in the rate which has reached the maximum state of the euro for two months, thus 'the attempt sectors for the economic situation below', stated Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank.
The ambiguous values have lost something on the ground.
The obligation has gone back.
The rent of the tax liabilities exceeding 10 years was 3.540 % at midnight at 3.482 % and the loans exceeded 30 years to 4.497 % to 4.492 % of the earlier.

I'm wrong with people whom I'm probably never able to approach.
I'll be back to the World Mastership in 2010, pleased by Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday are according to Son David "very positive"
The news of Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who lived there for a few days in the hospital.
The news are very positive.
He is very strong, it works very well, explained David Hallyday of the press on exit from the aircraft when he arrived shortly after 13 hours of local time (21 hours MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the song, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "shotest" in the hospital of Cedars-Sinai, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday because of a bacterian infection after a operation in a bandy accident in Paris on 26 November.
The song was placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to reduce his strong pain and be able to carry out his treatment, the press service was given.
Johnny Hallyday was replaced by the doctors of the hospital Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles into an artistic coma in which he was delivered on Monday because of a bacteriaal follow-up after a band-shirt operation in Paris on 26 November.
The song had to react to a operation on the night from midnight to Thursday, due to the painful changes that had occurred by the latest intervention.
His wife Laeticia shared on Friday morning in a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photograph of the AFP.
The Chief of the Ortopædic and Traumatological Surgery Division at the Hopital Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, said that he would visit the song in the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The product severely charged the neurochirurg Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the song on 26 November in the Clinique International du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were explained that he created the cleanest massacher.
The chirurgs of Los Angeles said that they were completely disappointed, said Mr Camus.
I have heard that a judicial procedure might be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "is too quick and this has been traveled with the permission of the Paris chirurgic chirurgical to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned with this Ar, who assured me that he viewed these travels as a completely unproblematic, which had really surprised me, because I have already had two band-sheet operations behind me, he's going to add.
Shortly before, he said that the song seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very in artificial environment.
He had operated Marie Trintigant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, in which he practiced at this time.
2007 he also operated the sheriff Charlotte Gainsbourg to resurrect a hematome after a brain bleeding.
However, it is also an arc with a doubtful call, which has been condemned several times because of misled operations and not to be forgotten because of tax recovery and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a legal lawyer of the doctor's room, has made him "a man without scrupel" who has "regularly" to be responsible for the chamber and "all other than recommended".
After a few days of the swimming, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a report on Friday over his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "not called blooding and therefore needs no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been exercised since last summer, appears to be questioned.
It is clearly clear that it is too short for a continuation of the tournee on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Association (Union for the French Democracy) will be energy and calls on the Partie New Centres to no longer use its victory.
The party covenant monitored by François Bayrou's Partii MoDem on Friday, on a trial of receipt of the sign, which, on the basis of a party founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the president of the Party New Centre, Hervé Morin, was urgently reacted and invited him to use this victory on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF signal, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worth defending this political inheritance after he had reached the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this meeting on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In view of his efforts, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, now in the NC), which has made a claim to the ownership of the UDF mark, since he first requested this mark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrial".
However, the business office of the UDF party covenant watched by François Bayrous' friends, which gave clear understanding that they were not allowed to dismiss and put the Minister and the lawyer under the threat of a judicial persecution a period of time to no longer use this victory and to overcome their own rights of the mark.
In the last days, you have made a number of statements that you would propose your political movement, the UDF sign to +taking+, the party agreement wrote in a writing of 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Partie MoDem, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the central covenant.
They also believed that you had the right to put the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogans + the modern UDF +, on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this signal, the UDF's business office explained and invites the Partie NC to "remove the name UDF from all materials and (her) websites".
○ Hervé de Charette was requested to oversee the rights of the mark to their legal accusations.
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to give respect to the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the underlyers will warn.
In their letters, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a complete political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends have "communicated the election" to leave this 2007 to create a competitive movement, as had done otherwise in 2002, to establish the party "UMP".
The Partie New Centre therefore has no rights to use the underlying UDF-seegel (Union for la democracy French).
They continue to remember that the last UDF Congress of 2007 has decreased the three-year approach to the MODem Party and the establishment of a business body to defense "the material and moral interests" of the movement based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the business office continues, "what he was on the time he requested the name of the mark has not been member of the UDF since three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and disgusting way, from the failure of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this invisibleness is the best way to turn into a criminal, and ironise the CN's intentions: "There is, however, that we appear in the life and that we would be more able to make yourself a name instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by adheriting a name in a disgraceful way on which no legal applications are available."
Affairs Liliane bedscourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for use of weaknesses
The judge of Nanterre decided on Friday to evaluate the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the Milliarden Liliane bedcourt claimed, he used a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to reach a part of its power.
The 62-year-old photograph, which is for his starfotos, must be responsible for the use of weaknesses before the court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a criminal offence which is committed with a maximum of three years of freedom and a money penalty of EUR 375.000.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this matter which the Saga is worthy of one of the richest familys of France, where mother and daughter are filled and at the same time have the moves of the Cosmetickerium L'Oreal.
However, the 15th penalty room also ordered a medical investigation of the 87-year-old Liliane bedcourt, which is conducted together by three doctors.
The Herbine and Main Actionary of L'Oreal has yet refused to undertake such an investigation, in particular not among the conditions under which the State official law has been investigated.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 that clearly gives you whether and at what time Liliane bedcourt could have been found in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undertake these investigations.
I will talk to her, after the negotiation, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kieman.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an outstanding news.... The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which he has to be confirmed.
Since two years, the only daughter of Liliane bedtencourt has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and allround artists and has accused him of having used their mother's weakness for a year in order to obtain provisions of a billion euros in form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane bedcourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographs that she sees as a long-year friend.
Although the Court had to examine the validity of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family degree on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called three letters sent by his client to her note (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she was disgusting the husband of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to his lawyer, Liliane bedcourt adds: "Please declare my daughter that I have written to the Banier for five years, one to two times daily.
I've never been able to speak since their marriage."
The State Advocate of Nanterre again believes that the complainant had no right to respond so, especially because a prosecutor has rejected its request in the last days to introduce a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane bedscourt "is completely legal, is not under protection and has no prejudice.
No one has the right to act at its place," confirmed the representative of the State Advocate, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give a sentence after the process of authorisation of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager-revolution or the end of early clothes?
If nothing changes the lead of the large French company, our fight for the development of economic intellectuals has been elsewhere ...
Since over a year, the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis of consumers before the marketing revolution said that the staff 'value' determines the best as it was to refer to the consumer product of the technicians in the work.
By giving customers the marketing revolution to the company in the centre, the marketing revolution has given the market upgrading in place ... although the authoritary trial is to re-reduce customers' preferences regularly!
Demobilization of workers can lead to demoralization.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much greater phenomenon that affects the employees.
This demobilization affects negatively the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of the F&Eund, which is still more determined, to those of the economic intellectual.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economy = Economic Intelligence) "of all participated parties... requests a proactive action and a future oriented view"; it recommends the employees a use that is completely responsible for the authoritary management's instructions.
That is why we call for a practical revolution that would be in place to set the employees equally at the medium point of the company's claims besides the customers.
The very relevant benefits of internal opinions
Will the internal opinion issues, such as the questionbook, which Orange has submitted to his recipients, be addressed to this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately.
- Tone, because I could find that all the addictions in the face of a new situation in many ways are at the priority of doing this... what it's always done.
It is also because the authorism - one of the pathology of power- proportional to the importance of his own misfortune.
And because most of the leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behaviour.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt the old behaviorist theory that recently was reactivated by the American Neurological Sciences and was uncertainly broadcast by research institutions and the media.
As a result, and by suggesting that it is possible to confirm the "hebel" (sic) commitment of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr investigation of Ipsos strengthens the leading forces in a position to a mechanistic control system which is unnecessary for the world today.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a practical revolution that is necessary for the useless function of modern enterprises provides the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol in any consideration or practice of control: the commitment for the recipients is only possible if it seems clearly a means to perform a part of their dreams, their honor and their preservations.
At the moment, the multifunctional analysis only takes this concept of the motivation of the workers.
These have shown that they evaluate their companies on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to evaluate what it offers to achieve their lives' objectives.
Thanks to the Implementation and measurement of these mobilization factors, the leading forces of the companies can control, predict and prevent their human resource management, and restore their human resource management at the right place.
Thus they create a fruitful ground that is beneficial for the development of a strong and efficient economic intellectual.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama Lob from the right
The Ananian rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday and was satisfied that the 2009 peacenobel price defended the term of the "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had deployed the price allocation to Obama on 9 October applauded this time the Chairman's speech, the example of the former vice-Presidency candidate in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
What he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wings of the Republican Party in the United States Day magazine, and added that she himself brought the subject of a "timely necessary" war in their own memory published.
The war is, of course, the last one I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who had two wars of former George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justifie the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to declare his decisions nine days ago to send 300,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another enemy of Obama, Newt Gingrich, rejected the opinion that the president had done "very work" in Oslo.
I felt that the talk was very good, and the former president of the House of Representative, which, in particular, recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this talk was completely historical, Ginrich, who was questioned in the "The Takeaway" radio sending.
The lawyer, which was considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the election of the presidency of 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "no free and could not extinguish a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, the former writer of George W. Bush and the medium-time editor at the Washington Post, Obama held "a very ananical talk".
In addition, he is "cosmopolit" as "he always does it", "that he has spoken as an Ananian president", when he pointed out that the Europeans live "as in a security blaz that they have not created themselves and not doing much for their protection", as Gerson.
Among the small, unconvinced rights, the former UN bootscape John Bolton, a fall of Era Bush, spoke on the National Review Online website as "languous, high and inspirative".
On the left hand of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is deployed about how Barack Obama defends the backing to the fighting forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the mass can just be justified to the innocents, he warns.
However, the pressure of the right-handed links remains praising on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Price was forgiven to Obama, covered itself for a speaker like him who is for his talent, as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo " offers a final plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and pressure", as well as the Californian Daily Journal.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and covered his speech as "dust and examplely simultaneously".
FAQ: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the branches of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employee organisation that remained until the end - on a Friday-day agreement, which ended to Christmas' order and threatening severity pass.
At the signature meeting on Friday, the State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, "congratulated with the agreement which was initiated on midnight after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second negotiating night, the negotiators separated the early Friday morning in the hope of submitting the agreement quickly on the latest morning.
The three worker associates (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) have also left the meeting.
However, there were more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 to the end of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was subjected.
The conflict "he had caused the company very much damage" and "he was to preserve that he would affect the feast at the end of the year," as bussereau.
The Agreement provides an increase in payment by 4% for the lowest loans (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the maximum loan groups (international transport).
The hour rates for employees with the lowest wages are therefore increased from EUR 8,72 to EUR 9,06.
"It's not very much, but we're just starting small at," so Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists will now be assigned to no longer block the supplies.
"But there will always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The President of TLF Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficulty to purchase these wage increases in front of the international competition".
It suggests that the increase of 170 euros per month is for the lowest and 100 to 120 euros for the high salary groups.
"This agreement is based on the healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," such as Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed the "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the increase in travels by 3 % and the maintenance of the total Road Transport Country in the first half year 2010, which will, in particular, be enabled to address the 13th monthly content and the modernisation of tariff contracts.
Mr Bussereau noted that "the sink of taxes for employees for 100 million euros" was an object of an amendment from the Government to the draft law for 2009, which was decreased by the National Assembly on Thursday's night to Friday.
The Government calls for "equivalent" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply to the companies associated with that organisation and then to apply in the case of an extension by the Minister for the entire profession.
This will be "in the latest time" of the case, assured busereau.
The opposition of workers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR binding introduced a "building trade" because the 100 million euros were already charged to the sector to compensate a part of the carbon taxes.
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not on the basis of a total eating at the next Christmas, Unostra regrets.
For the Federation of Otre, the agreement "the small and medium-sized companies of the branch in the coming 12 months" threatens a great grave.
Line RER A: Incompatible with the proposals of the RATP
The sights on the RER A line, the largest shipping network in France for the Great Space of Paris and the île-de-France continued on weekend while a meeting on Friday, the 2th strike day between the companys and the leading of the RATP (individual Parisian persons' transport administration), continued to wait on their requests for payments.
At this important purchasing week before Christmas, no moves were taken between 10:00 and 20:00. On the center (in the middle of La Defense and Nation) only one of two moves and outside the center string was used to use only one of the four moves.
The connection to the SNCF moves was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the travelers to increase.
The purchased Gallery Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business wrong-technically".
Line RER A translates the Paris Payment Room from Western to East.
The segment of the RATP connects the places Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre and Boissy-Saint-Location and Marne-La-Valleée.
On Friday, about one of two moves planned to the main time of traffic, and almost no one during the poor traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the roads, since the people of the Ile-de-France had set up the situation.
As early on the morning, the trainhof of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less passed than other, especially because of the lack of Gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, Engineer (29), would have been raised "a half hours ago to get to work."
The SNCF, who had planned to maintain the travellers by employees and order forces, pointed out that it had not come to any engagement in the travelhof of Saint-Lazare.
The moves running by the SNCF on the RER A line or in direction of Cergy-Le-Huut arrived or went through the St. Lazare train to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main assemblies of the strikeholders were replaced, while the results were reviewed, which the associations after the meeting with the leader's hospitals were considered as "necessary" on Friday afternoon.
The RER Business Leader proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A on all relevant aspects, worktimes, professional courses, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South) they ask for a longer random payment.
The CGT was emphasised that the RATP himself puts its salary proposals in clammers and emphasised that the carrier is not able to solve a problem while it was possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP cleared that a new meeting was proposed for "complete examination of work conditions" for Monday.
This also shows to the associations that the company "ignorates the weekend driver".
On the morning, approximately 150 carriers are seeking to release a committee in Paris.
Re-repeat, it was the driving box that until the date had refused any discussion during the streek, and a meeting was closed after a delay of the situation.
On Wednesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after an announcement of Unsa and independent.
The associations call for a payment of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Indipendants), and also complain about the deterioration of work conditions in this area, which are on the road of millions daily.
The drivers of the RER Line, which are available for a year-time profession, shall include a breakfast of 2.200 to 2.700 euros and a payment of 600 to 650 euros for shipping services, as well as the sun and celebration.
Turkey Constitutional Court L° Pro-kurdic Party. decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court gave the resolution of the Pro-Kurdic Major Party of the country; a decision followed the immediate democracy demonstration in the Kurdish Community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the Government's work to make it very difficult to make the Kurdish Community in order to end the conflicts since 25 years.
The "partie for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been resolved since it has become a "place for A's places that are negative to the independence of the State and its unipartial unity", as the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would be taken by 11 judges, whereas a majority of seven votes would have been necessary to deal with the resolution, and he also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the Party, including the President Ahmet Turkey and the Parliament Aysel Tugluc, were excluded from political events for five years.
Moreover, the judge announced the derogation of the parliamentary immunity, Turkey and Tugluc, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP has now over 21 places in Parliament (from 550).
The Participants said before the sentence that Parliament would prefer to leave Parliament than to take parts of Parliament.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the Advocate of the Turkish Federal Federation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, accused the DTP to follow the "instructions" of the Kurdist Party (PKK) which Ankara and many other countries are considered as terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political creation window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures the "no connection" to the PKK, refusing to deal with it as a terrorist organisation and calling upon the Government to negotiate.
The sentence of the Constitutional Court functions, inter alia, that is intended to meet the Kurdish Community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to ensure the support of the PKK through the curds and to end the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a rebuilding of spending in Southeast Anatoly, where many demonstrations against the prison conditions of the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to compatibilities with the police during last weeks.
Since the Court's announcement, thousands of demonstrants have been gathered before the DTP spaces in the city of million Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mostly populated by Kurden.
The order forces introduced tree gas granates and water washers when the demonstrants began to throw molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the sentence, Turkey concluded that the decision of the Court of Justice "the deterioration continues".
"Turkey cannot clothe this (kurdish, announcement) question based on the prohibition of a party," he explained the press.
The Government, consisting of a party resulting from islamic movement, also suffered the decision.
"We're opposing Prince against the closing of the parties.
This is not the problem," so the Minister for Energy Tanner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torture of the democratic opening promoted by the Government," as the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously react to a reaction of the PKK asth," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK came to an attack in which seven soldiers in the north of Turkey were killed at three days ago, which was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
Snow break can come
A fair winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not as soon as he wants to dispute the citizens, the leader of the Winter Services of the FES says.
Specially so that his workers can test and control the entire vehicle technology.
At the end of the week, it might be the first time that the meteorologists would be so far.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to care for snow and iron.
This is what the FES is going on in accordance with a precise plan.
As soon as it snippets in Frankfurt, and the temperatures below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-streams will be driven with big vehicles, states Brauburger.
This includes main roads and roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Paths.
But also fire carriers, OPAV routes, foot walking zones and streets with appeals such as the atzelberg roads.
The FES's service starts at three hours in the morning
The approximately 1040 km should be stretched in a maximum of three hours with smooth salt that is better holding.
Therefore, the FES starts at three hours night, "which the streams are free until the professional traffic begins".
It'll be difficult if it's just cutting at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service leader, "for then no one is ready to make the stream vehicle space."
First of all, if it is not further cut off, the delivery and exemption roads, which also belong to the Pacific Paths, are in the range.
The last priority has side and side streets.
There will be complaints, Brauburger.
At five hours of the morning the FES football is on the road, the points and transitions are priorityly released.
The FES is mostly not able to care for all roadways.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that holds the bridges in the eye, says Brauburger.
Since it is given on this quick glass, the temperature is soon as the temperature falls under two degrees, the streamer is on the road.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The wheel of the dinosauriers
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-freeding dinosauriers: The two meters long and 1,50 meters large animal was running on two powerful backboys, had a long shadow with scarlets, bound teeth, short arms with sykel cracks and a long sweet.
If the species had spent a few million years later, it would be nothing.
However, Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosauriers with these body characters, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the face of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurians, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relativeness, the spread and the characteristics of the former dinosaurians.
2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to bury on the Ghost Ranch in the North New Mexico.
Sometimes on one day, we found a dozen of dinosaurier bones, which is not for example for the trials, reports Team-Mitglied Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones identified the researchers quickly as a new type.
During the excavation, they gathered the rest of five individuals.
Fund occupied theories about dino stories
The name "Tawa" comes from the God of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an extraordinary fund: "Dinosau-fossilies from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly only single breaks are found."
Other dinosaurier experts do not share the enthusiasm absolutely.
Beyond speculate this fund is not, but he visits some theories about the early history of the dinosaurians, says about Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosauriers first rose about 230 million years ago.
However, the oldest fossils are incomplete, why the adjustment of these ur-dinos is most contrary.
The experts, for example, discuss how the exes were divided into their three main development lines: the meat terapeuticals, which later the King Tyronosaurus, the Velociraptor and the birds included as "Largeness" four bones saropods and their relatives, and the pigs eating ornithischia (peak beach sauriers), for example, the species of triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is a original therapy.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the shadow of Tawa hallae, the researchers found indications on air sacks, such as the followers of the therapy, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacks, the breathing of birds is more than the sugars.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the wheel column also appeared partly with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive therapy with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of large sauropodes later had also air shoes and light building bones, the common preference of both groups had probably produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration sources to North America
Since the most primitive dinosauriers lived in South America, researchers follow that the husbands appeared there first.
Thus, the three development lines had been separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at the same time, as supercontinent Panghai, were a single landmass.
That is why the fact that the team with Tawa hallae the rest of two other, not particularly relative therapy.
The three are not able to decline from a common, immigrant precept, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration walls to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a companion of the science study.
It is freely too the opposite.
A more older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of dinosaurians, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paläontolog Martin Sander.
See opinion might be a corrupt image because in South America there are simply many primitive dino fossiles left, while there is rarely something to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurians have developed from a relatively rare sideline of the Reptilian tribe to the governing farmers of the earthly age, it is still disturbing.
In the currency of the Tria, the dinosauriers shared their live room with many other reptilies, such as the predecessors of today’s crocodile and flight sauriers and with numerous other eases.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosauriers spread up throughout the world and developed many new species, while the family at the border of the Trias to the Jura disappeared.
History wasn't forever successful
There are two hypotheses to declare this exchange, says Martin Sander.
It could have given a massive death that the dinosaurians had survived accidentally, but the other reptiles were not.
Or the dinosauriers were better adapted so they could kill the competition from the field.
The history of success was no longer forever.
150 million years later, a meteoretical incidence of a group of animals to flow, which has also developed in the Trias, and since then a shadow is a period of time: the kidney.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long, and the underlyers are international.
Professors of Toronto are on the face of Cambri, the Uni Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
They are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police room of the occupied casinos of the Frankfurt Goethe University brings whales worldwide.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from high schools throughout Germany, Europe and South America, are solidarized with the protesting students at the West Campus.
In a German and English replaced statement "deficiencies" they are the police of the president.
The University President Werner Mämer-Estler had allowed the buildings occupied by students and dogues in the educational course in the past week, because walls and artworks were contaminated.
Five students were hurt.
The case damage, judged by the subsequents, did not justifie "the violent resolution of self-subsequent teaching events of students and teachers through a police order".
The space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The outstretched focus on vandalism is "the delegation and criminalisation of the protest" and the contents.
The Presidency has reached the necessary discussion.
The Doeen requires the immediate position of criminal persecution.
The majority of the Electors have not supported the damage of the business, it is said.
Protest legitimate
In addition, youths of the University Verdi and the German Training Bound are solidarised with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern about its own future, says Verdi-Land Young Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Ministry, Eva Küne-Hörmann (CDU), defended the action of the Uni-President and the police.
We're thankful to the UN-President.
Increasing and occupation are completely unacceptable funds, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wesbaden Landing Day.
We have understanding for the protest, but not understanding for vandalism, so the CDU country deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the SPD, Green and Left Opposition Fractions saw that.
The CDU takes shaded walls for the prevention to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Li日).
Instead of putting out the arguments and demands of the individuals, we have been released.
The Left has introduced a request that invites the Minister to report the police action.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, she felt inappropriate as a secret city, for west-western farmers.
Selenograd, one of the districts of Moscow's capital, was a strictly guardian place in the Soviet Union for a secret survey.
Today, the community is used with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nano-electronics are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Selenograd have linked contacts to the place of France for Riedberg, with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt innovationsrum (FIZ).
There were several mutual searches, and in the middle of the mid-week, Selenograd and Riedberg were now signed in Frankfurt a "protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vize citizen Master Juri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Sōnov of Selenograd led to the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt planning dezernant Edwin Schwarz.
2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural scientific focal force for a seminar to Selenograd.
Social exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companys of the FIZ will be allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
In the area, Russian Community forms would like to find contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of most important Russian research institutions and undertakings.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large Conzerne Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Electronica.
The community was founded in 1958 as so-called "socialist planstadt" for the destruction research.
Selenograd (formally translated "Greünstadt") received his name from the managed hill country in which the research institutions were incorporated.
Stuttgarter Bremsclotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 can't be used enough.
For the project's demands, it's just "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the depth of a bathroomhof, more than a monstrous building town that will be destroyed by the town of the bathroom-württemberg town for a year in a healthy building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 has occurred from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headways with glasses that ended in the middle of the city at that time felt the wrong-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted as a breaming block of a modern shining traffic, since it had to take a lot of time to stretch locomotives from behind to forward.
Come in, keep quickly, continue walking - that's what's going on.
That is why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and München.
And in Stuttgart: a travelhouse, which is about half of the trans-sheet magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the Slogan from the "Herz of Europe".
S21 is actually being done, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and the Bayer Great town to implement the depth.
Headways, however, have no more input and export problem since there are modern trains with train vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 nest of the ICE-new street to Ulm is now going.
National and Communal Policies have implemented it.
The road also involves because the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of tax payers and not of the national counterparts.
The urban building can be justified in some ways.
There is a new city room that - you believe the computer generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is damaged for the divergence system.
The travel head and the trailing building are considered to be the person's traffic, which - typically 80 years - was a major growth.
There was no competition on that time.
However, it must be first to strengthen the goods transport, since transport on the skies is significantly more environmental than per Lkw on the road.
However, the rebuilding lines are not for good trains because of a fair crossing.
More severe is that S21 indirectly touches many other train projects.
Good six billion euros are to be prohibited in the Swedish.
This is the official number.
Experts hold up to 15 billion for realistics.
It states that the next year the money will be missed at other node points and shipments on the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Deliverance.
One of the most important is the extent of about 180 km long streams through the raintal.
Since 1987, the road has been built in the timely time.
It would be urgent to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will be acting as a bremshot.
The raintal line will be a flashhouse for international trade in goods: in the middle of the heart of Europe.
Government examines the Court of Airport
The Government has opened the country in the Wesbaden Landday whether it will be in a review against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court of Justice (VGH).
The CDU/FDP coalition has ordered experts to allow over 400 pages to check the total VGH jurisdiction legally, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Cassel was writtenly based on that day that the country should re-regularize the night flight prohibition in the case of the Northwest landscape planned in Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as it is expected by the Government of the country, should not agree with the legally proposed protection of the population from nightly aircraft.
The coalition must decide whether it is in revision until 4 January.
The opposite criticized this exhibition and urged the representatives of the Government to submit to a revision at the Federal Administration Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chairman Torsten Shipper Gumbel requested CDU and FDP to restore their promises to a night flight prohibition. Otherwise, this is to be considered as "wordbrush".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, the Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said to the FDP election log "We keep the word".
Minister Posch revealed the proposal of Chefer-Gumbel, attempting the Government of the country to come to their night flights with "the rights and trick-serie".
A precise legal examination needs their time.
The coalition doesn't want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure division, said Stefan Mıer (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group have never been for the night flight prohibition.
US banks return help
The cross-coated US gross banks disappear their state fees.
The Bank of America returned the aid from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp to a total of 45 billion euros (by 30 billion euros).
The citigroup also plans, according to a report of the US sender CNBC, to restore State aid.
The institutions want to deal with the restrictions imposed by the adoption of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of Managerboni and higher taxes.
The Bank of America had been able to provide 19 billion free money in investors.
The sum of the sum took it from its own box, which, among other things, was well sold by sparten sales.
The Bank Chairman Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the middle-weeking tax payers: the money price has helped over a very difficult time.
The cashhouse was decreased at the level of the financial crisis with the receipt of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The citigroup also wants to gain money in capital to be free from its commitments to the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce about 20 billion more seriously exciting its capital, reported CNBC by calling on circles.
A citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid their help.
Quick Choice
Then everything went faster than you thought.
If two weeks after the ZDF Management Board had driven the official Chef Nikolaus Brander from the office, the sender can present a follower.
Last night, the body wanted to vote over the staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, leader of the ZDF Highstadt Study in Berlin.
However, an operation was not - officially - in order to not implement the procedure.
However, it should have also played a role to avoid further protecting the ZDF Intens Markus Schacher, nor should this proposal be taken to the Governing Board.
Freey, the Chief Kandidat, needs the support of nine of the 14 Gremium members.
The result of the vote was not still fixed in the end of this report.
Two weeks ago, a proposal for the prolongation of the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender was failed in the Governing Board.
Only seven members talked to burners, seven voted against him. Brander's choice was a lower delay for shocks, a expectable.
Because the majority of the Union in the Governing Board has already signed weeks before the election to not wish to work in the office.
Organised was the opposite to the Chef of the Hessian President Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF message sents would have lost in the burning, he refused another period of office of the hothanged Chefredactor.
Too short before the choice, there were protests in which the political impact on the ZDF was deteriorated.
In the past, even 35 state judges have been mixed into the debate, which have considered Coch's proceedings as constitutional.
It doesn't have any benefits.
To Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied, pedagogics and romantics.
Then he looked at the Southwest and the Frankfurt.
1983 Frey changed to ZDF, to "thour-journal".
Next: 1988 to 1990 personal referendum of the Chefredactor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 the leader and moderator of the "Morden Magazine" leader of the ZDF external policy; since the leader of the ZDF capital studies.
The Green announced a constitutional statement by Branchenblad Medium magazine on midnight after the election of Brander.
Kochs Widerpart at the Governing Board, the Rheinland-Paltic President Kurt Beck, explained that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that personal proposals of the Intense could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, the outcome of partial politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies was also dealing with Beck.
The prospectual follower Peter Frey had recommended the Administrative Board with a wise choice - by criticizing the body immediately after the burner decline.
Thanks to this fact of journalist independence, both the Scarlets could have been able to nominate him for the posts of the Chefredactor and the Administrative Board without to come to the deceased to lead a party to office.
In the partial arithmetic, Frey is without the left liberal.
Destroyinglum
Participation for students: After a year of education, the Cultural Ministers of the countries finally introduced on Thursday: at a meeting of the Cultural and High School Ministers Conference, both sides agreed to improve the conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to be able to be able to help them too.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test charges: basically, each module should be completed only with a single examination.
Moreover, the labour burden of the employees is to be checked and to ensure "realistic and vulnerable measure".
In addition, high schools and high schools want to simplify the recognition of studies between high schools within and outside Germany.
The countries were committed to make common structural provisions for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
There should be no different country rules in addition to this.
Reduce tests
From the beginning of the student protest in June . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now it was the first time with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to decrease the number of studies partly drasticly: "Each module is usually closed with only one test," it refers to a 30-paper that would have to re-register partially.
The Reinhold Grimm, president of the Acreditation Council, said to be offered a "fault development of content which affected significantly the sustainability".
In addition, "Studiability" should be "the decision-making criteria" in the form.
Modules such as contents are "contacts" to check if "unnecessary agreements of the individuals in the choice of the
Events would be avoided.
Students had "request to get game rooms to enable and promote their own initiatives".
The rules for the authorisation should be made new, but also existing steps in the examination.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, which, however, means that it takes the duration until 2015, until all passengers have been checked.
It is responsible to the acreditation agencies which are subject to the Acreditation Council established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture have invited the countries to influence the agencies in October that the substance is not too large and that the investigation regime is not too decreased.
In individual countries, universities and universities with the Ministers of State have already agreed on appropriate measures.
As the only country, Rheinland-Pfalz said that the Bologna process would be further developed.
In particular, the high schools of money are to strengthen and strengthen the advisory and investigative and foreign areas.
Country and high schools want to use → million euros.
In the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to introduce a Novelle of High School Law into Parliament.
After this, only a single examination should be required for the conclusion of a model.
The facility must be more flexible, also ensure the recognition of performance evidence to other high schools and facilitate access to the master.
To the end of the next year, the country's accessories will be checked on its ability.
Government and opposition repeated the conditions in the country on Thursday.
Besides Lob, however, there was criticism to the decisions.
The Federal Representative of the Juso High School Groups requested that the establishment of the educational policy should not be located in future by the Ministers and High Schools.
As latest after the time of education, the persons who are concerned should now "made a root".
The future academics were supported by the President of the High School Center Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of students," she said at a meeting with the Cultural Ministers with which the HRK is discussing a common reform paper on Thursday.
The Education and Education Affairs (GEW) did not all the decisions of the Bonner: it requested a legal claim that allows each deputy to access to a further master study.
In other cases, the countries must ensure that the present generation of Bachelor students is available tomorrow with best possible conditions, as GEW representative member Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set up more docs.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Mämer
Income to Germany and out there is almost no control..." says the beginning of a weight of Lyriker Werner Sīner, where this is the motivation for the arrival of a dissident who has won the freedom but has lost his language room.
The 1951 born in the Romanian Banat, Werner Sõner had been in Bukarest as German and English teacher and later as a reader in a child booking in 1982 before he translated to Frankfurt am.
Sõner has been exhausted with various literature prices, 1993 he has held the legendary Frankfurter Poetics readings at the University of Goethe, and since 2002 he is head of the Hessian literature forová in the moustonturm in Frankfurt.
For a remarkable extraliterary view, he provided the last Sunday during a meeting in München, where it was "Germanic literature in Romania in the mirror and the levels of their security acts".
It appears to be disappointed and deceived by the Sõner, in which he agreed before Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Francz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration as an IM for the Roman Secret Service Security.
Along with some of the presents, Sõner 1989 received the German language price.
The reckoning trials would have started hardly, first in 1971.
"I am," Sõner said, "so someone who has not been adequate against the security test."
Lyrik Werner Sõner is the IM Walter.
In close to the noble prices for Herta Mâer and its unexampled literary dealing with the dictatoral government mechanisms, the literature zones and, in particular, the Community of German authors originating in Romania will be destroyed by a case that makes known the foundation and degradation of a political system based on monitoring and ambition.
Werner Sõner is, as far as you can say, not only acters, but also victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, according to the guests of the literature scientist Michael Markel, and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter for him.
He had it in all difficult points for him at that time, as Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Sõner's Declaration was unexpected in the form and before this public, but it is not surprising that the knowledge of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Roman secret service is not completely surprising.
Germany was a pleasant reservation for security hospitals, Herta Mıer had already written in July after reading her own acts, 914 pages.
The interested ones, as you can think, are speculated and in some cases have also been aware of what clear names are denied behind the covering names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast with the very safe view of the stasi acts in this country, it is still very diffused to travel with the back-ups of the security monitoring.
A systematic replication has been interrupted and prevented in the past years.
One of the members of Birthler's national Council on the restructuring of the security acts (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the issue of the acts was more draft.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of acts.
That the influence of ancient security members in Romania remained very large, after announcement of the nobel price for Herta Mâer, an interview in which an earlier team-security chief expressed himself adequately over the price charger.
She's got a psychosis, she's just listening to her once.
The inflammation of the power was incredible in the form of the freedom of opinion.
Of course, the case of Sõners, as often in relation to dismissed guilt, is inevitable.
The special reaction of the listeners to the Sõner's announcement is hoped that the continuation of this chapter is more determined than by debt and shame.
It is more than one footnote to enjoy the work of Herta Mâer, who has received the Nobel price yesterday.
Saturation in Champions League
It worked as a chem, just a adreted foreign service from a very good Christmas celebration on which a sports article manufacturer goodies had distributed, when the new VfB-Trainer Christian Gross in the direction of an orange-colored plastic of the equipment went up a fourth hour after midnight to a C-class.
The man with the marvelous glass was able to shoot for his foreign city.
Otherwise he could also drive himself - the alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was so little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is going on.
Or just go right.
In the words of the first three days previously obliged Switzerland: "Although we have reached the 8-final", it is in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1-success against Unira Urziceni from Romania, "but we can't leave us from the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" will stand before Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance all day in Liga.
And re-opened weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), wood (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exemption
The 8th final of the Champions League (Include 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replay 9.10. + 16./17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant position of the babbel follower remained behavior.
Not only in the associated saluter, who provided the uncertain Stuttgarter Professor in short time self-confiance, use preparation and game pleasure.
I came to the players and told them that they should take care of their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, Mr. Gross said that so simple sounding success recept, which had no longer been affected under therapeutic Babbel.
He simplified a certain magic, gave babbel-beet for Jens Lehmann, "if a new impuls comes in the football, sometimes the things that you wouldn't be able."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekly break of hurt, made his dynamic progress to the best player at the place, attempted to describe the founded "fenomen" with the speechful "free wind" and the way of the new representative's work: "He is a man who passes through and requires disiferin.
This is what we need in the present situation."
It was obviously missing under babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports representation Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart was particularly constant.
Like Gross, players and managers also avoided to overevaluate the victory against a replaced and completely forbidden discharge of Roman guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the bad waking had come, gave Khedira to remember.
And the sports report Horst Heldt suggested that a seasonal goal was achieved, but the other is still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That hero was 40. Birthday himself after the first homesieg since three months of celebration, it was at the events of the weekend, which were freshly experienced in the form of a television interview of Torhüter Jens Lehmann in the form of a television interview straight before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others take and not the Jens, the Held contradicted the hard criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the prospect of leadership and decided to change the tragedy on pressing fans.
Even if his free day was shocked after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of failing sovereignty and disgrace.
Lehmann's statements were "depreciated by pure egoism", he kept back and announced consequences for the cousinman.
They're no more friends for life, two forty-years.
However, they always agreed with all others that without the processing by the diluted tragedy team, it would not have been possible to play a strong and fighting idea.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in success," said the Held and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic.
WM Fight in height
Hitziges Duell in Bern: Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard ones, the Ukrainian defended his severe weight title, according to the WBC version.
The sentence of the Court of Justice was a vote.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box-Welt Master in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old campaign, by version of the WBC band, visited the U.S.A. Johnson on the night on Saturday in Bern, by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the title defense after Comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was two-fold world masters of the WBO and WBC communities.
Unfortunately, it hasn't been packed with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his bie on 39 wins in 41 Profi fights, twice he had to be struck due to damage.
In the 24th battle, the challenger Johnson had to take the first delay.
Before approximately 17,000 viewers in the Berner Arena, the 2,02 meter big klitschko wanted to dictate the battle, especially with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced before Duell the end of the Klitschko era, but continued to take up the fights of the world Master, so Klitschko could not decide to bring his annual rights to the goal.
In total, passive Johnson did too little for a demander and tried only to overcome the demanders.
As he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his shots were only rare to meet the world master.
He was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who has passed with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve.
The demander had provided some weapon before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He's stumbled as a "heavy zombies" that "nothing can't be right."
At Wiegen, the champion then caused Johnson to throw the solar brilliant from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth wins for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained successful in the fourth fight after Comeback on 11 October 2008.
After approximately four years of time, he struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned to his "WBC's" whistle that he had to be delivered free of war.
In this year, he wined Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States in his title defense.
In this battle, I only got a shock and I'm physically very good in form, Klitschko had found the quick back in the ring.
But his dream remains the unit of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is World Master of the WBO and IBF.
But the WBA's worm brings the British David Haye after he was able to remove the 2,13 meters of the big Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously rejected a planned fight against Vitali Klitschko in September.
Its promotional company has already planned the fight against Klitschko in London Wembleystadion.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chairman Jürgen Trittin, Defence Minister Gutttenberg, because of false information about Kunduz business as lying.
SPD and Left request up from the cancer.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest knowledge of the air attack of Kunduz, the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has submitted a conscious disturbance.
The Minister said to the death bombing on two tanks in September "will be aware of the uncertainty" on Saturday, Green Group Chairman Jürgen Trittin said in the ARD news sentence "Dagesview".
It's called the landscape: he's lying.
The murder order was granted under the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the NATO report, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became that the attack was not only a decrease of the discharged loads but also the purpose of killing two Taliban leaders.
Dutch Kunduz Commander Small U.S.A. has been murdered or hurt up to 142 people, according to Nato investigation report.
Green, SPD and Left requested on Saturday, Bundescanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the covenant day and to clothe what Gutttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel must be clothing whether the objective of the murder is a part of the Afghanistan Policy of the Federal Government - and whether the officer, the federal war and the news service have approved these new areas, the Jürgen Trittin and the Green College Renate Künast.
Governing speaker Ulrich Wilhelm determined the criticism.
The Conference Board has not influenced the specific elements of the Federal War in Afghanistan, as he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts on the representation of the Minister on the back foundations of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs were correctly and completely informed about the back foundations of the Tanclaster attack.
Often it had said that they would have denied the existence of Nato-beaches and have provided sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from the area of the two officers, they would have noted the Defence Ministry even to several reports, including a two-side document of the Commander Chief and a field-old report.
Included in a letter to clarify the matter, the "Frankfurter General Sunday magazine" reports.
He hasn't received a answer until now, it's said.
The Ministry did not refer to the proposals on Saturday and stressed that this would be concluded in the investigation committee of the Federal Day, who wanted to constitute it on the next middle-week.
Dreaming worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in psychological diseases and in the outcome, the limits between imagination and reality are disrupted.
As long as it sleeps, everything's fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give us the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
But whoever takes traumatismable conditions in the growth, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, most in the modern west world is to be foolish or drugs, at least special.
However, such images and voices occur not only in psychological diseases or in the outcome.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses to draw images or to write Romans are to ensure that the limits between dream, laughing and reality disappear.
Dreamly changed warning conditions can occur in the various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case, in the worst case.
Even if the exhibitor and effect may distinguish, the visions of mystical Hildegard of Bingen, the experiences of the New Age Propetition Carlos Castaneda, Scamanic exciting conditions, psychosis and hallucine, can be returned to similar processes.
Halluzine or boxes occur when the equivalent of the neuronal bottles of the brain - all before dopamin, noradadrenaline, serotonine and acetyl cholin - is discontinued and the interaction of various brain components is deteriorated.
Complicated hallucine and disappointed thoughts are very often occurring during a skizoprified psychosis.
The strength has no power over him anymore
The connection of weeping and dream has been occupied with philosophy and medicals since the ancient.
Aristoteles recognized Halluzin as a form of the tragedy in the wake, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatric, founded in 1861 a "great similarity of irreseen with dreams", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was "a psychosis, with all the injustices, inhabitants, insights of such a thing".
It is Herbst 2001 when Henning T. is converted into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
The strength has no power over him anymore, he's weakening at the room cover.
He's looking for a trick.
After him flipped devils with bluetrotes, burned fractions, dental flashing.
They hunt him, catched him with heavy, flaming steels, cast him against the walls, he seems the pains in the whole body.
A sound, bad voices dry from walls and radios.
He can't do it anymore, the voices that embrace him and discipline him.
Henning T. travels two cables from the stereo facility, shoots them to a screen and fixes them on a cover at the cover.
He ascends to a sound speaker and puts the shirts around his neck.
Shut up.
The shirts go.
This will be a lesson to you, crying the voices in a fucking cror, "Go to the clinic and let you go!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has learned six acute psychoses, the last remains 2 years, the first nearly 20 years.
It was released by LSD.
His diagnosis sounds schizoeffective-paranoid psychosis, and he is also manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, the many, the sharkfrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness since three years he has been married.
In the psychosis, I have learned the worst and the deepest disappointment, he says.
The truck images are cruel reality
About a pro of the population is sick at least once in the lives of shaphphrenie, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the most common disease after depression.
In a acute skizophrenese psychosis, those concerned are mostly not able to distinguish between the internal and external world, they are advised to a overwhelmed condition that can lead to hallucine, sizes, relations or persecution.
The votes that command, comment or dialogue are spread by the hearing of votes.
In addition, optical halucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate from an insignificant, the brain can't filter any signs, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the clues for a flow of ideas and fantasias, which deeper consciousness occurs.
The reality conservation in the psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Ober · the clinic for General Psychiatries in the University Clinic Heidelberg.
The shizoprene is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning to him.
At the same time, he drives into a passive role, he will, like in the dream, overcome the events and cannot make it active.
So shizophrenes are often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality synchronization is mostly not possible for them, the truck images are cruel reality, excluding waking.
Once in life to have a hallucination
Other than in the dream, says Fuchs, "but the reasonable and spatial structure of the reality that is taken into the psychosis is based on."
The fascinating thoughts and hallucinity are in reality, the promotion of experience is located in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain swallows Capriolens, researchers still stand in front of racing.
Exceptions may cause everyone to lose reality shortly, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be given a genetic investment to the shopfrenie, but the Zwilling studies have shown that the genes are not the only designers.
Scientists believe that in those concerned, the minimum brain damage occurs.
We believe that the neuronal reeffect of the brain is in a early stage of development, by a mother’s virus disease during pregnancy, for example, occurs fuchs.
But there remains a raw, as the slowing of the neuronal system is, which is not even manifesting over many years.
Environmental impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the exhibitor for a psychosis if the disposal is available.
In addition, halluzine is able to solve psychoses because they are involved in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer under their hallucination and cut tired medicines to lose them, others give money for which to get, says the Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Boxen.
Whether travel images are felt pleasant or unappreciated, it is often only a question of the position.
Boxet has collected reports about Halluzin and Truger events since years, in the past year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Header".
Although hallucinity belongs to the typical aspects of psychoses, many other diseases are also surprised.
This includes along with psychical screening such as borderline or depression often also diseases such as Migrone, Epilepsie, Multiple Sklerose or Alzheimer and School Heart Traumata.
Surprisingly, it is hallucinated under certain conditions that the brain is self healthy.
Halluzine, such a box, is combined from memory contents usually retained.
They occur when the Hirnareale, in which the minds are exposed, are overactive or too small; if our brain is heavy or even when the stimulation is missing.
● This status can be exhausted as brain damage or a psychosis.
But even the royal train, stress, love rooms or other mental exceptional conditions.
In younger ones, it has given up to one third of the questionnaires to have at least once in life a Halluzination.
In Summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg forpommers and visits the Gymnasium.
It's a very normal girl.
If the pictures and voices weren't there.
In the pause, it may occur that a crazy boy with a long, dark hair matches it.
When he answers, the colleagues look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the sweet girl for a disappointed daily dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's wake up, she's listening and looking at this boy like she's listening to the girl in the bank near and looking.
She can even see his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy? She's wondering sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other trucks are not real and go back.
Nights are most terrifying
Often the truck images are also a burden.
When she sits in the class room, she can't sometimes follow the educational substance because the teacher in their eyes and ears just presents a new colleague, while he presents for all others mathematical comparisons to the table.
In the night, the appearances are most terrifying.
If she waits in her dark room for the sleep, which comes too rare and too late, she often can not distinguish whether she is wake or already dreamed, whether the images she see the breasts or the girl with the bloody wounds of arms and legs, appear before her open or closed eyes.
Let me be calm, she'll call the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything about what they would think they'd be crazy.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She was the Abitur in the past year and le with her friend.
A year ago, the Halluzin stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychological box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
A residence is also a plastic work of disturbance
If someone is socially isolated or suffers under the royal train, he has with great probability after a time Halluzin, says the box.
I think the brain is then busy and cares for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had a little girl before other children, often played alone.
Her Halluzin began when she learned with 13 that the man whom she called Dad since she could think she was not her body father.
Since in visual and acustic Halluzine are active the same areas of brain, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish those concerned like Sarah K., trag images and reality. "Each experience," says the box, "see in the brain place, the reality is represented there.
Halluzine is also pictures that make the brain rise, so they act so real."
Even nightly dream images are worth boxes as a form of Hallucination.
Halluzins are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to shizoprenes, psychicals are able to recognize their truck images as irreal.
Thus, the box advises his patients to appreciate the hallucine also as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experience is most pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefar, the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapie of Florence Nightingale disease home in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also provides positive, creative - also is an artistic work of disturbance.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called uneurophid experience, a special form of the traumatismly changed guardian conscience.
Oneiroides are high complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer feels real and that he can also not distinguish from the growth.
The uneuroid consciousness state occurs in extremity of trauma or illness, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience a motor lamp in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, as well as by persistent, complete movement incapacity, he replaces the life threatening reality with a own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, Schmidt Degenhard says.
A kind of limit between dream and hallucination.
Since a situation in reality is not possible, a world change is located, but the real situation is compared to the imagination.
A intensive form of understanding and sense in a situation that allows us to have our own ability to not be undergone in nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Moreover, the Zurcher Kun Restaurant Peter Cornelius describes his uneiroid experiences in the book "Herz Change" as the life's salvation action.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a cardiovascular operation with the following heart transplantation has occurred daily on travels, while his body is condemned at the intensive station for unmotionalness.
However, in a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he is a man of an old man, on the board of a train sanatorium, a robot is waiting for his health.
In the early middle age, he makes the blood-production.
If a Greek is slipped on the engine road in his home country, he surrounds with Spitalbed in the alpes' snow and comes to a Korean mafios.
He goes completely in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travels are fundamentally different from each dream.
The dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are overwhelmed by years and in similar details.
Increasingly and intensely than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizon of our other worldwide experiences, says the Psychiater Schmidt Degenhard.
The last end shows oneuroides, psychoses, hallucine and outlooks, how useful our internal images of the external reality are also in the watch.
Each change in the state of consciousness, resumed by the psychological box, can lead to a transformation of what we call reality.
A experience that may also be ambiguous.
Snow break can come
Burda
Children should take the 27-year-old shipment
The new leader Calllen is a middle solution: long-term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into his two children's hands, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding will also belong to 100 Pro of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The Foreigner Hubert Burda sees his company long-term in his children's hands.
Both children have 27 years of inheritance and have the strong will to enter into the company, the 69-year-old said to SPIEGEL.
We have made the details of it carefully.
The question of whether they are active in the company is the first question.
The question is also if they are able to do it.
You can't imagine 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently able.
This causes children to kill and the company too.
Burda said on Thursday that he returned from the president from January, and called Paul-Bernhard Kallen for followers.
The 52-year-old call has been a representative member in Burda since 1999.
In time, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the area Treasury, the responsibility for business capacity and after Jürgen's separation of mortal authors was also responsible for direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the deposit.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to "overwritten 10, 15 years", such as Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100% of the family in future, said Burda.
With a view to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that also family enterprises are not safe before falling: "This was always the case of families who were attracted from a capitality that had completely spending themselves and thought that they could rise to a very large player.
I never had it.
He's gone "no world power dreams," so Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was springer, and I don't want to play in the world with 'time', these countries have become too large.

The most different Dekoletes
Wednesday is always closer and therefore it is a chance again to copy the look of the stars and to get their clothes in our clothes.
The form of the decolette, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The song Fergie has chosen a overwhelmed and very complicated decollete, which can only be abrased.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The Energy Society endsa, together with the city Barcelona, created the "Live Office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "Live Office" (Logistic for the introduction of the electrocar) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electrocar in the city and take agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subventing, etc.
On the other hand, project MOVELE is just developed to promote the electrical car and opinions and measures in the areas that are involved.
This is a trial forwarding the transport means of the future.
3 "Electrical towns"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be shared in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the Government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The Electricity Undertaking endsa has already undergone a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generality).
This Framework Treaty wants to promote the A's research and development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These A's are, among others, related to the energy and their efficiency.
However, it is not the only initiative to participate in the ends in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups throughout Europe and discusses a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "a Horizon of rest" for the car sector
The president of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, prophesied by the Spanish car industry, which is the grave exporter of the country, "a Horizon of the calm".
In the 2009 economic report, the Governing Chairman report, Zapatero reported once again the initiatives that the Government has made to support the car sector during the Government year.
"without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we had today a panorama of deterioration and distressing of some of our main production works," said the Government president.
"In order to produce this plan and the preparation of car manufacturers, even in the future in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a safe Horizon for the presence of this industrial wheel, which is our gross export industry," he adds.
He also noted that the plan for competitiveness, the part of the total plan for the car industry (PIA) provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which again provided for investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Governing Boss explained that these investments are determined for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also emphasized the Government's adoptions to encourage the application, as well as the Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Governing Boss , this plan allows the exhaust gases to reduce the average of 6 % in the Spanish market, which resulted in a "powerous growth" in the authorisations that increased "approximately 40 Pro".
On 200,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first department of the international classic cars is made, an exhibition for experts and favorites of the world of engines.
This messe will be located in Pabellón de Cristal del Casa de Campo in Madrid from 5 to 7 February 2010.
This will lead 200 internal and foreign publishers to their marks on a exhibition area of 200,000 square metres.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportability
Mazda wants to prove that sports are compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason Mazda has recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and control system, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is available only for the 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 has developed through their good notes on the entire image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, the behaviour, the mechanism, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very well" at the new Mazda3.
In the preliminary seats, the previous seat can be found to offer an excellent engineering and good holding.
Moreover, the road's game is exhausted.
In further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda with a number of buttons and switchers in the viewing colors is red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend is a future indicator.
This style reminds us partially of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further, that both the Mazda 3, and the Civic, both Japanese models, from the nutrition of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf that all want to meet.
The road gateway of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four wake up with the car can be able to drive.
To all this, there comes a gross and clearly formed coffee room.
The stop and control system is available until now only for the 2-liter benzin engine with 150 PS and a 6-gagment engine.
This engine is a real pleasure. He comes through his enemyness, through his mild sounds, his performances, and by his small consumption.
And all those who do not run a lot of kilometers per year should take into consideration this i-stap with the benzin engine because of his gross comfort in the gain and the small consumption, even if Mazda is mostly the dental models.
In respect of the compensation, the model that is called Sportive is chosen for the sample, because it has a significant major number of elements from the series.
In particular, the driving track change assistant (RVM) is drawn up to the dead angle, but also the components for the traction and stability, the speed schedule, the alignment of the internal level, the boardcomp, with a gross screen, the sensors for parking, an independent climate installation, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and Audio Bluetooth, as well as the crossed 17-toll feet.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if it was not enough for compensation, the Premium package containing the following for the additional EUR 1.500: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon scanner and the sound system BOSE with CD-loading.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is especially exciting about the materials used, because of its conduct and the case of compensation.
Moreover, those who do not set a lot of kilometers a year can also buy the i-stoop version that is available only with a 2.0 benzin engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model is, however, a little high price between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the sports model.
As opposite to this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the highest passenger.
A Premier with a lot of glamour

Our "Pe", as elegant as always, disappeared for a dark "Lady" clothes.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is primarily limited, a device with which you can read only your emails, without a possibility to see some attachments or to survive via the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes praising when it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the punishment is more unlikely, but the idea of itself is, however, especially for young people who are interested.
In contrast to the artphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very favorable flatrate, for example only the half of the price of the iPhone flatrate.
After the company has seen the success, it has brought two new devices on the market: one that is only thinking for Twitter, the other with a lifetime freezer for data, in contrast to the peek, where you have to pay a six-fold price.
Fonpeek, presented in the event Le Web yesterday, is the version of this finding and thus its version.
However, it has the same limits as his opposite, a surprise has been prepared.
The monthly holiday price for the phone, approximately 12 euros per month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with an artphone around the world know what it means to delay all the data to read their e-mails soon as you have passed the country border or if you are trying to find a café with WIFI (or a connection option to telephone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is unbelievable and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign residence, but after my experience, you have already needed a doctor title in physics and a dictionary brilliant to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission in respect of crucial roaming tariffs for all Europe remained almost always incompatible.
In addition to its own country, you always have to read his e-mails and it rightly.
That a small device such as FonPeek (when it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, though it can not offer this type of tariff, means that the phone providers must slowly, but safely reflect and begin to take into account various options how they can use their data network.
Childle is another example, in his prices, the download of books and other requests are contained on the Internet.
Without a wheat and without a haken.
This is a internet-capable device, and it is only one time paying for it, namely for purchasing, not for month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchasing opportunity with lifelong Internet access, like the Peek already offers in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
I especially expect this because I believe that it would be a suitable model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetical Colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favorite color of the first Lady.
When Barack Obama arrives at the office, they appear in a dress and a mantel of this color and has chosen the same color again to join him, without doubt the second important moment in life: the delivery of the peace nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama made in both cases very similar models: auvrer that it was almost the same colour - a lightwearing green - the dress of three parts - clothes, jackets and mantels from the same substance, and thus brought it something grossly stitched or a cotton.
It is even so that at first looking it seemed that the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturia and had decided to take the same clothes at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of substance from which they are separated.
At the introduction of the office, she brought a clothing from the top and in Oslo of a sampled sampling.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-height depths and for the second time a single model, but gold colours.
Also, the frisur was different every time: the hair was thrown up as hairkranz at this occasion, and at the previous time she was opening the hair.
75% of the affected mothers have experienced problems in the work because of their motherhood.
Discrimination in the work has increased in the last years, especially in the younger women who want children.
This is the result of the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women "Freeability and Care of Women in Spain".
The investigation between 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years is no doubt: 75% of the employed women see their charity accounts limited on the job because of their motherhood.
It shows that there is a major subdivision in the decision to establish a family and there is the number of children, after whether women work or not, and if they exercise what kind of profession they exercise.
Those who do not work otherwise outside the house will work only for half day or have no fixed work contracts will be mothers and children.
In contrast, women with a firm position, especially in the public area, move the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have less children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed position will receive their first child only in the average of 3.7 years after the meeting, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed position, which has longer been used to do this, and who have gathered it and the first child has been performed much later.
Auverdem also has a gross impact on maternity, even if less than the calendar on receipt preparation," says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another actor that must be taken into account in the age of women in the marriage and the first child.
According to the investigation, the age is about at the date of the marriage and the first child, according to the level of education.
This subdivision could also be found in women the same age.
For example, women in the group were between 35 and 49 years, after they had only the main school conclusion or a rational education, in the average of 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time of their mother.
Moreover, according to their education level, there is another difference between women.
As women with a primary conclusion already married before their first establishment and received their first child, women with a middle or high school closure make it different, seeking a fixed position and marrying and then getting their first child, Delgado fixes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German viewer will be the image of various products of the mark and also the general advertising "Because you are worth it".
The main representative of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant games at international level, will become a more famous exhibition as before its Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope.
Before her, the latest who were able to attend this exclusive club were Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freeda Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In men, the cosmetic formula has only exceptional boots: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Cheap Game College of Evangelines in "Lost").
The price grant of the British industry
The Brits have a major root in the environment.
Your highest representatives - designers and models, both yesterday and today - met the annual price delivery held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
In this case, they were all surprised.
The former Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent is presented in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) to the three-wide Röntgen images of writers who have joined him in literary life (and, in some cases, including in real life).
It does not use a predictable and fearful influence genre (screen biography, life and work), but seeks an equivalent to the glorious part of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save any fears or lights.
Auvrir that this book is a ability reader, it is also a moved request for reading and reading again.
Here are some extracts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his sides, I found that the Mediterranean is not sea, but much more a spiritual, almost sensible tribe, just as I always felt, without having found words: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy shick Hall, the moral without guilty and the innocentness without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, alegory Christ, he wrote about what he was in the blood, not in mind, between unkindness and ignorance, with a reverse poetical humor, without any meaning, like the masterkins who had killed him almost."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was joined by this woman with a suffering that suffered for three years, so in her bound, in which the emotions were associated with the pleasure of the marriage, a spiritual privilege that was to come to heaven on the way of the destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was issued in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 gipfels in the worldly literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, on which the best mountains are always trying again."
About William Faulkner: "There was a funny crap.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a good owner of the grave, and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams came from a certain grave."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the famine crying, which was shot out from a bridge from his personality from monkeys, so that his echo to the depth of the 20th century held his literary way in his literary way. This he made by a trip where he fled from himself and with a speech of full violence before the worms the neighborhood.
About Dorothy Parker: "Every day she joined herself and prayed: My worshipper God, I pray you to do all that is in the power, so that I finally stop writing a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On the grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the wind of the ports,/ the rest after the war,/ after a sad life, you will enjoy death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her pack, she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spioned her between the Azaleen or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other case in which the man had suffered so much and was delivered into a neurotician whose literary talent was much more gross than his folly."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos rather than try to joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he didn't bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What, then, did this do to destroy the glory of that man so that he might put himself on this mighty one?"
Five Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went through our city part in the city of Fuenlabrada as suddenly a group of youths between 15 and 18 years near her and our dog, our dog is a mixing that we have taken from the animal home and weighted just six kilo, and then from the heavy sky they lost him two footsteps and hurt him hardly.
Our disappointment can't be able to believe in words, because it's incomprehensible for us, since the pass on a pleasant agression against a small and unhelpful animal, which, of course, has been carried out on the lin.
This is the emergency attack, which a woman who was stuck to space, when she wanted to correct these persons because of the case, she even feared her own life, for if such a widow attacked a dog, he might be the same with a woman, a child, an elder man or probably with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally aligned town quarter at five hours afternoon on a very common Tuesday.
The dog has spent the whole day.
Of course, in a nearby police office, we have a great doubt of whether this will bring something and prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the figs of Spanish crimes were.
Our disappointment on the event has encouraged us to show this incident.
We can't understand what in the heads of these young people must be done that they find a pleasant attack on an unhelpful animal, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't know where the education and respect have remained towards animals and persons.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helm
In collaboration with the Spanish Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the relief manufacturer Michelin has invited a campaign to promote the use of healing, especially in the younger engine railway drivers, such as both companies today.
This initiative wants to take note of the importance of heat use, since this is finally the only protection element that can prevent headfractions or even death in the case of a motor radar failure.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is a part of its commitment in relation to the security of the deployment, which "includes much more than only the design and manufacture of products that will always be safer every day" and continued to confirm that it is also with other actions of pedagogical and informative characteristics to draw closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of healing on the motorrad running under the Slogan 'to be or not to be' will distribute places in a first phase to over 500 motor radar stations to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin emphasised that the security of constant concerns is the company, and just because it is always committed to the development of more safe products as a two-rad vehicle manufacturer.
The sale of small layers grows again.
After almost two years, the car starts to see a light at the end of the dark tunnel for small transporters.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6 % in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first growth of the numbers presented by the Manufacturer Group of Anfac and the Manufacturer Group of Ganvam after 22 months of continuous decrease.
However, these good numbers are to be decreased in time only with a huge care, since the reference data for the comparison of November 2008, which was a very bad year of decrease of 60 % in relation to the previous year.
However, it must be reminded that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total assessments of these 11 months remain under 40% of the sales payments of the previous business year.
Since January, in total, 95.853 vehicles have been purchased, but all vehicles from which the small transporter consists are included: personal vehicles, pick-ups, small transporters, small cars and smaller cars/facilities.
Moreover, the same clouds in the sky are still the same, which most of them take the request in competition, for even if some of the vehicles are covered by persons, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which, in almost 100 % of all cases, are purchasing the purchases with a third financing.
In this way, these restrictions, which are the results of the returned credit institutions, must be included in addition to additional instruments such as increase in the rate of worklessness or the rate of the bad economies.
In this panorama and in the subdivision to the cars, the financial support was little helped to buy a vehicle of Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only determined for individuals, but also for self-determined and small enterprises have the right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 output that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the lower sales are speaking for themselves.
Ganvam had noticed that it was necessary for the State to direct a special attention to these small loads and, of course, to the industrial vehicles (carriage and buses).
The car trade union prophesyed for 2010 a similar year as the past, for which it has been calculated by 19% with a sale accident (in a person's cars and cars) for 2010.
Support for Brems Manufacturers in critical situations is now obligation
As at that time in the ABS anti-blocking breaming system and as it is currently implemented with the Stability Control Control, the braking assistance systems must be an obligation in the cars in emergency.
In fact, they are already responsible for all newly authorised person power cars and easy transporters, and for the rest of vehicles a care period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The Union's committee aims to improve the protection of footnote, but these breaming systems can also help to prevent many learning accidents.
The task of the no-bream assistant is to carry out more pressure on brems in the case of a critical brake manager, which the system recognises by the brake force carried out by the driver on the bream pipeal.
However, this system does not perform this pressure until it is closed.
According to an investigation given by the Component Manufacturer for Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers in an accident, before the constellation, had no longer reached the bremsheet and the half of them had not been broken with full force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
Nevertheless, the breaming aid takes the brake system with maximum strength and reduces the breathing time and thus the breathing distance returned by a car during the breaming process.
According to a EU rate, up to 1.100 mortal accidents, in which fucking persons are injured, could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of nobrem assistant.
There would be even less accidents - it would be estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal damage - soon the so-called intellectual nobrem systems will be .
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognises obstacles (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while it is already exercising a light pressure on the breaming.
If the driver reacts to it, the system will help him to add the pressure on the bremsheet if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the composition is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as less as possible.
General Motors varies the plan for Opel to January
Since the population of Opel Work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to bring the Opel Saving Plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to demonstrate that the party concerned already agrees on each point of the plan.
And therefore, it may be that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be moved to beginning 2010.
However, the GM will ensure that in the next days a decision on the sale of Saab will be taken.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has made the pressure on the carbatters in order to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows to stay in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, however, wins the option of the Netherlands Sports Manufacturer of Skyper, who has the Russian Group of Converg, increasing access.
If none of these buyers should reach an agreement, GM could deal with some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to slew Saab's end of the year, if it has not been crucified until that year, will continue to continue.
The tax of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
The engineers used the Boxster S as a foundation for the development of their latest and very thirsty juwels, but they actually made it easier for 80 kilo, which now brings only 75 kilo to the waage.
In order to create such a thing, they declined first to the automatic expansive dach that was replaced by a cell-introduction in hand, so that it was solemn of 21 kilo; thanks to the Aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "from" 15 more; by the exemption of the climate install again 13 times; above all, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so that they were included more 7 kilo; by the building of sports bacquet sites again 12 times, and with the light 19-toll branches again.
Then, by the delay to the audio system CDR-30, there were still six kilo less and by the exchange of door attacks through grips of substance, the missing kilo was reached.
Although he is also available with the double-grouped PDK, the sample was carried out with a vehicle with 6-operating hands, mainly on the smaller landscapes of California, on mountain streets that actually were very cursive.
If you do, you can only give him the note free.
However, the reduction of his weight has no longer resulted in that he would no longer be so safe on the punishment.
It is rather the opposite of the case: since a long time, we have no longer performed such a small and light model, but at the same time there is a feeling of gross security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small atlete, able to make his muscles warm at a low walk in the necessary time until we give him the orders to raise, brems to recover and then get everything out of the engine...
He's doing everything you can tell him. The car's doing everything we're doing with his hands on the lineroad, thanks to his binding, which is as communicative as precise as well.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgery.
A engine sound for all directions
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster S) has been able to make it up with the 'sport' option and using a system that can change the engine sounds, which already came to use at the Panemara.
Acceleration capacity is increasingly brutal, whether or not, or when renewable.
The Federations are strong, but not hard or unbequem.
The asphalt on the landscapes on which we were walking with the Boxster Spyder was already quite covered, but the car was well-scattered.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole street; and, despite some of these curves, we found iron in the morning green and rollsplitt on the morning.
Comprehensively, you can say that it is an ultra-easy car, a car with which you have an undescriptive driving passport, as it may be rarely exists and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EUR.

Basconia is giving himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many excited players in Dusko Ivanovic, a great triumph with 82-91 attending the complicated fubball field of Maccabi Electra and coming to the first place within his group after the gross attack of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times of the best of his manship (29 in the evaluation).
The manship from Vitoria was able to replace the significant accidents of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a huge dose of use and team work, even if they were waiting for their victory until the bitter end.
The beautiful steps from the perimeter with 16 evaluated three times contributed to their final winning.
The game started with the driving of the blaurotes that sat from the beginning to the top on the display table.
Since the first four of the manship from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to realize that they had come to the game field with well-heated hands.
There were English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was almost different, only that the manship from Álava disappeared for a inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received at his back to the manship with piffs and applause, which is his house to continue to build their benefit until the pause (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight as the best of his mastership with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter already learned that this would not be the best night of Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear benefit in the pause, the Maccabs wanted to remind the Vitorianers that not everyone wins on their game field, and thanks to the re-attaching "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini were determining to make the "Gulden" turn the ruder (50-49).
More Necks
The team of Ivanovic, wounded, but all other than dead, had to prepare a couple of games with matching security to get air again and suddenly came to one of them the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three nearly following triples and with the support of English and Ribas, to ensure that on the display table was shown a more relaxing distance from (54-67) that the guest was able to disturb the guest at the end of the quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were blown in the last quarter and the English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to leave them the victory they had deserved honestly in the first three minutes.
Yet, Pnini and Eidson resigned, who were not the best of their community and tried to restore their mastership by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though spliters were put out of the place because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not stop, defended himself well, and even if the Israelite was still repeated in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel A日 for the first time in this season.
Damage prevented Unicaia from offering the stear
Unicaja lost sounds in Greece against Olympiacos and the leader in the group B of the Euroligue had to fall down to him, and it was known in a game that was easily facilitated by the outcomes of the players of Unicaia (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the internal game.
The master from Malaga had not before voting in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor before the genetic community, which may be one of the greatest Europe and many money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusiers were able to begin dreaming. A aggressive defense and three follow-up three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the guest blew with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of his Unicaia, even though the inhabited community with a internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis resulted in that the display table showed its benefits in the 13st minute 22-20, the minute in which it would almost come to the shopping between the two American Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualifiated.
The Greek team began to become finally warm and his overlook on two halfs of the games, while the separation of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three caused mistake of Carlos Jiménez clearly tracked at Unicaia.
Under their players in the interior field and the Lithuanian example Linas Kleizas, with his three-folds, they increased their benefit in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A recurrence was impossible
The quarter of the games was guarded by many attacks against the manship of Olympiacos, which showed himself despite his 19 losses and even made it possible to compare the undershread of the game in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which returned to the drive within the group to the black.
Unicaja tried to stop over the many accidents and the separation of the wounded shot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, the federal management and the three-fold Cook and the use of Lewis came back a little hope to 66-57.
However, it was impossible because the Olympiacos, immediately attacked and showed his overallness with centimeters within the corner area, was not to breathe.
Croatian Captain Nikola Vujcic made it in the 37th minute to increase the corb difference to 81-62 and Unicaia had to be struck and had to stop the leadership of Olympiacos.

Now Facebook users can learn their contents that they should deserve due to their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search machine with most displays of immobility, location offers and cars in Spain.
The Tool "How many you should deserve?" calculates the user's containers based on more than 140,000 postal offers available in Trovit in Spain. The users are available in Facebook to enter their profession, profession, age and the city where they work.

Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian Government has set a period for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The president taken from the Office must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010 when its mandate is officially running
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the Hungarian capital, visited the TV translator Globo that "Mel" woman had to leave the message that he had found asyl since 21 September before that date.
"He's claimed that he must go on 27 January since his mandate is running on that day and he has to look for a new apartment."
The sender also cited the former president who visited his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the reverse of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya said at the phone.
After the walls on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo appeared as winner) Zelaya assured that he will remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this declined Zelayas to recognize the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to force him to be the "de facto" government under the president of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the closest days since the past early year, where the inflation of the active was the pre-government voting on the markets, the markets have returned the uncertainty, which is not wonderful, since this is their natural state, in a environment where the makers make decisions about one of the insecure future.
The debt used to stabilise the markets was to compare the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow indirectly the liquidity free hand to rates that move around the zero to buy the assets to cancel.
The central banks have already concluded that the direct purchase of Activa is as well as completed and, without putting in question their heterodox into question of liquidity, begin to strike a sand into the throats, as the ECB has no longer considered with its annual increase in the next week.
Therefore, investors in the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without these heterodox inputs, and we are just going to be witnesses of a conversion in reduction of risk premies.
The flights of the borses and the differences in the business bones are again, even if they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to impose the private risks and the state debts re-increased.
Now the quality is replaced, and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred location of investors, which leads to an increase in the differences in the Eurozone countries in view of Germany.
Spain was not yet affected by this episode of instability, but then the Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new review of Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not damaging to bring the defensors of the moral risk to weakness, which have again been trying to make a conscious conscience to the responsibles of the world economy policy for what they had caused, since they had distorted the devastating effects that have led to the limitation of credits to loss of jobs when they had to give a new day to thanks.
In spite of the fact, what has been done in Dubai, it is deemed to go to a tribe war between the Emirates to restore the power in the emirates and the development in Greece has already been predicted.
A government that dismiss the government's debt, walls and a new government that goes on the same street.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin Hungary saves the beginning of the year from the non-heritage of its foreign payments and thus allows a Euro Member State to do its obligations no longer.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparency and to take its citizens with the obligation to maintain the stability of the State money in the need of obstacles.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some exhibitions too high amounts, it would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to be anxiety as long as the differences in the state debt are increased by the same speed as the business bonds.
However, if the subsequent subsequences were reduced and the Spanish continued to increase, it would be a special risk of Spanish.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. Currently, the previous indicators force a major part of the market research institutions to provide their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which returned again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, does not promise any long lifetime despite warnings.
Repeatly it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to purchase Spanish actions, although it is noted at the moment "Previously on driving".
Associated branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was first set before Parliament's subcommittee in the next two years.
After the occurrence that the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind the closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and more 60 billion billion from that date to 2030, provided that the current nuclear powers are still in operation.
If this is not the case, the needed investment would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should not invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
The question will be changed since 2020, and the performance should be increased.
His proposal could be addressed both on gas and carbon works with engines to start carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it concludes that 18,000 MW are needed more, of course by other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft for a sustainable economy, which has just been predicted by the Government, is on a line with what his company asked, would in no way say something against this law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political situations in the fight against climate change.
See the opinion of "the long-term point is clearly placed on this direction, despite some of the individuals", as she addressed the president of Iberdrola.
Be like, Galan thinks that you should take the decisions on investment, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and have to create a stable balance framework to attack them.

The Australian infrastructure market, however, provides vital building work and Implementation, has a burden that is applicable to overcome because only the purchasing of a domestic building undertaking is accessible.
An area that has been followed by the companies referred to as highly or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must be pursued by the Spanish builders.
In this market, it has only reached access only through its share of 30 % to the high depth, owner of the Leighton.
Millions in Active
In this geographical area, Acciona is of great importance to the sector, where it is already very important because of its activity as energy providers and in the dissalting industry.
In addition, it has already been in Victoria its gross wind molecular park (192 MW) and leads to the group of companies assigned to build and manage Adelaide's dissalting facility with a budget of 700 million.
His purpose is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to get access to the branch building and infrastructure.
The under-term mautstreck, promoted by the City Infrastructure Office of Brisbane and led Northern Link (Northern Doctor), aims to connect the west car in Toowong with the roadway in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 km through tunnel. This is the gross movement to stauring on Brisbane's strains.

The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since beginning 476,4 million.
The Champions League has since 1992 developed a reception source for the fubball clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken from 476,4 million, which introduces them the fifth place of the football clubs that have deserved most money in the liga.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the EUFA Champions League does not only bring glory to herself, but it is also one of the main sources of the large units.
According to the EUFA, the Liga has distributed up to 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 members (of 12 Spanish) which participate in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.

The official Catalogue Master and the last winner of the former European Cooper 1992 is the fifth place.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern München, two men, which, above all, also participate in the past Champoins League.

On the other hand, Spain is only at the place of the countries who could take money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, contrary to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contrast is explained by the complicated monetary distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.

The last four gets four million.
The winner deserves 9 million, contrary to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million income.
Barça again deserved wins at the supercup in August 2,5 million.
However, the variable payments for which 337,8 million are expected are still available.
This money will be granted proportionally to the value of each individual television.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has four places assigned.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed by the number of games they play at this year's date.
Neweva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% share in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has made details about the acquisition boat of assets that will purchase a maximum limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A prosecution that does not force it to make a public invitation (opa) due to the number of actions.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per action payable for years and with an interest of 1 % per year due to this movement.
Wednesday, the socio-actions declined with 1.85 euros, therefore Nueva Rumasa evaluated the company 18% under the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The boat is connected to the nomination of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives the shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in the sale of their actions.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this boat, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been contacted with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the payment would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Sos continues to structure its business management.
In trying to stay at the border of possible purchasing boats and his ex manager's jurisdiction, the brethren Jesus and Jaime Salazar gave the nomination of Maria Luisa Jordan as leader of the internal book review.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high post in the food business.
It is a newly created post which is directly subject to the Chairman of the Group.
This is all other than free of Polemic because the company has been committed in a judicial battle because of the deduction of over 230 million of Sos to other societies of the family of Salazar.
It can not be excluded that Sos will take place another capital during the following months.
As regards Salazar's credit, former Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaia) came to the national assembly and assured that they had approved the release of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exemption of Paternina submitted by the Investment Society Mer
The National Börsen Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation for Federico Paternina submitted by the Investment Society on 9 October.

CNMV also reported that this boat on the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina is aimed at a price of 7,65 euros per action, which is more than 8,95 % of the company capital, which consists of 6.142.786 euros in shares authorised by Madrid and Bilbao.
Moreover, 5.592.778 million actions have been established in no way until the conclusion of the claim and their price of Federico Paternina has been established in accordance with legal laws.
New programmes for the use of vehicles
In these days, unwholes and accidents are not only deserved by KFZ workshops
Each day, thousands of vehicles that have been involved in an accident are dragged into the workplaces where a contractor must evaluate the injury and the costs for the reparation.
No single accident is equal and the cost management of parts and worktimes can be a long-term and complicated task.
The repair of 200,000 to 300,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
However, with the support of the latest information tools, it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the observators are using such systems.
The service providers and applications for the assessment of accidents and arrangements collect the information received by the manufacturers to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain Audatex, part of the Solera Group, is the market leader; 80% of all views are made with their products.
The two other companies who are competiting with the Tool Market for Review and Manufacture of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturer is not easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the seller of Audatex, is associated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them provides the information in another format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be edited will always be more gross until the point that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engineering came on the market than in the entire five years ago.
Once a new car comes on the market, the company starts working.
It is a pleasant task, because each of the thousands of vehicles must be catabolised and entered in its price.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" game that can "click" on various parts of the vehicle.
If this is a very broken model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is quite forward.
If this is a less usual car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently Audatex is 99.2% of the cars broadcast in Spain for full information.
In the exclusive models, for example, they have information about porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
As regards the vehicle park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
For the implementation of documentation works and for the production of databases, Audatex has been distributed over eight worldwide (Spania, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has been specialized on certain marks.
The national main seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There works more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, they receive 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this enormous information flow allows companies to use them in different ways and to offer different products.
The most common use is the use of reparations and arrangements, but there is also a tool to manage parts of a car in the country or to deal with the error or operational value of a car.
The only company that is informed of a leader who informs the value of the cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this boat in Spain, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide a review of the type of support that it gives to the branch experts.
This company offers various tools, whereas the star of the AudaPlus products is, a standard solution to the use of accidents for the observators.
It includes vehicles, engines and easily and severe industrial vehicles.
The costs for the parts include the repair periods estimated by the manufacturer or the lacking prices.
This toilet will be paid after use, i.e. for each observation.
In the most important case, it will be used for customers who rarely use it, mostly times a month, 5.75 euros per month.
