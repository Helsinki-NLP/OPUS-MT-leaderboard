Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Price of Peace
The American President Barack Obama will go to Oslo in Norway, to pass 26 hours there, and to be the fourth American President of the history to receive Nobel peace price.
The diploma, the medal and the cheque of 1.4 million dollars will be given to him for its exceptional efforts to strengthen the global diplomacy and the nationalization.
The Chief of the White House and his wife, Michelle, will arrive in the Norwegian Metropole morning and will have a program loaded.
It will be awarded to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet the five members of the Committee who chose it in October between 172 and 33 organizations for the first time.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and the Queen Sonja.
The visit will find its sum in the afternoon at a solar ceremonie where Obama will receive the prestigious ree.
It will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third will find out the price in the committee.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about war in Afghanistan when the price was released.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this price by being a president in two countries today.
He strengthened the efforts of war a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which will not be forgotten to underline.
During the ceremonie, Obama will also receive a golden medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 1.1 million euros).
It has not yet decided concretely to give gifts to benefits.
His programme will then carry on the envelope, as well as his wife to a banket, including the king and the Queen of Norway, the Government head and 250 other invited.
Obama was rather retitant to this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all who defend the same values as he.
From the announcement, he said that it would be a "invitation to act".

The waste sorting goods are not in the perfume in Brno
In Prague, everyone can sort his drinking packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on triggers at each road corner.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before finding the appropriate goods.
I don't mean we wouldn't trigger all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal advisers of our city, the second largest city of the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is the age of stone of the sort of waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially the number of goods assigned to these waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all a science, which is especially the time and the steel nerves.
The only place I found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Popeena Husa.
That Mr. Underka and his neighbors don't see me, but that's a little bit to me.
Without talking about the fact that in other quarters of the city, this is not a noise.
So to end, many of my friends do not trie their waste.
By the parse.
It makes them a throat to reach the bones.
It's not surprising me from them.
I, after a party, proposed to go to cast a few glass and PVC bottles.
Except that I have not seen any color cotton rue Kounicova.
Happy I found the appropriate place by going to take the tram.
This says, waste waste waste waste.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to represent the best city, right?
It is probably not too much interest in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hokey ligue that makes the city shame in the whole country, rather than buying some additional goods and offering a number of more materials for a more cleaner Brno.
I'm glad that I could comfort my impression with official statistics after having spent a time on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM's data, Brno is actually the worst in the South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has removed retraite money and disease congestion
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the Government, agricultors or even officers, it may have lack of money for traits, sickness congestion or stocks in the campaign.
But also for interests on State debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, states the Minister for Finance Eduard Janota.
When the social-democracy and the Others imposed the employment for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the Government would make loans for sensitive expenditures, retirements or diseases. "This is only to resume the problems later, mining the land," Janota said.
It is necessary to know that on the money loans the interests to be paid are more high and that it must be returned soon or later.
The State doesn't really have the choice to know where to get money.
If he does not reduce social aid or expenditure, he will have to increase taxes.
All who are currently increasing in the left: pompers, institutions, agricultors.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and don't be afraid of their retirements or illness insurance, whereas 1.8 billion have disappeared.
However, the costs of a larger end-up of the State - the next year will not miss 163 billion in the boxes, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus increase faster and with it, the costs related to interests.
The State will need money to repay it and it will no longer be sufficient to acquire the VAT or to reduce the maternity conge, as the government did in its antideficit package.
It will also miss five billion to purchase the buildings of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of electors.
This is primarily the case of already determined and initiated contracts which projects are not possible to reduce costs.
In addition, keep them, which is not even free.
This means delaying or stoping thirty large chambers, and the European funds are also in danger, guarding Karel Hanzelka, a port-word of the Ministry of Transport.
The CHSSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very properly - it will be able in the dividends of the CHEZ (foreigner and distributor of electricity), which the State has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case of an unfunded puzzle.
Last year, 18 billion have been navigated from the CEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay the removal of EEC deficits, completion of the retraits accounts, or still serve as a reserve for the reform of the prepared retraits.
Furthermore, this advice increases the actual deficit of the budget by 5.7 per cent of the PNB. EU rules.
And it's far to be the end of the carnaval of transfers.
The budget for various damage to the victims of communism and crimes, even the apartments of the campaign, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not sure that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose a international procedure, we must pay it anyway, Janota states.
The Minister will then have to economy from the department or, in the worst cases, to touch the government's budgetary reserve.
It also lacks hundred million in the draft state box of a value of two billion, which must allow to follow the costs of each administration online.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister for Finance did not find money else, the project should be stopped and the sanctions would have occurred, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, the Americans consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to move from a exploitation system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem to be promising.
It provides a button and you pass Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the objective of the American VMware society, which is mainly occupied with the development of computeralisation software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, Mr. Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone allocation doesn't take any effect from the fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800× with a 128 MB memory, which simultaneously exhibited the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of news for mobile phones is in full.
The VMware company is now with European and American operators to test smartphone analysis, and customers should have access to core equipment 2012.
Mount snow penetrates the hotels
Deserted tracks are not only difficult for the rebound-pents operators.
The lack of snow dissuades people to reserve their stays at ski in hotels and pensions.
In that fact, it is always possible to dismiss free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits on our site.
The internautes park the offers, ask for prices, but do not be committed to reservation for the time.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or bottle at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operating from Spindl.Info information portal.
If we want to pass the New Year of his dreams to Spindlerov Mlýn, it is better not too hester to book.
If the economy's priority is given and the quality of the accommodation only comes up, we can try to wait for a few days.
Spindler's hotels offer only a week's stay for the New Year.
I think they will try a while again to put them, but they will also fall down and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura assumed.
The tourism Agency Ingtours of Vrchlabi also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Week of Christmas is most interested in us for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared a few stays from Christmas last minute less dear," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism Agency of Vrchlabi may also offer the New Year in Krkonosse, but there are fewer free places.
Fév's first 14 days also go, and the remaining winter residences are selling by means.
This year, the interest in winter residences was negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonosse.
People's waiting for her to fall.
No one wants the winter to the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," she thinks.
Instead, the occupation of the Horizon hotel at Pec pod Snežku is higher than last year.
We have an improvement of approximately five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of January of the Poland and Fév日 also sells well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking of Janské Láznie is also full of four and twenty percent during the New Year period.
Instead, half of the beds remains empty at Christmas in the recent hotel of Janské Lázní.
This year we were welcomed by the month of January, where we have already seventy percent of employment at the present time.
Fév_ is a little smaller for the instant but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in residents in the Krkonosse will grow, certainly, has indicated the director of Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonosse's hotels should not expect more snow.
Thursday, it will make more costs and if there are precepts, they should be snow in the mountain.
However, afterwards, the time should be retreated, Jiří Jakubsky reported about the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometheological Institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even comic, the efforts that Barack Obama, president of the wise reputation, repeated the strategy of his president on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered very simple.
When he ended with allowing his warmly expected doctrine to transpire, it appeared that he had copied it to carbon paper since the Iraqian Bush scenario three years ago.
No pleasure to use the expression "like in Iraq" in the same text several times, it has not been disappointed, which is more than, to use the title of the Bush talk in January 2007 as a title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new strengths to a Iraq consumed by civil war as "unresponsibility and a disaster decision in its consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was recommended by campaign commanders, was the only possible and possible success that the newspapers currently do not speak about the whole of Iraq.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, which, objectively speaking, left his follower a much more favorable final situation than we could not expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will be reproduced
These are again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military quota, including the commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the reticences of the White House despite subordination habits.
He requested 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The Chairman has been disappointed for three months but without a better option, he has at least broke the General of 10 000 soldiers.
It has succeeded in eliminating the promise of 5 000 additional from Europe, even if it was 10 000 from origin.
The most problems of Obama's strategy seem to be its intention to restore Afghanistan's armies from 18 months and complete this process of three years.
Many doubt that half increase will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite fragile wars in recent years, the Iraqian society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghanistan situation is in the opposite way - nobody can be counted and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghanistan security forces, used to change the day leader's ways.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only be pulled in the eyes of which the patriarchal ethnic relations will be extended.
It is very complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups having regard to the lack of clarity of reports, which are still complicated by Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "speed to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, is not very real.
The timezone of the Obama strategy makes it perplexed by its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only empired and is currently at the border of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and outside the reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war in order to bring their "fast return to the house" a real miracle there.
From a political point, definition of a date for the return of troops is clearly irresponsible, since the Talibans will consider it as the indirect injury of the American defect.
The latest summary of the NATO showed that the Europeans' will to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is a negative point.
European policies do not know nor want to explain to their electors how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush Mountains.
Another factor that can radically improve the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to disappoint and that strengthened sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a solution to the problem by relief to military force.
For example, it will be necessary to answer at the time when Obama will come to the winners of Afghanistan.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic return of the Afghanistan situation.
The only rusty for Obama is the fact that there remains three years until the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to plan on a new strategy, where it would be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs' bank leaders will not receive liquid money premies anymore
High leaders of the US Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive this year of prize in species.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms on its salary practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive action instead of money, which they will not be able to sell before five years.
Actions may be returned to the leaders if they would take too many risks.
According to Re日s, Goldman Sachs is headed for the effort to connect payments to long-term performance at Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that you have to take, indicated the old ban of investments of Douglas Elliott from JPMorgan.
The worry is in the details, he's got.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the critical objective after it has been put on the side of almost 17 billion dollars for premies on the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of the premies will probably exceed $20 billion, despite the current year's measurement, the Agency Re ·s.
With the array of the financial crisis, the strong primes of the sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Great Britain announced on Wednesday that it was expected to affect a single tax of fifty per cent of the bonuses of the bans exceeding 25,000 livres.
France prepares similar measures.
This year women received Nobel prices in all areas other than the
These are five women, a record number, who have received today in Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave Nobel prices in technical and literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German Herta M.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received the Nobel Medical Price for their research in the field of Chromosomes.
The chemical price was determined to the israelian Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of the ribosomes
The last laureate received the Nobel economy price, the American Elinor Ostrom with his companion Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of the economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have praise this year was the.
This price was given today to the scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George ́ith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD puces, which are currently based on all digital, fax, or astronomical cameras.
Each laureat received the diploma, Nobel medal and the acquisition certificate.
This reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them bears a number of lowers, they will share the reaction between them.
The very expected Nobel price of peace has already been sent to Oslo this afternoon to the American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy nature of his resources because it is only at the beginning of his parkings and that he is also head of a country involved in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of its policy, he said that in some situations war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota intended to dismiss. Klaus invited him to Casteau
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister for Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, which will put its residence to the Government because of its disagreement with the State budget for the next year as it was voted by the House of Members
The budget and may also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be considered on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of financial funds.
This is the Chairman Radim Ochvat's password who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation which will be subject to the signing of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should handle.
However, the House of Members validated the proposals on the left and increased the payments of officers, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of the social democracy that they would indirectly increase the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left of one side, the Government, Klaus and the right of the other side, which makes the future of the Fischer Cabinet, which had been made by agreement between the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party.
Criticals claim that the budget, as was voted by the Members, removes the package of economy measures made by the Government of Fischer, which must enrich the detention of the State.
Klaus, who can comply with the law on the State budget but which does not oblige it, has stated today at a little breakfast of discussions with undertakers, that politics have long disappeared the "serious problem" of the "unrefriendable deficiency" of financials.
Now there is no favourable solution to him.
Only a strong government could make a improvement, if it could support a consensus of the larger political parties, the President.
The President of ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is exhaustive and that the Government should submit its later existence.
The President of the ODS Petr Netemp told the CTK that the idea of a administrative cabinet supported by the CHSSD, the ODS and the Verts is no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer qualified such words of "drastic verdicts".
The Chief of the CHSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is exhausted and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday, the CSSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new movie of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticisms that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will expose many things to the world about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, a re-American actor in Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, incredible fighting the racist system of the apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that he was a 14-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The sixty-two years old actor who has been renewed by a price for his role in the drame Million_Baby of Clint Eastwood in the middle of the box has, for example, encouraged the leader of a movement against slaveship became a slave himself, a ficticious president of the United States, even God in the Evan All-powerful movie, but never a living and so important person as the east of Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was arrested for 27 years for his work in favour of the end of the apartment in South Africa.
It was released free in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was determined the Nobel Price of Peace.
Invictus is an Invictus Latin word meaning invigu and it is the title of a poema of the author William Ernest Henley in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film ra_ the real history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the Captain of the South African rugby team of France to unify the country. The president Mandela newly chosen knows that his country remains and is always rationally divorced and economically after the apartheid.
He is convinced that he can join his people by sport and decide to join the rugby players who are among the outsides of the world range.
The South African team will end by progressing in the World Coupe in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on a large ́ran.
I had no other goal other than to play this role in making it closer to the most reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be in couchs before his speech.
The most important for him was to shut his hand.
I realized that when I put your hand on you, I get your energy, she's transferred, and I've been impressed to know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the François Pinaire movie, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are most white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Piner at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Piнер was: "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus has received positive opinions under the Eastwood realizer's hole, and even ambitions are discussed for Oscars.
The Todd McCarthy movie criticism of the Daily Variety journal resumed its appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good film."
In film evaluations on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive appreciations.
The mystery of aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians tested a fuse
A strange phenomenon of origin that was not known above Norway was observed.
The Russian Defence Department has only recognized that there has been a test of a intercontinental ballistic zone that is not far from Norwegian borders.
However, the launch has still been a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which had to be the proud of the Russian army, gradually became the cauchemar of the Russian Generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the fuses tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava wasn't wounded, or she was hurt in full flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but who does
This 13th test was normal at the beginning.
It's only at the end of the flight that there's again defects on the apparatus.
It is obviously the engine of the third stage of the fusy that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" was surrounded by the nuclear submarine Dmitri Donskij, which was bound under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be burned by a movement and split
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flighting object that was not identified exactly was likely by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt that it was a Russian zone.
The generals argue that this time, we can't speak absolutely of failure.
The two first stages of the fusy have resisted and the avariah has only touched the third.
In some cases, engines have experienced deficiencies on the first stage.
Although no of the tests has been launched without acrocs, the Defence Minister's direction considers that only six over thirteen has failed.
This rate of success of almost 50 percent therefore uses optimism generals, and they always claim that a day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersensitive nuclear novels of a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
General Fetissov signed at 51 years a year contract with the CSKA Moscou
The Defensor-General Viatcheslav Fetissov will be presented again in a 51-year professional match.
The old world champion, olympical champion and the holder of Stanley Cup will make his CSKA Moscou team firm in need and will probably make it in on Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at 40 years in 1998, is for the time the President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's wound, we need a different defendant.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We need to set a few details on the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP Agency.
It has not been specified if the comback of the hokey player will only affect one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian hokey professional player.
In NHL, Gordie Howe attacked a whole season for Hartford and received 15 targets and 26 assistants.
The elderly five Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hokey players and among those who have the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he broke the gold twice in the Olympics Games, seven of the world's champion titles, triomphed in the Canada Cup and the World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected the homages in NHL where he had Stanley Cup two times.
He is a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the syndicates and cancels every additional hour
The Hyundai company's direction of Nošo's was agreed with the syndicates to have every additional hour.
It is just because of the frequent additional hours that the syndicates have declared an emergency state on Monday.
The port-passphrase Peter Vanek of Hyundai's company confirmed it.
However, the direction wants to continue to agree with the syndicates on a weekly worked this year yet.
We can't reject our production plan, it's essential, so that additional hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, says Vanek.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to the salaries that would be part of the Sabbath team.
It will also be assigned post‐ri for the working day on 28 November.
The company, Vanek, decided to change the way to motivate its salaries in exchange of additional hours.
Or they receive the addition for more hours, or they can put a replacement conjunction on December 28, and thus extend their end-year feasts in Vanek.
Furthermore, all the salaries present on Saturday will receive a compensation for transport costs and for breakfast.
Since the additional hours were the most urgent and heavy point in comments and complaints of syndicates as the salaries who spontaneously ceased production last week, the direction took the immediate decision to make every additional hour for December, stated Vanek.
To the last week, car rentals were forced to work nearly daily two additional hours in more than eight hours.
Syndicates have the state of green after signing the agreement.
The following negotiation between the car engine and the syndicates must take place on Friday afternoon.
The syndical leader Peter Kuchař stated Wednesday that they were willing to stop the state of greve in case of agreement on their complaints and signature of a common document.
The situation in the company was the last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously incurred due to incoming hours.
They also protested against bad conditions of salary and prejudice.
The direction was defensed by the additional workshops in order to comply with auto-production imprisonment.
During the announcement of Monday Greece, the syndicates also asked that the salaries who had ceased the production would not be subject to any sanctions.
Syndicates request the company to reduce the past time in additional hours.
Moreover, they want this year a refund of 5 000 corners (209 €) for these.
The Hyundai's car engine of Nošo is currently employed by 2 000 people.
It started the production in series last year in November.
It produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV "during" viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow up the proliferation of HIV virus in the area.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses who have already developed immunity for medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes the above of the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the core variants of virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of patients is radically prolonged by a mixing of medicines that prevent HIV-virus multiplication in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of secondary effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the development of what is called resident viruss on which medicines no longer have effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the Czech Republic's Scientific Academy, the VHCHT of Prague and the Heidelberg University opens the way to face virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metalocarbons are acting on the protein responsible for HIV virus multiplication.
Metacarbons are a assembly of beer, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way of all medicines used up to now and therefore they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers led them to discover new "bettered" substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links on virus proteins.
Metalcocarbons have a unique tridimensional structure: two multi-paroy boxes are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atomes and connected with a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV-virus protein that is essential to the virus life cycle.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would not be any infectionate particulates of the virus.
If you stop HIV protease, you will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explaining researchers in a pressed chemical and biochemical Institute of the Czech Republic of Science Academy.
In their works in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two cages couples are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematic.
A little lower but more reliable.
The efficiency of this series of substances on HIV protease has been tested in tests as well as in resistent variants, obtained in patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of enzyme, the efficacy of metalcarbons is not as strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not fascinate the resisting versions against which the core medicines are often ineffective.
Metalcocarbons, with their unique action mechanism and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and other chemical changes, therefore, are interesting combinations to examine more to address the development of effective medicines against HIV, Pavlína Reezáčová, director of the organic and biochimic Institute's organic chemical laboratorium and the molecular genetic Institute of Science Academy.
Deputy around the budget. The ODS takes it to Fischer, who is defending
The President of the ODS (Democrate Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek qualified for the budget for the next year, and it should be the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
The Prime Minister qualified the issues of the drastic verdict ODS.
He says to take time to analyze.
The portfolio of the ODS Petr Netid stated that the idea of a administrative cabinet supported by the CHSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was no longer working.
According to Netime, the Governing Boss should decide to take aside the House of Members supported for the minority that concerns fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in his functions with the support of the parliamentary left.
It was not timely warned that the positions of the ODS and the social democracy in relation to the problem of public deficits were diameterly opposed.
The Chamber of Members held the budget for the year 2010 on Thursday, however, the proposals for 12 billion amendments included by the left.
The Chamber increased the money for employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's influence on the proposals of the social democracy was the fact that they indirectly increased the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should handle a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obedient to the Government's desire as a budget is a less bad variety than an interim budget.
Deception and uselessness
The Minister for Finance Eduard Janota spoke of deception and a feeling of unnecessaryness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government would still reflect on the current situation.
It is not timely convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his functions in case of ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took a meeting on Monday with the Prime Minister after it had passed to the Government:
He pointed out at the same time as he asked whether he would stay in his functions.
Its deception on negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budgetary deficit, Netime considers that the representatives of the CSSD, who have made the changes in the budget, have no place in the Government.
The Prime Minister should also say strictly that he will be dismissed if the Chamber has the other laws that increase deficit, such as those that affect disease insurance, retraits, or reform of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not concerned.
This is the case of the leader of the Government of Fischer and of the whole government.
The Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing to be prejudiceable, and Topolánek emphasized in a textual statement from the United States.
He reminded that the ministers of some ministers claimed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He noticed that if Fischer decides to give his demission to combat the deficit of financial deficiencies, " it is in fact logical and right that it is based on the left majority currently in the Room. "
This states that it should not expect the support and tolerance of democracy.
I didn't think about it and when it's on the agenda of the day, I'll dedicate it, the journalists, Martin Barták Minister of Defence, chosen to the government just by democracy.
The Prime Minister Fischer went on the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went back to the request of the Prime Minister.
It was not time to emphasize that the ODS would probably vote on Wednesday against the budget if it had not expressly requested the Democratic Members to allow the vote of the budget.
We have no sense of being orphans, we are not small children, did he respond to the question of whether the ODS had not committed advice from the President of the Party to the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I had already known at the time I rejected my mandate that the following months would be a bolchevising of the Room and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new times of the CD, there will be less trains for identical tariffs.
Czech railways will be removed or limited from December 13, and will strengthen some of the other trains expressly or regionally less loaded.
The total coverage of transports will be decreased on the day of entry into force by two percent new hours compared to today.
Most of the tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
These are for example the people of the Ostrava region who will have more links to capital, the railways will raise a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, a expression will stop deserving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line of Prague - Písek - Češka Bu日, the direct line of Prague - Letohrad will be radially reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transports relates to the region of Hradec Králové of eight percent to the total, however, the Prague and its environments can be increased.
Two night trains on the line of Prague - Tabor - Češka Bu日 also are cancelled and the release of some trains expressed on the line Prague - Písek - Češka Bu月o will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the largest transformations, you can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milo in Prague: for the moment, the inhabitants of Milo must change to Lysá na Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko bath system, which is possible by the end of the line between Lysá na Labem and Milo.
Distance lines to capital will have their final destination at the main garage of Prague (Praha Hla · nadraží).
The CHD will introduce more SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains at the destination of Shumperk/Jesenic will leave for two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The facture for regional railways this year: 200 million additional corners.
Express trains are commanded and paid by the Ministry of Transports and will pay to the iron roads for the next year in all four billion corners to fix losses, or the same amount as this year. Regional trains are commanded by the regions paying for them for a total of eight billion per year, knowing that the State will participate at almost three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million more dear.
The railways again signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still a year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not increased the large majority of transport licences.
The changes will only affect the billets of a day CHD Net and the eLiška lower-price internet billets.
For travelers without decreasing card, the price of CHD Net will increase from 450 to 600 corners.
The eLiška price will again depend on the parking travel, while it was valid between cities of a region at the election and was at a unique tariff of 160 corners.

The history of South Africa relates to everyone, Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in the American rooms in the next days, the title is Invictus (the official title is Invictus: Neporajení), and tells a part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the worldwide apartheid has come back to Morgan Freeman, which has been chosen for years ago by Mandela himself to encarce it.
The second male role of the South African campaign of rugby was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the array of the film in rooms, the returns of critics and publics are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the price of Sakharov for his spirit freedom, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace price by Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full prepared for the football world's cut, and on the other hand because the media are acted by new concerns about the ability of racial conflicts and discrimination of people from the black majority to power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new movie are for the moment very positive in South Africa, despite the common reserves issued to the main roles in "pavaning" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of his own terms.
I dreamed of this role for many years, and I was well prepared.
I also met personally Nelson Mandela for power - as it is said - to recover from its energy, did he indicate at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that is a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember the personality and the message of Mandela through the film.
This is the history of the South African Republic, but it relates to each person who has reacted.
Get the maillot of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of the British Roman John Carlin is the title freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part that gave its creation to the people describe the South African defendant of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Thus, during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to collect two racial groups of a long-term population, as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was in the middle of the national maillot of the South African team on the pool of the world's cut, which South Africa had received then.
To be shown on the maillot puzzle, which is considered to be something sacred in South Africa, Mandela was long ovationed for 14 years ago of the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Let us hope that the football championship will succeed to join people again in one nation, indicated the rugby Chester Williams player, who was the only "swart" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see whether the southern African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are skeptic as recently relied in a maintenance for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Great Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A valuable transformer of tens of millions of flame crowns in the Louny region
An incendie included the morning a transformer of the Cheps company of the distribution center near the community of Výškov in Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the port-password of the pumps of Usti, there are six units that operate on the burning.
They accounted for the origin of allowing the transformator to consume, but they renewed their opinions and extinguished the burning with a mixture of water, mouse and a special substance.
The cause is a technical failure, a short-circle of the transformator.
No one has been hurt and the Pavla Mandátova's password is not risking the security operation of the transmission engine.
The damage is estimated at a few decades of million crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is exhausted.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformator must be replaced by a nine.
It is only that in ten years of activity, the Cheps company did not know anything similar and that the incidents of this type were isolated.
The provisions by electric currency have not been interrupted, states the Portal of the CHEZ company for the North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the function of houses, administrations and industry has not been affected by the incendie of the transformation station.
A.s. Cheps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission engines and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformators transporting electricity from transport engines to distribution engines and line traces of 4339 km length.
Jančura will bring complaints for diffamation against three prefects of the CHSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will present a complaint for diffamation against three democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hashek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomo region Martin Tesarek.
Janchura indicated it in Dvacet minute of radiojournal.
The complaint is linked to the attempt of the company to explore regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have been completed by signing long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we were doing fine mouths, while we did only one offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more dear than the Czech Iron Roads what is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Iron Roads which have been signed last week.
So there's nothing left for us but to defend us.
This is in exchange of catastrophes on the Student Agency company, Jančura said in the Radiojurnal.
Similarly, it indicated that there were evidence that no region had been in accordance with European law.
We will prepare for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hashek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint deposit represents the suite of its median spectacle that serves him free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am sure ready to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I guess this will be the opportunity to show that it is just Mr Jančura who manipulates the opinion and brings false and false arguments on regional railway transport, says Hashek.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in a publicity that will mention the defavorable approaches of the regions.
He stated to Radiojurnal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and accounted for it after the New Year.
He pointed out that the campaign would show corruption in the wide sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to grant the Czech Iron Roads the operation of railway links for a order of approximately 150 billion crowns, without calling for offers.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of railway transport in the regions even brought threats to Jančura by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we would not stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I don't know what it is but I won't say his name, said Jančura in Radiojurnal today.
Vacuation against pneumocs will be free and facultative
Vacuation against pneumocs will reduce old habits since January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time facultative for families.
The votes are already voting, saying that a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococks are colminated.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines to pay disease insurance.
Specialists also see it in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for Ao's children.
Since January, children born last year from 2 Ao日 can be vaccinated freely against pneumococks.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If the vaccination has been started last or earlier year, the following vaccinations must be paid themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, a fourth of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumocoques.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns and even more for one dose.
The vaccination of the younger is four doses again.
Specialists believe that sickness insurance costs 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses each year.
However, they economy on medical cares that un vaccinated children would need.
Until now, the State spent approximately 500 000 crowns per year for all children's vaccination.
Rebound vaccination was introduced with the "Janota" package.
Pneumocoques are the cause of average ear inflammations but also serious infections such as inflammation of blood inflammations.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children less than 10 years caused by pneumocoque infections.
Besides the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and facultative.
For example, the President of Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský pointed out that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
It has long promoted vaccination against pneumocs.
In a international conference to which we participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a facultative vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think that this is a direction that is needed to follow now, said Kalovski.
But the Ministry of Health does not want the vaccination process against pneumocoques.
We do not consider it absolutely for the moment, stated its Vlastimil Srszeň's password.
The facultative vaccination has its inconvenients, physicians say.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Specialized Pediatric Society, recognises that a vaccination based on voluntariata is its failures.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease of vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the facultative vaccination," however, Cabrnochová said.
Specialists provide that since the next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccine their food.
The vaccination against pneumocs also indicates a breakdown because it is the first vaccination of children financed by insurance and not by State.
Cabrnochova explains that insurance should be released from prevention funds, so they would economy on future medical care.
The doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, related to the concerns of practical childhoods, relating to the purchase of vaccines.
The original purpose was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow the assurances to "reduce the amounts of disease insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and expect the insurance to restore them.
According to estimates, children will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccine, which is a significant sum.
It'll be far away from being easy, Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a Museum Vol
The son of Frank Frazetta, a recognised illustrator, was accused to try to steal tables for a value of 20 million dollars (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interpelled when he loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and in a remorque.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the input of the museum in the region of Pocono Mountains.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, age of 81, is famous for its designs of personalities such as Conan the Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the accident, the artist was in Florida, reported the press agency Press (AP).
AP cited a police responsibility, which Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family wedding.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, has been authorised by his father to "come into the museum by any means to transport tables into a storage installation", reported the Agency.
Mr Frazetta Senior had no such authorisation, said the Agency.
The Labor defends the budgetary taxation.
The Ministers defended the tax reduction and reduction of the annual expenditure in the Prebudget report, despite the criticism of opposition, business and syndicates.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling was missing an opportunity to show that he was serious about deficit reduction by reporting his decisions to the elections.
The Chanceller also attached the football by joining the lower salaries and the average salaries.
Among its main proposals, there is an increase of 0.5% of the Social Insurance and a level of 1% on public salaries since 2011.
The wrath of the Social Insurance
The syndicates protested that the low salaries were penalized by a recession which they were not responsible and watched that "problems" were announced.
The decrease of social insurance - which will allow approximately 3 billion GBPs per year - has wrathed the world of businesses, because it is a tax on employment while the goal should be a restoration of the economy.
The reservation for those who win more than 200,000 GBP per year will touch about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINT OF THE PREBUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
Economy will decrease more than 4.75% expected this year
New rate of 50% on bank bonuses
The increase in the tax on the benefits of the company for small companies has been abandoned
Rabs of electrical and electrical car taxes
Increase of retirements by 2.5%
According to the Treasur's estimates, a person wining 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person wining 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person wining 10,000 GBP per year will win 110 GBP more.
The Ministers said that their goal to reduce half deficit before 2013 would lead to " difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the first 5% of the loans.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in tax and highlighted that a decrease in expenditure was a "bottle of water in the ocean" compared to what was necessary.
"These numbers are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential during the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would be reduced at the end of the year.
However, the Labor's previsions regarding economic growth - which will affect the amount he needs to empowere and the speed to which the deficit will be complicated - were doubted after the Chanceler had been required to revise its first numbers.
In his allocation, he said that the economy would probably be decreased by 4.75% this year - worse than the decline of 3.5% proposed in April - while the debt would be 3 billion BDP above the pre-estimated estimation.
"Lack of opportunity"
The Conservators who will launch a new advertising campaign against Labour's "debt crisis" on Wednesday claimed that the project of 789 billion GBP was not sustainable during the next six years.
Ministers did not present a reliable plan on how to restore, have they chosen, "chinically" of difficult choices until the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They had nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, the Secretary of the Fancy Cabinet's Treasure. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The important announcements will be made after elections, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labor insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the following reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and more important deficit reduction.
However, the Lib Dems claimed that the money recovered by taxing and reduction of expenditure would be used to support the expenditure of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, supporting that the plans were "constructed on wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's Political Editor, said that the calendar of announcements - such as the inflation for certain invalidity performances in April, mentioned above, would leave the Chanceler with propaganda, just recovered the following year.
However, the Labour insists that additional aid is offered while people are most needed and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Fal budget"
Although the Ministers did not have the expenditure details beyond 2011, the economys claimed that it was aware that the cost restrictions would start to feel a middle-term only.
The very respected Institute for Fiscalées (Institut of Fiscal Studies) claimed that Chanceller's numbers include substantive reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defense.
"The pain is in fact not only reported," said her doctor, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after elections, whatever the winner," Roger Bootle, economic adviser at Deloitte accounts, said.
"This was a fake pre-budget report, and markets are well informed about it."
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest, in Pakistan, of five American reporters, suspicious of extreme links.
The men were arrested at a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the east province of Punjab, announced the American ambassador in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI said he was asking to know whether they were the same men who had been declared dismissed from their home in the American State of Virginia last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he also searched for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as a Pakistanian ascension, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Jemenite.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what faces they face and in what conditions they are detained," Ian Kelly's password said.
Katherine Schweit, FBI's password, stated that the Agency had known arrests and that she was in contact with the families of disappeared students.
"We are with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are actually the students who have been brought away," she said.
Pakistan's ambassador in Washington stated that men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said that the house was already overseen by the local police and that no one has yet been brought against the arrested men.
The State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, reported to the press agency, but said that the United States had "cooperated more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to deal with the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were removed from their home by their families, in Virginia of the North, the end of November.
Amnesty condemns the Iranian "abus"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been so shortly respected as never, the report of Amnesty International.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the presidential elections of June.
A man cited in the report said that he had been burned and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he had been threatened by violence.
Iran denied the criticisms in respect of his non-respect of human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after the vote of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to the greatest manifestations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Twelve were sentenced to prison penalties and the prosecutors claimed that at least five were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, corresponding to the BBC in Teheran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has recognised some abuse claims, ordering the closure of the detention centre of Kahrizak.
However, since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"Fusse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "Tâiler with Facebook networks" and protested against the results of the election.
"They often struck me in the face," it was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... they threatened to exhibit me and humble me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In age, Mehdi Karroubi's election candidate for the elections claimed that manifestants arrested after election were tortured to death in prison and that others were violated.
The Iranian authorities rejected violations, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also quoted the case of an ancient prisoner who said had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the Judicial Agency were creating a committee to investigate after election and the response of the Government, but she said that the mandate and powers of these agencies were not worth and that the results of the Parliamentary Committee were not public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent other manifestations.
Ski tracks built in the town park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a trace for competitions.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) has attached 16 semi-professional snowboarders in competition for prices in speed.
On the top of the Brandon Hill park, a small tremplin was a 100m long track.
John Hickman, studying in the fourth year of doctors, said that the high view of the track was great but that it was quite intimidant.
It's a beautiful view, with all the lights of the town that strikes in contrabas.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he said.
Prices have reactivated the best voltings - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday evening, the snow will be left to the source.

Is it possible to be French?
Pluralism and pragmaticism in a Lake State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirators of the last book of the author, "Why the French don't love the foulard" (2006), a legitimate and well documented study on a problem that has divorced and worryed the country for fifty years and whose effects still feel today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a much larger and more ambitious trame.
Good anthropologue, he wants not only to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the Mosquees, Schools and Institutes that now provide in France, which Bozen calls "musulman spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very well able to listen to and reproduce the discussions between teachers and teachers on questions that are most related to them.
Should a musulman marry in a mosque or mairi (or both)?
Should the development and rights of homosexual people be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-muslim?
Can a musulman use a business system based on interests for a loan?
This is the practical issues, he states, which are the daily lot, rather than the political drames that concern media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all inconque of the great public, other than Tariq Ramadan, a Arab muslim who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good muslim and a good citizen in a modern Law society.
They don't move the debate to the end.
Conservators do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are usually in line with their approved lawyers of a purist Sunni islam associated with Saudi Arabia who are today a small part of the European Muslims.
M Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the flexibility of the French would be compatible.
But a compromise can only be obtained with each camp's efforts.
It wonders how the French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite of laicity) are actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims have not been punished, compared to Catholics, Protestants and ́s who have also had historical compromises with the Lac Republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "heavyness of key values".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, we are trying to say "yes, but not yet."
The Darkest View of the World
Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that is composing it is coming to a alarming speed, bringing with her a life that can't survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions, and fishing ships in new open waters, with diplomates, lawyers and now writers in their sillage.
In "There is a ice bed", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, draws a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polyar orchard.
Knower of the history and complex fishing policies at the whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorators who proved to catch the white orchard.
The meeting of Amiral Nelson, then aspiring courageous 14 years of age that was only the point of his mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young orsons, captured while they naked near their mother, just killed, were captured and sent into zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 ours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a million of the surface needed for a adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a pool weight living in Singapore has become green because of the alges that put into his spacious floor.
Here for more information!
Mr. Ellis raة the stories of other writers and historians and often come back to the threat that the jagers constitute on the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter chaters and Motoroski Indians use powerful fusilsd asylums to hunt their gibier.
Ironically, it is in the northern waters of these two nations of jail that the ice will remain as long as possible.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a summary and fearing the science of the Ark and a predicting what may be the future there.
Not that scientists had all the answers.
Atmospherists or oceanographics can not relate exactly to the speed of changes.
It's not wrong to try.
End 19th and beginning 20th, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer travellers provided the first information on the source of ice calotte.
The submarines of the cold war later cartographed the changes in relief under-cell.
The satellite monitoring and iceberg sonds are of great aid, but the biggest of the work is made by endured men camping in cold.
Mr. Anderson contains the extraordinary and small world of the arctic ice ice system, formed by saumate water sticks pressed by geling.
But from the wear above the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the loss of the sea ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe our tour"
Marines, among the 6.000 people who put crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of De'Angello Robinson, 19, has made a bus travel of seven hours to put a simple coron on the grave of a soldier he never had met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, in North Caroline to Arlington National Cemetery to cover the graves, this day was dedicated to salute men and women who were at their place on one day.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we can be at their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that would be me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that's why I just try to show respect.
It was one of the 6.000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to put crowns on the fever tombs, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cimetary.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, started the memory and other people decided to cover hundreds of funerals in the Arlington Ceremony cimetery.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, standing in various cities on their road, to organize memories for the honor of military and terrorism victims.
The Worcesters also found a non-processive purpose, Wreaths Across America (Crons through America), which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the bursts of the Arlington cimeter, around Pentagon, on the tombs of the cimeter Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the Memorial for the victims of the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consular year, the Walmart Foundation foundation gave more than $150 000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington for her husband, a dead career military.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, that gesture was a way to thank those who were sacrificed.
It's a little gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emitted in several warm clothing beds, volunteers traveled between the pools and the expanded cimetry.
The volunteers have chosen old tombs from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not frequently visited as the new tombs, the organizers have declared.
The humor was at optimism, while the children played and the couple stood by the hand, with fresh pin corners on the grisen graves.
Each round corner had a flashed green color, with a small red node on the top.
Nearby, the silence was planned on Section 60, where most of the veterinarians of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhuman.
The United Service Organizations gave 1 000 crowns to cover the section, but the shadow shadow of current wars applied the area.
Individuals would weep without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in cold air.
Some read highly the names recorded in the stone while others dressed to see the small black and white information cards, found in the humid land for those who had not been completed the grave.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on his son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, in Ohio, and had spent eight hours to come to gather herself on the grave of the Sergeant of Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, dead in the fight in July.
No one should never forget what we are free... my son paid for that, she said.
"How long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A American citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government arrested a American citizen distributing mobile phones and phone computers in the country, confirmed the services of the American Foreign Minister.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based on Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The precise performances have not been made, although under Cubain law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be stopped under the pretext of being "hazard".
All revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graphs and talks are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bigger bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commenter who often writes about how they are husbands and she is monitored and arrested by government agents.
Sánchez requested several requests to leave the country to get resources, but authorisations have always been made.
The detention of a American citizen may increase the stress between the Government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a "mood" approach to improve the relationship with the island.
The arrest announcement was reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The New American Policy insists that the Cuban Government progress through concrete steps, such as release of political prisoners and make more space for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and mobile computers are allowed in Cuba, although new and desired consumption goods in a country or the average salary of a officer is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government has granted the citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxe hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in certain government immobilities, such as universities.
The Cubans who want to join themselves often have to give their name to the Government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of a American in Cuba is rare.
The most rare American prisoners in Cuba are behind the barriers for crimes such as drug traffic, Gloria Berbena, who is attracted to the U.S. Interests Section in La Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about arrest.
arrest and detention are a big mistake.
A activity that, in any other open company, would be authorised -- to distribute freely mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, the program manager of the United States Group of Human Rights Watch, which recently made a serious report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother.
According to Vivanco, a accused person is often arrested, passed in judgment and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to the United States, when both countries begin to promote a better dialogue.
Pakistan authorities prevent a complot to send men to Afghanistan
Samedi, the Pakistan authorities found an organization intended to prepare a complot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they would hope that this case would enable an important network of terrorist recluders that embrace the Internet for the search of young people radicalized.
Researchers claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent person, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments that approved the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site.
In Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the region recovered from Pakistan's tribe cinture, Al-Qaida's home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistan Secret Services, which was informed of the case, said Saturday that Saifullah was not able to convince the Al-Qaida commanders that these men did not participate in the complex of the dictionary to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they have been isolated for days in the East town of Sargodha, far from the north-east mountains, become a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself in the condition of maintaining anonymity because of the confidential character of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that men were determined and that they still tried the authorisations necessary to enter the camps of Al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistanian law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are asked by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruitors in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in determining people in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, American secret services have been prioritized to infiltrate men in the al-Qaida network.
The recruitors of the organization play the role of guards, which includes the entrance of those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analystes, American potential recrues are studied nearly by al-Qaida.
But they are very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American goals and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert of the United States NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups should also take more attention in the last years in the choice of people they accept because the American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way is it to follow his model of recruitment as many people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one who is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestants in Copenhagen request a "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of protestants walked in the streets, here on Saturday, seeking a more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Congress Palace of the Bella Convention Centre of the city.
The number of demonstrants was estimated to 100 000 people, more than 25,000 persons; police estimates.
This event was relatively peacefully developed, although a small number of masked activists had aligned a few explosives nearly one of the governmental immobilities in the center of the city.
On that day, when a little thing happened during the debates on the climate sponsorized by the United Nations, thousands of activists travelled from the city, spreading pancarts with "There is not a planet B" and a Spanish, saying "The Earth says it's enough."
Several collections joined protests, including the Danish top model and photograph, Helena Christiansen, who said to travel to his mother's country, Peru, opened his eyes on the declaring problems that the country must face because of the impact of the climate changes already occurred."
It is one of the reasons why I decided to join the big walk -- to make the word pass and start a call to the leaders of the world to make righteous, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not a easy job, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the manifestants from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 persons for the motive they had a mask or that they had a pocket.
The police prevented the manifestants from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 persons for the motive they had a mask or that they had a pocket.
According to a person who requested to maintain anonymity because of its implication in climate discussions, the activists who were carrying out the masks and clothing of black clothes have identified several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, around some ministers.
They launched them near the immortals, he said, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Inside the Congress Palace, people were gathered around television rains to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it is that manifestants have not been able to wake the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for climate.
When he was asked if he thought that a manifestation would have a positive impact on international debates, he replied, "In fact, that's something I didn't know.
Then he continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that walking could be low or useful for the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the large public and the various sectors on climate change, said he.
On the other hand, "You can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of tests reveal divorce between races
The Federal Report of the last week on Mathematical results has brought good news to the schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District remains far behind the heading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are increasingly progressed during the two years of the years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what results from the recent numbers of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Evaluation of Learning Progress) is the persistent art between the results of Africans and white Americans at both local and national levels.
The average results of white children in Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased from 262 to 270 during the last two years (at a scale of 500), but those of their African classmates have only increased from three points from 209 to 212.
The successful art has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Africans in Degree 8 (4th) remains usually consistent, only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of white was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The view of a six-year period is no more encouragement.
In 2003, the art between black and white in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP of the District report was held, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results of children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defensors in the District expressed anxiety that the increase collected by the group of educational institutions of Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democracy) was provoked by white students who had already been good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is difficult and genuine, said Jeff ́ith, D.C. Voce, a non-profit group that defends the equality in the education of the district.
I don't survive for one or two winned points, Kwame R. Brown (democrate appearance), member of the Council of D.C., whose girl is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (elementary oil).
Often critical to Rhee's management, Brown stated that the message of test results is that the middle schools (schools) in the city need deeply attention.
Actually, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what fears is that we don't have enough time and energy in our schools (schools).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, viewing schools of the end classs of the elementary cycle and starting employment that have not integrated the bases of reading before in their school parks and who are quite late in comparison with their friends.
Each day, the program of mathematics for childrengarten (maternal) classs at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on games and experiences in real life, such as those were placed in the District by the former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these level-level levels, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP are the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the general results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce art.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the Berkeley University in California, studying the results of the town tests.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest quarters of Washington.
This goal may also have political impacts that lead to this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as other Superintendents of schools, it is trying to use the average white and black class.
We are going to ensure the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our quarter schools so that all families, whateverwhere they are originating, will be assured that their children will be able to have a great education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce success art was the duration of the traditional oil, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with the Charter Schools.
Janey, who has agreed with his teachers' syndicate last year for ≥ 185 days, considers a "come point" for a further increase in the next contract.
Make the higher education a future promise
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long shift.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, descending and climbing a moment from the eyes at the view of white columns, bricks and green powders.
Graciela's parents could only finish school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put his feet on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) of the group exploded Gettysburg where the school costs were $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than the one of a new impressive student than an enthusiast.
Super This is where I will study! Graciela, who would like to study the doctor, while the guide was leading them to the input of the science's insult.
Youpi, really? she dreamed, when she was indicated to the weak teacher of law - student.
The Pennsylvania University was the seventh who visited children during their trip of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not to know if you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widespread for the large number of American children born by Spanish immigrant parents who left school where parents became adolescents, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the average class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the " Second Generation" on five-parted school studies -- a significant success if both their immigrated parents, most of Mexico or Central America, are entered into the United States without finishing school.
The researchers say that their success is important, they open the way to the following generations that will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study the students claim that these have a natural affinity with oil and a need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high objectives for their children and find ways to acquire their lack of familiarity with the American schools.
The mentorate programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like it to reach the university - particularly if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher in Davis, California University, who studied Latin-American students.
We need to think to offer a network of support to these children, from the mother's home to school.
The federal programme that financed the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known under the name of GEAR UP (prepare you) , he provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize preparation programs at the university that start when students of low income family are in the middle school (school) and continue until the end of school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent of the United States Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of the Iraqian Oil is obtaining agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqian Government has succeeded in attaching important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two weekends.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Ministry of Oil of Iraq with foreign oil companies suggest that Oil Companys in China, Russia and Europe are on the point of playing a major role in the remission of the Iraq Oil Industry, invalided by tens of years of war and sanctions.
The American companies are distributed with a share in only two of the 10 fields in the business.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second course that started Friday.
The only one who had put an inch lost.
Two American companies received contracts for the fields in June.
The low representation of American oil genders in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analystes.
Iraq finally opened his doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies opening the road, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum forum, a website of information on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Anxieties on security, corrupted by mass-coordinated bombing, Tuesday, and political instability, while the American military forces returned, have released the American petrol society, preventing them of more force in Iraq with the third largest oil reserve in the world, say the analystes.
In some cases, the American companies were disvantaged because of their employment, especially China and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose work costs were not later and who were more ready to take risks because they did not take account of shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and O©al Petroleum Inc. were the only American contracting companies with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhips, who have maintained strong links with the Ministry of Oil of Iraq, and have provided their technical advice to him, have distributed the empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main actors in two of the contracts assigned this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp, detained by the State, has more entered into contracts than other companies and is distributed with important shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is being a major economy, as well as a powerful power, said Assam Jihad, the Oil Minister's password.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies made offers that were then compared to the tax by barilla that the Ministry agreed to pay to the production above the current levels for each field.
One of Al-Qaida's main organizations would have been killed in Pakistan
It is that a American missile, who struck the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organisers of Al-Qaida operations this week, said on Friday from the American authorities of the anti-spionage.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders of this host.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspicious of being killed by a couple of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, from American sources and Pakistan authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles were carried out by an aircraft without pilot of the type used by ↓ within the Pakistan anarchical tribe border.
They conducted a white car, leading to the Afghanistan border, when the car was hit, a member of the Pakistanian civil secret services expressed at the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the Authority stated that the suspicious local soldiers were predicted and quickly confiscated what remained "without adequate body".
The local authorities were fully impossible to verify the identity of victims, but the two American anti-terrorist representatives gave unexpected evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of Al-Qaida military organizations responsible for the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to make complaints throughout the world, acknowledged one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of aircraft inside the Pakistan territory.
Because of its central role, this was likely to include attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategy of the Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authorities said that Somali had rapidly progressed in the al-Qaida's ranges and had a very good relationship with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the large American public, but it does not reduce the threat he constitutes for us and our associates, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important person of Al-Qaida or the second leader of Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of an office of soldiers in the tribe cinture, as well as three other operators.
The rythme of the attacks made by the drones of the ≥ has decreased since the sea, from about six operations per month to two, the numbers advanced by the Long War Journal, a moderate web site by a non-acquirent group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, even by killing the suspicious informators, the site states.
The United Nations Special Sender to Kaboul is departing
The United Nations special sentence to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would leave his post in March at the end of a tumultuous mandate of corruption declarations extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The Eide department intervenes while Obama's administration decided to send 30 000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations sent said that he supported this increase, but he expressed his concern regarding the United States' calend for a retreat of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force the other governments of the NATO to restore their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghanistan and remind them that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a Kabul phone maintenance.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomate also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officers has the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military mentionation must be copied by the citizens, he said.
Eide said that he did not leave but that he would simply respect the commitment he had taken to his family in March to pass only two years to Kaboul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was two months empty between my pre-check and my arrival.
According to the United Nations representatives, Ban has already started seeking a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who recently presided a United Nations mission in Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has managed the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former advocate, Peter W. Galbraith, accused of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and dissimulation of evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these claims, but he said that Galbraith - which was thanked - had been injured to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism for the international voting observation.
Eide stated that he had proposed the nomination of a civil representative in order to coordinate the secures of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted on the United Nations Responsibles to authorise his follower to acquire more staff from the United States and other Occident countries than it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would allow them to be more trusted in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed its frustration with regard to the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy regulations in the United Nations had the possibility of bringing new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I could only recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't take it.
Gates: Iran must submit additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert Gates said on Friday that the great world powers would soon impose "valuable additional sanctions" on Iran because of his incapacity to engage in nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressed before a partner of 300 American soldiers northern Iraq, during a week visit in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, degradated the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, said he, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a denouncement.
One of the things I'm most imprisoned is that if I learned something in Iraq in the last six years, it's the impressed side of the war.
Obama's administration considers a set of sanctions that would show Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians of the street.
He said that "in motivation and punishment" could be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "the people would suffer greatly" of these sanctions.
Wednesday, in a statement of the White House's portfolio, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if he does not completely reflect its nuclear programme in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its Supervisory Agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop his nuclear experience only in a peaceful purpose.
In Geneva's speakers, on 1 October, he pointed out that he would represent the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to leave a significant part of its storage of ura enrichi, in exchange of fuel unexpectedly necessary for a medical research reaction.
The administration encouraged such a agreement, a way to develop confidence on both sides and to gain time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have been removed from an agreement attempts - in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divorced on whether or not to be involved with the United States.
I sincerely encouraged Iran's racing towards some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October, encouraged the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they did not consider, in terms of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
The President Obama set on 31 December as a date limited to Iran to answer the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the follow-up of what the State Secretary of Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "accurate sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran mission to the United Nations stated what it calls "unbased claims" of some of the Iran nuclear activities members of the Security Council and claimed that it was agreed to continue talking with the United States and five other great world powers, "with a satisfying long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington after Friday, met the morning, the Iraq Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the airplane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the ships responsible in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Strengths persistent between the Kurdes and the Arab majority in Iraq, especially with regard to borders, property rights and income share.
Gates urged the two parties to reduce the potential conflict to avoid all losses of the American plans for reduction of the number of American troops, from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of the month of ao.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurdes about the suspension. The American authorities quoted Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will keep your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within an unified Iraq."
We will not leave you."
In ancient China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew around with propagands, saying, "The Mother Earth is too fatigued to get more children" and "A baby is more, it's a grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient rate of birth in their city and the age of the population, had radically changed the direction of this sea and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was continuous and closed: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have any seconds, said Wang, 31 years of age, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the unique child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children noteworthy with good games and shots, called the "small emperor", a population's crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average rate of birth has fallen from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more will explode from 16,7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 per cent in 2050, which is higher than the average of approximately 20 per cent.
This disbalance is still worse in the rich coast cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old people represented nearly 22 percent of the population of residents recorded in Shanghai, while the birthrate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (The Commission of the Municipal People of Shanghai and the Family Planning) said that the fertile couples have children to "help to reduce the proportion of the older people and to prevent the lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is on the point of become "as old - but not so rich, however - that developed countries like Japan and Sweden" said.
A progressive decline
In the constitution of the country in 1978, the Single Chine policy of the child is the most controversial obligation introduced by the Government today.
Parents who translate this policy may be able to pay colossal amendments -- until three times their annual income -- and to discriminate on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have declared abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced women of a second child to abort.
Furthermore, many couples have been addressed to selective abortions leading to a boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adopted their position on the single child's policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule - including for the residents of the cities, the members of the ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already unique children - and in 2007, they took many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor of the Institute of Population Research (Population Research Institute), at the University of Peking, stated that the central government authorities recently discussed more radical changes, such as the couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage birth.
In no time, posters who encourage families to have only one child were replaced by detailed copys of regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to make the request for employment.
The Government of the city has dismissed responsibility for family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home and slipped prospects under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the responsible for family planning, the answer was deceived.
Deceiving response
Although responsibles in a rural village in Shanghai say that they have seen an increase in the requests for a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban district reported that there was no change.
The community of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, always receives only four or five requests per month.
Shanghai's responsible states that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is always intended to be about 165 000 -- more than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for the family planning committee in the Caolu of Shanghai community, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child, said she.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would worship two children and that they were authorised there.
But as many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The ODAs think that the single child's policy is a problem of rights, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is seven months of the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, responsible for humous resources, said she wanted only a unique child because she was one of her own. "We were the centre of the family and we had the habit that everyone cared about us."
We don't have the habit to take care of someone else and we really don't want to care for others."
Chen Seiian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, this is more crucial.
For couples working at two, average class, which reduce the rate of birth, he says, it must be selfish as successful.
The 20 or 30-year-old people grew up by seeing their parents in the first time of the capitalist China and wouldn't want to have their own life, he said.
Even one child asks for a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of its social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for → a place in the best mother. "
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for reduction of emissions
The Conference on Climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized up to now by deceased affectations and mutual rehabilitations -- has come back under the fires of the rampe Friday, because of the publication of a document which emphasizes ambitious reductions of gases in the next 40 years, with industrialized nations that are most of the load, in the next time.
The text that could provide the bases of a final political agreement to regulate gas effects has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as far as it lighted the road to take.
But it was seen as an important progress in negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world in the next week to Copenhagen.
A special group of work in the United Nations does not say how many rich countries would give poor people to support climate heat, currently and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economys and new emerging economys could reduce their carbon production and what would be the highest limit of global temperature tolerance that the responsible would be tolerated.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative of Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited six pages of the document, studied a text of 180 pages of negotiations to discuss what the Exact Secretary-General described on the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the direct lines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
The countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also repeated negotiations on Friday, promised to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change - to support inundations and dryness or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbale changes have occurred, which have dominated negotiations since the last week.
Todd Star, representative of the United States for climate negotiations, has rejected any debate obliged to reduce gas-effective gas by industrialized countries, comparing voluntary efforts made by the main economy if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration has become more difficult to China than Bush administration, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, says Starn, who also regrets that the text is not enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Staren made its comments a hour after the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the American main negotiator, either lacking "good meaning", was "deeply irresponsible" for saying that the United States would not financially help China to fight climate heat.
With the future economic travelers of the main global powers in the game, deficiencies have occurred both within the third world and between the industrial world and the enormous economy.
The current battle relates more to salvation of individual economys than to save the planet, with China and the United States concerned about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the most important dozens of countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Delegate of Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were to know the costs of the reduction of the gas effects, even though the vulnerable countries were more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hemmonie has been developed, said Ulate, which is also Consultation on Climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries were more vulnerable to the impact of climate changes have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a treaty obligatory in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will be at least to a political agreement.
The Small Insulary States Alliance, which meet 43 members, has prepared a 24-page proposal on Friday morning.
Arturge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of the small island States had "a political pressure on the full political process" in part by the unifiedness of them now, and that they ask for enormous economys such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent case, while the delegates focused on the fact that they would solve most of the problems in instance before the Government leaders arrived to an agreement.
High-level responsibles such as the Indian Environment Ministry, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Ministry have come down from their plane and have been predicted in the Bella Center in order to assist home-lock meetings and information conferences in order to make claims that will be studied during the next week.
The real image of race -- during which 13,000 people enter and get out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar activists have nocturn spectacles that are moving from countries, trading themselves and that proposals are edited and distributed on paper instead of by email -- is a real challenge.
Intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are going to the Court of Grands, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, President of the World Conservation Policy.
Hard weights come.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefinite the syndrome of Monday
At 5:13, Monday morning, a sifflet shot will perceive the night to signal the outcome of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The first high-speed bathroom train of the country will reach 225 km/h, while it will go from Ashford, in the Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes at the first Javelin bathroom outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Great Britain to integrate a international rapid and reliable train network and to link the large concurrences of Midlands, North and Ecosse in London.
Small lost troops will become flowing landscape cities, business travel durations will be much less long, and the transition of the air and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions, while reducing the road embossment.
In theory, the three main political parties are attached to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers are risked to broadcast britain lines at high speed.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a report of fabric for the Government will give its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will enable him to make a detailed card of the next step scheduled for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the city area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversed.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final road.
HS2 is also expected to provide three options for a higher speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer the first time.
The privileged options are advanced in a configuration in Y for which a high speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be separated into two to or near Birmingham, with a rubber going to the west of the Pennsylvania to Manchester and Ecosse and another going north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line will cross the Ecosse.
"It'll be the best option for performance," said a rail professional.
When it is finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a current hour travel.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400 km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow trains of 400m long and to transport 1100 people.
Until 18 trains per hour can work on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that can receive 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
As the space limits are given, an existing garage is expected to be increased to receive the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry say that only St. Pancras International or Euston offers this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks that the project should be implemented, but longer consultations and planning procedures means that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it starts the machine, the network should be built by part.
The trains will be obliged to move out of high-speed lines on the railways in the north of Birmingham, keeping travel durations between London and Ecosse above three hours.
This solution is the best to ensure a transition of aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for rail revolution.
Contributors refund the 75.000 GBP loan for the Tory's Orea
Alan Duncan, the main member of the parliament of Tory, made the contributor of thousands of books per year to restore the cost of an oral orality that he built in his house of his circuit.
The responsibility of the party that David Cameron was retrograded to complain that the members of the parliament were "intained" has increased its 75.000 GBP loan to build a chenion in his second house in Rutland.
It had been authorised to pay additional interests, which amounted to hundreds of books per month, to the contributor.
The Commons authorities received complaints at that moment and were not asked by Sir Thomas Lee, who carried out a control of the expenditure of the members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "more or more simple".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, is owner of a two-country house in a village of its circonscription of Rutland - Melton.
Adventure houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The cooked resort includes a kitchen, a room and a room to eat, but the emolutions office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he embraced a veranda at the house, described it in its plans as an orphan.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda to please it".
Mr Duncan has not been asked to explain the loans in a recent investigation made by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Communities, regarding its provisions of preliminary loans.
The Committee was innocent in the last month of any non-respect of the rules after an investigation on its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan held the legal security of the premium of 27°406 GBP of London's property at the house of his circonscription which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the Parliament.
This week documents show that Mr Duncan claimed about 1.400 GBP per month of rental interest until March last year.
In April, its requests increased more than 1.800 GBP per month.
The interest rate of Mr Duncan's RBS loan has not been changed at that moment, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the 75.000 GBP loan.
The standard standard rate of RBS has passed from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without moving from that time.
The latest publication of the Common authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask ↓50 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his post of the Fantom Cabinet in September, after a journalist covered itself, saying that the members of Parliament would survive "on the budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live "on budget" and you are treated as "m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked a small part based on what was right.
And I could have asked much more, but I didn't."
The member of the Parliament, a millionnary from his former post as a negotiator in oil, began to explain its expenditure in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before he agreed with the cost office that this could be considered "soft".
A activist buried a £ cup in Mr Duncan's puzzle to protest after it was discovered that he had requested 4.000 GBP for three years.
Questioned on the premises, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the cost office and then by the Law."
He said: "There is no problem with deployment or development or use of rules or anything.
It was actually, in the rules, authorised, etc.
It couldn't be more clean or more simple."
Fields, come to see the calendar of the Avent of Brighton
Brighton's beach cabins found a new way to promote for winter months, a calendar of the Interactive Avent.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church who encourages the creativity exploration, invited 24 owners to cover their cabin for each December day, using as theme Noël's songs.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the latest cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, each day, with feet and hot wine freely served.
Noël's songs still selected include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christ", for which the cabine presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year marketing TV assistant in Hove, is an unbalansed priest from the diocese of Chichester and Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old immortality? It calls me that the Church should draw closer to people and collect in a more spectacular way.
"The idea of the calendar of the Aventure of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends during a dinner.
Brighton is a so creative and vibrant place, and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Fort mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have shown Sabbath to claim an ambitious and committing agreement on the fight against climate heat throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police has been conducted to several hundreds of interplections.
At least thirty thousand people, the police, a hundred thousand people, have spent in the cold in the Danish capital, at the end of the United Nations Conference on Climate, which was charged by the end of Friday to an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Denmark's President of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilisation throughout the world, illustrated by these manifestations, has contributed to "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred soon after the department of the cortege, when a group of 300 manifestants, completely clothed of black, broke vitrines with pave and martyrs, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-emeute police have soon been intervened without household.
In total, the police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, mainly from the members of the Black Blocks, these ultraviolent groups, which were particularly illustrated at the top of NATO in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the manifestation organizations, stated the conditions in which hundreds of soldiers were interplyed "without distinction", highlighting that a hundred of them "all were always held on the Sunday Street night "meeted and maintained in position despite extreme cold".
Part of the Parliament, the courtage, a very good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The demonstrants stopped around 500 meters of the building, without seeking to pass it.
A scene was taken to accept the planned speakers, before a guardian to the sandals with the participation of the ancient South African architect of the Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrants came in car and worked in large cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them in impermeable blue heaven, had made a first race in the morning in Copenhagen, calling the Earth's Friends, who heard forming "blaue mares" for the "justice for the climate".
Today, we are down to the streets to ask for repair of the debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, military Phillip of the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: We have time, estimated Kidjo's blessed song.
There are clusters that sit in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we never did before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative movement was drawn to environmental organizations.
The French Commissioner José Bové, represented by the altermonialism, explained to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "then there is no break between the fight against climate heat and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens many particularly vulnerable islands to the heating, has given the outcome of demonstrations.
About 50,000 people, organizers, were descended in the streets.
In Manille, some hundreds of people, students most of them, shooted in red, trees of bandanas that gain solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, races of some hundred demonstrants have also been taken to make an energy action against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (western) and Lyon (east).
Some tens of people gathered themselves in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist chose his president, Georgia declares a "farce"
Abkhazia chose his president Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilissi called a "farce".
Some 130,000 people were invited to participate in this first review after the Russian Georgian War of Ao's 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognised by Russia.
The voting offices closed at 17.00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before closing, responsible for the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results of the year were held on Saturday night at Sunday.
The five school candidates, among whom the president, Serguei Bagapch, reject categoryally the idea of the meeting with Georgia, who condemned the vote.
These elections are a floor.
On its hand, the Georgian President, Mikheïl Saakachvili, "requests that Abkhazia is fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his portrait, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 residents, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which has committed thousands of dead, Abkhazia is trying to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new E.C. as an independent State, said to the AFP Svetlana Kvariya, a 54-year-old historian who said that he had voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to a vote office at a school of Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is to the heart of the presidential in this region in the souptuous landscapes at the border of the Black Sea.
Great panels shown by Mr. Bagapch at the side of the president and the Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Poutine are installed a littlewhere in this small area of 216.000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the leader of the district, ́lan Archba, reserved a warm accommodation to the Russian responsibles who were coming to monitor the scrutinisation.
We, the Abkhaze people, have said, during a small ceremonie, to support Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, answered Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and raised a waterka glass.
On its hand, the opposition represented by the former President Raoul Khadjiba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and ́lan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscou last year, as the heavens in Russia control over railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more is needed to receive the election.
If no candidate reaches this level, a second tour must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have traveled on Sabbath in the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen climate Conference, where the police, on who lives, interplyed nearly 700 people in the margin of an impressive manifestation.
Thirty thousand people, the police, a hundred thousand persons, have spent in cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which receives 193-life delegates until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of the Parliament, the courtage, globally good child, took the leading of the Bella Center, where negotiations are running.
The manifestants stopped around 500 meters from the center, without seeking to pass it.
A scene was taken to accept the planned speakers, before a guardian to the sandals with the participation of the ancient South African architect of the Cap, Desmond Tutu.
Some instants after the department of the cortege, a group of some hundred manifestants, completely clothed with black clothing, bricks and martyrs, broke vitrines, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-emeute police have soon surrounded them and intervened without household, casting several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 persons, indicating that it was mainly members of "The Black Blocks", these ultraviolent groups, which were particularly illustrated at the top of the NATO in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a policeman was wounded by a pave and four cars burned near a squat during accidents that led to the interpelling of a twenty-five people, the police.
We have eyes on extreme groupuscules, had warned the police's password, Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were turning into heaven.
The majority of demonstrants, coming in car and trained by large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or even from Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them in impermeable blue heaven, had made a first race in the morning in Copenhagen, calling the Earth's Friends, who heard forming "blaue mares" for the "justice for the climate".
Today, we are down to the streets to ask for repair of the debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, military Phillip of the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: We have time, estimated Kidjo's blessed song.
There are cups that sit in Africa, there are water courses where we can walk while we never had done it before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative movement was drawn to environmental organizations.
The French Commissioner José Bové, representing the altermondialism, said to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "linking climate justice and social justice": "then's no break between the fight against climate heat and the fight for another world."
Oxfam's organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish mannequin Helena Christiansen, the former United Nations Commissioner to Mary Robinson's repositories, who will address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens many particularly vulnerable islands to the heating, has given the outcome of demonstrations.
About 50,000 people, organizers, were descended in the streets.
In Manille, some hundred people, students most of them, have manifested red clothes and trees of bandanas that enhance solar energy in front of the philippine capital mairi.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, races of some hundred demonstrants have also been taken to make an action against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (western) and Lyon (east).
Some tens of people gathered themselves in Geneva.
The geo history is strengthened from the reform of the general school,• Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enhanced" from the reform of the General School, despite the elimination of their mandatory education in scientific terminal.
Now, the first-year-olds will have every four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "We need to get out of hypocrisy" because, he, "the branch S is no longer a scientific branch" but "in large, it's the best."
The ES and L branches can't remain subfills of the S, and he continues: "I haven't even heard many historicals and intellectuals injury from the absent of the in-terminal geographic history in schools."
Samedi, an ifop survey in the Humanity, revealed that nearly seven Frances on ten (69%) disapprovaled the governmental project to remove the mandatory education of the history-geographic in the terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and certain right elections.
However, the Minister said that it was not "no question" to remove the philosophy of the S terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teachers' training, while 16 organizations (studiants and syndicates) called on a Sunday mobilization day to protest against the project, which offers them the pedagogic training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass in the beginning of the year a test of acceptability that will bring on their discipline, and then, at the end of the year, a test of adoption that will bring on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow situation stages during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the stage as stage teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the concurrence, you already get more presence in front of the concurrence, or more than 300 hours, it has continued.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in the National Education".
He also reaffirms the project to remove the school card "from 2012".
A Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about injuries from the top of Copenhagen: this is the challenge that took place on Saturday morning, Jean Jouzel, President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Normal School above the Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Price of Peace, introduced the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of an enlargement of expert interventions, each 15 minutes, filmed and opened to the public, found a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that takes people and gives them the desire to know more, explained in the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day, who takes his name of that given by the fish of the bassin of the olive.
A twenty-five intervenants are chosen among the experts of their discipline and they are chosen for their charismatic side, it has stated.
About climate heating, "We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said APP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with graphics, before a fifty people.
This is a part of our Scientific role, which he stressed, hopeing that the auditors will notice that "the Copenhagen Conference supports an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos taken from these conferences will be online on the site of the oil from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others to a bimestrial rythme.
Payment delays: wrath of prison overseers, planned action
The prison supervisory syndicates called on Friday to "general mobilization" to request the payment of the year-end feasts and additional hours for which the payment was revoked in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2e syndicate of supervisors) requested staff who would not be able to demonstrate Tuesday morning before penitentiary institutions and "lock them" to "declare the flight of their duss".
The CGT-penitentiary (3th syndicat of the profession) calls them to "meet themselves in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", which judges "honest and inacceptable" non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and Fridays" worked in October.
And the first syndicate of overseers, the Ufap/Unsa Federal Autonomous Federal Union (Ufap/Unsa), " calls on general mobilization... to raise disappointment and anger."
The Penitentiary Management Directory and the Ministry of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased much in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the rest will be paid in January.
The Chancellerie at the end of the day indicated that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a court to the supervisory syndicates to ensure that this payment would be made in the next month.
I do not know the efforts provided by staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, written by the Minister of Justice in this court.
I requested to the Penitentiary Administration to take a series of measures without time to make that this situation of a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours will not reproduce in the future, Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The payment in December, therefore, will be greater, except for the staff who benefit from primary functions and objectives, has deployed Ufap/Unsa, for which "the budgetary limits have a good back".
It's a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycotter up to the new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Fridays and Fridays if those of October are not regular in December, the same for additional hours, also threatened by FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvernya.
When our tasks and missions are increased without increased efficiency, it is more than regretable to be taken to the staff debtors, it considers the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the syndicates, the situation is not the same in all regions, while some are less bad lots than others.
But in all ways the account is not there, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "cookie pigs" than those he receives
The American President Barack Obama, who ready to pass his first Christmas in family to the White House, confided to the "papape" of the small Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give more cool things than those I receive."
In the context of a special emission that will be spread on the ABC chain on Sunday evening, the President and his wife Michelle offer a review of how they hear collecting the end-year festivals in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small companion of four families will be part of the party.
The Father Christ also loves Bo, thus said Michelle Obama, indicating that the dog would have "without sure" a gift, the extractions of the emission spread before.
And Michelle Obama was falsely registered against her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts he received: "I have certainly offered you good gifts last year," she tackled the President.
Absolutely, has it been obliged to concede before replicating with humor by showing the finger of the first lady's perle's finger: "Who has offered this to you?"
During this one hour, in the distressed atmosphere, with the famous animatory support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the President and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama called a 10-speed wheel, but also a basketball ballon that his Kenyan father had seen rarely offered him to Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It's just later in my life I realized that it was him who gave me this ballon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her cuphouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the cells against the wall instead of arranging them around the road, but I loved this little house of popped, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL claims that he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles because of important "lesions" after a operation in France, but the situation is "controlled" of its surrounding, while RTL claims that the song was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock was reopened on Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles' hospital after the American doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discal heritage in Paris on 26 November, indicated his press service to Paris, indicating that these lesions had "need a repair operation".

According to RTL, partner of the last turning of the song, however, Johnny Hallyday would have been plucked in a artificial coma to avoid "faults and complications".
It is only 48 hours that we will have a little more sure about the patient's status when it will open an eye, RTL.
Inquired by the AFP, the press service has not confirmed or commented on the information.
RTL also states that "only certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rock was operated at the international clinic of the Monceau Park for this discal hernium.
The intervention programmed for several days has been practiced by Neurochirurgian Stéphane Delajoux, a very known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the song was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinai hotel of Los Angeles for a conseffective infection in the intervention.
The song E日 Mitchell, a nearby Johnny Hallyday, felt Thursday on RTL that his friend passed "a bad pass", but assuredly he didn't make "no worry" for the rock, which is "a guardian".
He called me just before I was going to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a joke because it was twelve hours of plane after such a operation, it's not playable, said E. Mitchell.
Wednesday evening, the song manufacturer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to make sure that Johnny Hallyday "reacted in a satisfying way to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endivided".
Mr. Camus had also said to have entered Laeticia, the song's wife, and not noticed special concerns.
But the sanctor's health concerns have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had been revealed to have been operated by a "small cancer of the collon," then by a Other Infection.
End September, the song recovered his long "Tour 66", presented as his tour of adieus.
But since, every health problem has been very commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the song to move on the scene.
In mid November, his surrounding even had to delay a new hospitalisation.

The French Fréderick Bousquet, triple medal in the Worlds-2009 in large bassine, broke a international title on a distance that he especially loves, the 50m free nag at the Euro-2009 in the small bassin in Istanbul.

Bousquet advanced Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to reduce the world mark (20.30) as he had considered.
We can always dream better, and in the case, I said, if the record of the world was at my place, I would like to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the nagers were clothed of polyuretan combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
In the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epoca in Istanbul, which had accepted the first in 1999 during the same competition.
The use of combinations hasn't been used this time to German Paul Bi_mann, double campaign of the world in large bassine this sea in Rome, records of the world to the key.
The young nageer failed to decrease the mark he had on 400 m free nage (3:32.77) but he imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glasner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this course.
I knew that this time I couldn't keep a record of the world but I could defend my title and have completed my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained by Bi_mann.

It was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars from the third century after Jesus Christ.

The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola returns to a few days.
The panel remained nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgesian family, then then appeared at the French actor Cıile Sorel, who had made it a part of his bathroom in his special hotel in Paris, and Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and shortly President of the Council before the accession to the power of the Sea of Peter.

Aborted department attempt from Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer meet for the transfer to its territory of Honduras' departed president, Manuel Zelaya, which saw a non-conduct by the Pushist Government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, all indicate that the possibilities of this transfer are not meet, said the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
On Wednesday in Salvador to return Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican Government's airport is distributed to its origin, a source of the Directorate-General of Migrations.
The Pushist government wanted Mr. Zelaya to "release" and to ask for the foreign political asylum to grant him a non-conduct.
However, the Defence Chairman was determined because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest of State.
The pushist government "found a new failure, wanting me to reject my burden..., they wanted me to leave," Mr. Zelaya said to the Globo radio, on which he often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis last five months in the Central America country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitation, playing a few agreements by the deceived president, repeated to the ambassade of Brazil in Tegucigalpa for two months and half.
The Ambassador of Mexico presented us a request for non-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it contains no asile request, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Pushist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, at HRN radio.
I don't ask asylum to any country, but Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview at the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
An existing department from Honduras should be made as the president of the Hungarian people.
Mr. Zelaya's voices were mobilised on Wednesday, the parties of the Dechu President, who came to raise around Brazil's ambassador, where military people strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the Pushist Government.

Exiled to Costa Rica, he was surprised on September 21, and re-reactivated to Brazil's ambassador.
If it comes out, it will be arrested to respond to the crime of "height tragedy" whose accusation of justice, the Pushist government.
The president of Pushist Roberto Micheletti was able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was chosen during the controversial investigation recognised by the United States but contested by Latin America countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against the return of Mr. Zelaya until the end of its mandate on 27 January.

In or before the same pharmacovigilance, it took a couple, whose wife was insane.
The husband, age 30 years old, interrupted and was wounded.
The first two victims, greedyly wounded, have been admitted to the hospital where the octogenary was deteriorated.
The days of the other vulnerable are in danger, living organs are apparently touched, police sources.
The zealous woman then made a disease and would have been hospitalized "in choc state", a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under alcohol or drug company, a police source, would then flee into the street, always bulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have wounded two injuries, apparently in the past: a thirty-engineer and a quarter, the last wound.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two bottles that he was carrying in cross behind his back, explained at the place a responsible for the Syndicat Alliance in the High-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Many young people, including witnesses collected by the AFP, have tried to control the forced.
I've seen a type of 30 years with a green wheat.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't come there because the guy was costud, reported Alberto, a server of a nearby bar.

U.S.: The lawyer of Polanski requires the abandon of persecutions
The French-Polonian cinema advocate Roman Polanski reclamed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), abandoning prosecutions against his customer, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for more than 30 years of death.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist", stated before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second Californian District of serious procedure errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I call for the leave of charges here and now, Mr Hummel said, before saying that the behavior of the case charged at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cool in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- had been dead since -- had discussed, before he had sentenced, with a prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedure fault.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), even the prosecutor's mouth, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said to have "liar" to the author of the documentary.
If the Court would leave the proceedings, Mr. Hummel claimed to be held in a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentary.
The accusation repeated the argument already developed in the first instance, meaning that no transfer of charges could be severely studied until Roman Polanski would not be presented before the court.
The cineast, age of 76, fled from the United States in 1978, before the sentence of his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He never left the feet to the United States since.
Phyllis Asayama, advocate of the Court of Los Angeles, said that Roman Polanski " must be there to be in the audience".
In this case, do we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to others accused that it is possible to escape?, asked Mrs. Asayama.
For her, the cineast "demands a favor to the court, while disappointing her authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were other alternatives to escape.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for leave of persecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the persecution.
Remembering that her client doesn't support any rebuilding of the Polanski case anymore, she said: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest mandate.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chat, expecting a possible extradition.

The standard & Poor's 500 extension progressed with 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, highlighted Mace ́cksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in extreme margins, the exchange volume has become very low and I think that it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic operators than intended, which "increased the market opinion on the solidity of the economic recovery", resumed Charles Schwab's analystes.
In the United States, detailed profits increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of defeat and much more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of the US consumers was just resumed in December, at .4 against 67.4 in the month, the preliminar estimation of the University of Michigan.
However, the indications have been released by a new progress of the dollar, the highest for two months in front of the euro, which "makes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick from the German Bank.
The values of the land have thus lost.
The compulsory market has decreased.
The 10-year performance of the treasury has increased to 3.540% against 3.482% Thursday evening, and to 4.497% against 4.492% the guard.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month of period throughout South Africa, 112 candidates under Miss Monde are prepared to break the last right line on Saturday to make their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion televisors.
During this great mess of beauty organized for the second consequent year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already cut off their ticket for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada have been chosen at the time of their African residence.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visition of beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap was extraordinary.
I have seen many things and see so many experiences!, Mrs. Sierra Leone.
This competition for the nineth time in South Africa is directly transferred from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to return my coron.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm happy to have it twice, Mrs. Monde Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of the Australian east.
For the young Russian, its second residence in South Africa was marked by many trades with candidates and re-detected "the landscape to cut the wild in this country".
After a month of gallas, repetitions, meetings with press and safari, the Misss are now on competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, chosen in 2000, and present this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of any woman to be covered the most beautiful in the world, but it's just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to come back to me with the coron, Lance Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organisers, music and dance, this 59th edition will be pointed out.
The candidates will be thrown in traditional and of course in bathroom maillot.
The spectacle will be encouraged by a television presentation, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty Queen Michelle McLean and a responsible for the Committee of Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that she knew to accept the world with a heat and proudness that is difficult to equate, assure Julia Morley, president of Miss Monde.
As last year, the candidates have made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time at the wheel, and bought the local kitchen.
With exception, they also met the South African president Jacob Zuma, who took their hands.
It's not fitting for a State leader, note Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will certainly remain the outcome in Cap (Southwest) for the Football World of June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've frequented people that I never thought I could come near.
I'm sure going back for World-2010, enthusiasm Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assured his son David on Friday at his arrival to the Airport of Los Angeles, where he had to go to his father's head hospitalized for several days.
News are very positive.
He's very strong, it's very good, said to the press David Hallyday at his outcome from the airport that brought him from Paris a little after 13h00 locals (21:00 GMT).
The son of the son of the song, who was arrested, assured that he was going to become "very fast" at the Cedars-Sinai hotel of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection in the operation of a hernie was disclosed on 26 November in Paris.
The song was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and able to handle his treatment," the press service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday has already been placed in an artificial coma by the doctors of the Hospital Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a hernie dissuade on 26 November in Paris.
The song had to be reopened on Wednesday night on Thursday because of important lesions resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French school in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school spectacle, found a photograph of the AFP.
The chief of orthopedic and traumatological surgery of the hospital of Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would come to Los Angeles on Monday with the song.
The manufacturer violated Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurochirurgian who operated the song on 26 November at the International Monceau Park Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The chirurgians in Los Angeles said they were over, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard of a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thought that Johnny Hallyday was "too quickly shared for Los Angeles, with Paris's chirurgians."
I had this doctor on-line who assured me that there was no problem with this traveling and that was ashamed of me, since I had two discreet hernishes myself, he'd have.
Shortly before on the RTL, he indicated that the song was apparently "part without drain, without nothing" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actor Marie Trintigant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a Neilly-on-Seine clinic where he was exercising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to resume a hematome after a brain bleeding.
But it is also a doctor of the sulfurous reputation, condemned several times by justice, in medical matters, as well as for tax fraud and scratch.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scrupules" continued "regularly" before the Order Council, which is "never to be recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "perfectly deployed" and that post-operational reviews were "normal".
The operation "not was bloody and therefore didn't need to put a drain," he said.
In any case, the tourning of the song, whose health concerns have been multiplied since this sea, is between parentheses.
It is evident that a renewal of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as intended is very short, said Mr Camus.
The UDF increases the tone and sums the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF, controlled by the François Bayrou MoDem, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre Herve Morin, on the sign of the former Giscardenian party, and continued to use it on no support anymore, in the case of legal prosecutions.
Hervé Morin announced his intention to recover the UDF sign, judgeing that François Bayrou was not deserving to defend his political inheritance after he had drawn his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is partner of the UDP, had also planned to confirm this Saturday Strategy before the National Council of the NC.
To support its approach, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charrette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who returned the property of the UDF mark for being the first to submit it to the National Institute of Industrial property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not hear to leave their ownership, has come out of his silence to put a stay to the Minister and to the Member, so that they should no longer use the sign and send them the property of the mark, in the lack of legal prosecutions.
You multiplyed the statements that you were going to offer your political movement to +receive the UDF signature, written in a court signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also believed that it was good to follow your military material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +l'UDF of today+, also find signatures of the court.
As you do not know it, you have no right to use this signature, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to return "the name of the UDF immediately from any support and (her) web site".
He also requests Hervé de Charrette to "send the property of (la) mark to its right-hand-times".
If you did not, the courts would be arrested to comply with the law and the rights of the UDF adherents, the signatures are predicted.
In their court they indicate that UDF is a political movement from 1978 and reminds that Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre, therefore, has no right to use the UDF sign (the Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the latest UDF congress voted in 2007 for three years with the establishment of a Office loaded to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charrette, followed the office, "as he put the mark," he was "more adherent to the UF for three years", but to the UMP.
It is scandally and fraudulently beneficial of the depth abstention of the UDF acronym to perform it for its account.
This indelicateness is being transformed into crime, they say, before ironizing the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by yourself than to try to get out of the anonymate by fraudulently taking a name to which you do not have right."
Affairs Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for weakness abuse
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billion of Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a weak state of the octogenary for a part of its fortune.
The 62-year-old photograph, known for its star photos, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for weakness abuse, a punishment of a maximum penalty of three years of prison and 375.000 euros of amendment.
This decision means that there will be a process in this case worth a saga on one of the most rich families in France, in which mother and girls are departed by holding the dreams of the Cosmetic Empire L'Oreal.
But the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted by three doctors.
The Main Heritage and Actionary of L'Oreal has always been subject to such an examination, in any case under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Park at the investigation.
The designated doctors will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010, especially if Liliane Bettencourt was able to be weak and at which periods.
I think she's going to be here.
I'm going to talk to her about, told Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieman.
For its part, the lawyer of France Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
It is a good news... The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old woman that we must protect, he said.
Since two years, the only girl of Liliane Bettencourt has committed persecutions against Francois-Marie Banier, photograph and artist has touched all, that she has been accused of having benefited for years of her mother's weakness for a billion euros, in the form of checks, life-assurance contracts or master tables.
On its side, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photograph, which she considers as a long-term friend.
While the court had to examine the receiptability of the action taken by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' advocates sometimes turned to the large family packaging on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her reporter, in which she was defiant to the husband of France Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the court of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt was, the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
French, I couldn't talk to her since his marriage."
In its part, the parquet of Nanterre recalled that the complainant was not able to act, as far as a judge of the Tutorial has made the last days a right to make her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt has full ability to act in justice, she is not protected and has no protector.
Nobody else has to act at his place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that it would be stated once the sentence had occurred on the receiptability of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Administrative or end of economic intellectual revolution?
If nothing changes the Government of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intellectuals will be vanity...
Since more than one decade of years, the attitude of the management of large undertakings for the purpose of its salaries reminds the position of consumers intended before marketing revolution: it is to adhere to "values" determined above as it was previously, to impose the consumers of the products thought by the machine technicians.
By putting the customer in the heart of the company, marketing revolution replaced market conquering strategy at the place... although the authoritary attempt to impose offline products from customer preference factors is regularly returned!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the part of a much more general phenomena that affects the frames.
This demobilization is seriously involved in the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including the D&D and, more, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU "requires all interested parties... a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires the employee a commitment that the authoritary management income is totally contrary.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would be putting the employees in the centre of business concerns in the same title as the customer.
All related use of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion investigations –as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salaries, will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Above all, because I could find that, in view of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after a lot of turns, to do priorityly... what she has always done.
- Then, because of the spirit – one of the pathologies of the power- crosses proportionally the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
In the high schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by "neurological" states and broadly spread by studies and media institutions.
Thus, suggesting that the "levels" (sic) of the framework commitment are possible in a recent investigation of Ipsos in the Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a mechanistic government position, which is inadequate in the world today.
Enhance and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the management revolution needed for the good function of modern enterprises is to adopt a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reason or practice of governance, an accuracy: for the salariers, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears like a way to perform a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies issued by the Motive Analysis adopt this concept of the motivations of employees.
These studies showed that they judge their company based on a pre-determined doxa that allows them, through their imagination of the company, to evaluate what it offers to carry out their life projects.
As a result of the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and re-manage their "placed resources".
They thus create a favourable area for the consolidated development of a strong and effective economic development.
Oslo talks: the "just war" values loving right in Obama
The American law welcomed Friday the speech spoken in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Price 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservators, who brocarded the price allocation to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, as well as Sarah Palin, an ancient candidate to the presidency at the elections of 2008.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the right oil of the Republican party, in the United States Today day, who had discussed the theme of the war "as of sometimes necessary" in its memories that are just being made.
The war is well heard of the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
You have to stop those terrorists all over there, she's assumed.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his president George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, employed on Thursday in Oslo to justifie the relief to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the President had made Oslo "the very good work".
I found that the talk was very good, and the former president of the House of Representatives, which especially appreciated the statement of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential proposal.
On some sides, I found this entirely historical talk, said Mr. Gingrich, questioned during the "The Takeaway" radio emission.
The former chosen, considered by some as a potential candidate to the public investment for the presidential election of 2012, was pleased to have seen "a "left president" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and that they could not return a peace price if the complaint to force was not existing."
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's ancient pump revert a chronic to Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American speaker".
Besides being presented in "the citizen of the world" as "He always does it", "he spoke as a American president", reminding the Europeans "that they live in a security bull that they have not created and that they do not do much to keep it," Mr. Gerson said.
Among the rare to be not convinced, a faucon of Bush’s ear, the former ambassador in the United Nations John Bolton, qualified the speech of "terne, ampulated and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, the Democracy Representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the complaint to force.
When war is involved in the concept of justice, it is easy to justifie the massacre of innocents.
However, the center-left press remained pleasant at the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continued to think that the Nobel was first assigned to Mr. Obama, qualified his "superproduction" award even for a known speaker for his talent.
"Oslo's speech should be used as a road to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," was burned in the California daily.
Mr. Obama "pronounced the speech it needed," the New York Times, judged "too dark and building".
Routers: three marathons for a agreement that saves Christmas supplys
At three Marathon negotiations meetings, the travel sector syndicates and TLF, only patronal organization to remain until the end, reached on Friday evening to an agreement that ends the word of grew order and threat on Christmas supplys.
At the Friday evening signatures meeting, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" from this agreement after several negotiations meetings, started Thursday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators were left on Friday morning, with the hope of signing the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had locked the door.
But there was still more than six hours from a meeting starting at 11.00 p.m. that everyone would agree and that at 18.00 p.m. the text would be signed.
The conflict "which would have been very damageable for businesses" and "It was to be afraid that he had come to disturb the end of years", said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides an increase in salaries by 4% for lowest salaries (in local and regional road transports) and 2.9% for highest (international transports).
In time, for the lower salaries, "below EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not a big thing, but we're part of very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Whether we are going to order our soldiers that there are no blocks, no blocks of the centres of ravitalisation.
But we can always have some recalcitants that are not satisfied, he's got.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "good agreement", even if it was "difficulty to conceive increases on high salaries accounted for international competition".
According to him, increases will be 170 euros a monthly order for lower salaries and 100 to 120 euros for highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for the salaries, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides the revaluation of the 3% displacement costs and the general state holding of road transport at the first half of 2010, which will enable, in particular, to address the question of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective Convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that a decrease of 100 million euros of patronal charges was subject to a government amendment to the draft corrective funding law for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first time to enterprises associated with this organization, and in the second time, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Work.
It will be "in the shortest time", Mr. Bussereau assured.
Opposition of patronal organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR stated a "dupes market" because the 100 million euros "has already been promised in the sector for a part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of Transports has forced us to negotiate in the urgence, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but to not oppose the eatings from the next wake up, Unostra deployed.
For the other part, the agreement arises to "grave the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, more syndicates of the RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, the biggest transport line in a commune city in France, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday meeting between the RATP syndicates and the RATP direction left them on their famine as regards their premium request.
Samedi and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10 and 20:00, due to a train on two on the central tronch (in the Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central tronch.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travelers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, waiting for 200,000 clients every day, enjoyed the fact that "the RATP makes efforts to deserve the large stores".
The RER A cross the west is Paris's agglomeration.
The short RATP crown of Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Valle.
Wednesday, about a train on two was at the point hours, and almost no branch in hours buried, as planned.
As Wednesday, there was no cow on which the French were organized.
So at the short morning, the Station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usually, especially because of the absent of schools and schools.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that "a 30-hour before, to be sure to come at the time".
The Saint-Lazare gare did not know of saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had planned a framework for agents and forces of the order.
The RER A operated by the SNCF in or to Cergy-Le-Hauut, or went from the Saint-Lazare garage to join the metros.
New general assemblies of groves will be held on Saturday and Saturday, which will examine the results, "maigres" judged by the syndicates, of a meeting with the following Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, carrying out etc.
This is not what the drivers want, who claim a due premium, Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its proposals of premium between parentheses, the CGT was injured, highlighting that "the direction was not fixed to solve a problem while it was done in the roads and the SNCFs."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the terms of exercise of professionals", stated the RATP.
What did also say to the syndicates that the company was "making out of the week-end users".
On the morning, approximately 150 drivers had an invasion committee in Paris.
It was then that the direction, which still had any discussion during the greenhouse, had suggested the meeting "in anxiety" in an affair.
The conflict threatens to extend to the RER B Tuesday, after the departure of an advice by Unsa and independents.
Syndicates request a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros with 30 variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Individual) and complain about degradation of work conditions on this line to a million daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of the carrier, affect 2.200 to 2.700 brute euros and 600 to 650 euros of premium for decayed hours, Fridays and Fridays.
Turkish justice dissolved by the pro-curde party, decisions of serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court proposed the dilution of the main Procured Party of the country on Friday, a decision immediately followed by anger manifestations in the Kurde community, south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may be very complicated by the Government's task, which has just been handed to the Kurde community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Partie for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of damageable activities to the State and to its Indian unit," the President of the Court of Hasim Kiliç at the end of four days of debates.
The decision was taken at the unity of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the solution, Mr. Kiliç stated that 37 of the frameworks of the party, including its President Ahmet Turk and Mr Aysel Tugluk, were banned of political life for a period of five years.
The Court also announced the raising of the parliamentary immunity which Mr. Turk and Mrs. Tugluk were benefited and the confiscation of the Party's goods.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the sentence that the Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentary without label.
The decision followed by a procedure by the Prosecutor of the Cassation Court Abdurrahman Yalzinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP to obey the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observers believe that DTP is the political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that he has no "organic links" with the PKK but calls for this terrorist organization and calls the government to negotiate with him.
The Court ' s sentence is intervening when the Government has just taken hands to the Kurde community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to deploy the support of the Kurdes to the PKK and to end the conflict.
The DTP leaders claimed that a dilution could lead to a recycling of pressures in the south-east Anatoly, where many manifestations against the conditions of the PKK Abdullah Öcalan head's detention have been degenerated in hours with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of manifestants gathered themselves before the DTPs in Diyarbakir, the large city of South East in most Kurdes.
The forces of the order dropped lacrymogeneous grey and used water canons, while manifestants launched molotov cocktails or stones with branches.
Hundreds of people also manifested in Istanbul.
According to the sentence, Mr. Turk claimed that the decision of Justice was to "prolong the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question (curd, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic Mountain, also deployed the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closing of parties.
This is nothing, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total tolerance of the government's democracy opening, commented by the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Obviously, we can expect a reaction from the PKK.
Thursday, the PKK revoked an attack that killed seven soldiers three days ago in the north of Turkey, one of the most murdered months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a nice winter.
However, the responsibility for the road deploying and sablating service (FES) is well indicated that it is not for citizens.
It is just so that agents can test the vehicle technology and control them well.
And according to the meterologists, that could be well for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and snow.
The FES follows a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as he began to deny the city of Francfort and that the temperatures descended below zero, large sablage vehicles park 20 main roads (A) .
This includes big streets, main arteries, such as the New Path and the Hanauer Landstraße.
They also include pump access, common transport travellers, pitton areas and roads, such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three hours of the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 km of surey must be salted with a good road foundation, in 3 hours of time.
That is why the FES service starts at 3:00 a.m. "to the roads be delayed on the start of the trade of daily divisions".
There or it becomes more difficult, it's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 a.m.
This causes problems, tells us the responsibility for the deflaying and swallowing of the roads, "for no cars are ready to leave the salary vehicles".
Then, if he doesn't snow anymore, we take care of access and dessert paths - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come finally.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always provides a few complaints.
At five hours of the morning, the FES's pedestal team is on the road to prioritize dangerous areas and passengers.
As regards lockable tracks, FES services are usually not able to take care of it.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Francfort to monitor the state of ponts between 22 hours and 4 h30.
As the verglas forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salt vehicles will enter as soon as the temperature descends from 2 degrees below.
It also occurs that the police makes call for this special service as soon as needed.
The edge of the dinosaures
The Tawa Hallae was like other carnivor dinosaures: this bipede measured about 2 meters long for 1,50 meters high, its later members were powerful, its long crown was formed with acetic and rearmed teeth, his short arms ended by faháila grips, and he had a long cup.
If this species had v° a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But as the Sertling Nesbitt report of the Texas University in Austin and its teachers in the magazine Science of Thursday, Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaures containing these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made part of the lands of the supercontinent, Pangee and was to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the coverage of Tawa lights the evolution of the first dinosaures.
In fact, he emphasizes us about parental links, distribution and characteristics of these last ones.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt entered fo's association with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Natural History Museum of Utah and member of the fo's team ra that they sometimes came to find a twelve oxen in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary bed dating from Trias.
The scientists realized very quickly that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The fo's have updated the rest of five specials.
A discovery that confirms the theories on the beginning of the evolution of dinosaures.
The researchers baptized him by the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the God of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander at the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, however, it makes it possible to confirm certain theories on the beginning of the evolution of dinosaures.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaures appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, which makes it very difficult to classify all first dinosaures.
Experts ask themselves at the time when Saurians were divided into three major groups of development: therapides (carnivors) which include tyranazyre and velociraptor appeared later and which descended by birds, sauropodes, square-foods, and those appearing to them and ornithish herbivors whose species are part of such triceratops and stegosaurus.
According to S. Nesbitt and its studies, Tawa is one of the first thermopodes.
This species presents an interesting report of characteristics both primitive and developed, says Mr. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indications that allowed to think that the Tawa Hallae had small air bags in its bones at the corner level, as well as birds who are the descendants of the thermopodes.
These small air pockets facilitate the respiration of birds compared to mammifers.
It is that at the Tawa Hallae, the vertebras were also partly filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theroposes presenting small air bags in its bones.
Since the apparent line of the large sauropades had also air sacks and a ossature, they may think that their common grandfather already had this beneficial innovation.
Three follow-up waves to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaures with viová in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Thus, the three large lines of evolution were divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world, that is, the inheritance of lands that formed the supercontinent Pangee.
This is confirmed by the fact that the Paleontologist team also covered the remains of two other therapies that are not particularly apparent to him.
The three species can't descend from a common forefather who would have migrated, forwarding researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and coactor of the magazine Sciences said that there would have been at least three waves of Property to North America.
Some contradictions have been heard.
Martin Sander, paleonologist in Bonn, says there is a even older species, the silesaure, who lived in the present Poland and belonged to a group apparent to dinosaures.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there are a large number of dinosaures fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are almost no other continents.
However, how did the dinosaures become the dominant thetrapode of the secondary era while they proved to be a relatively rare line of reptils, there is still a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, the dinosaures shared their habitation with many other reptils, for example with the predecessors of the current crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
At the end of Trias, the dinosaures shared themselves on the entire planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which appeared to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
However, such success is not internal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a massive extinction to which the dinosaures had survived randomly while other reptils had disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaures were better adapted and thus could eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not external.
150 million years later, the fall of a favoral meteo for the development of a group of animals that had also developed during Trias and who lived in the shadow since that time: it was mammifers.
Vienna's solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatures worldwide.
There are teachers of the University of Toronto, the University of Cambrio, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are course loads from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edimbourg, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brême.
The evacuation by the Casino police at the University of J.W. Goethe of Francfort makes the walls on the whole planet.
278 teachers and teachers of the University of J.W. Goethe, but also other higher educational institutions in Germany, Europe and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Campus Westend.
In a German and German statement they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the Director Committee of the University.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Mıer-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers after walls and works of art had been graphified.
Five students were hurt during evacuation.
Signators believe that degradations did not justifie "a so violent intervention from the police order against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is a "inacceptable achievement" for the freedom of research and education.
The focusing attention on vandalism acts is only to "delegize and criminalize protest" and try to forget the reasons for mobilization.
Thus, the University Committee submitted debates that would still be essential.
The course loads require that the criminal proceedings be suspended immediately.
Most employees did not participate in degradations.
Legitimation of protests
Youths of the Green Syndicat of the Services Sector and the German Syndicates Conference (DGB) are solid students.
Protections are only the expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the Youths of the Green Syndicate.
As regards the Ministry of Sciences of Hesse Eva Kähne-Hörmann (CDU), she took and caused the action taken by the President of the University and Police.
We thank the President of the University.
All employment and degradation of places is completely inacceptable, said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the current television time.
We understand the sense of protests, but we do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
Parliamentary groups of SPD opposition, Green and Left (Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painting walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler from the Party La Left (Li¤)
Instead of meditating on the arguments and reckonings of students, they are evacuated.
The Partie La Left presented an invitation to the Ministry of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
During a long time, it was the secret city reputation, prohibited by visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of research of the secret Armament.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the community has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nano-electronic production and research sites are introduced there.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd's representatives have made connections with Riedberg, the place of French sciences – with university institutions and companys of the Centre of Innovation of France (FIZ).
There were reciprocal and midnight last meetings of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg.
The signatures were Moscou's mother Juri Rosljak's and Zelenograd's Prefect Anatoly ́imov for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz's head of the project section for Francfort.
In 2010, the representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
In contrast, Russian scientists want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutions and companies.
There is the Moscou Electrotechnic Institute, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Electronica.
The community was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation "Green City") draws its name of the rubbered in the hearts of which the research centres are implanted.
Project S21: a branch for Stuttgart
The width of the Stuttgart 21. project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its partners this is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want to. S21, it is much more than the enhancement of a railway garage, more than a colossal building project that will flourish the heart of the Bade-Wurtemberg capital, in a devastating chaos of chanters for a decade of years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Line heads, with roads that ended in the town, had the reputation at the time of being the rest of the 19th century transport technology that affected modern railway traffic sabots because there was a lot of time to make the lolomotives back to front.
It's what we need to do.
That's why the line heads must disappear: in Francfort and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train travel garage, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have not been long-termly compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost was exorbitant, to enhance the garage in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavière.
In fact, line heads have no more input and output problems since there are modern trains, reverseable with auto- and pilot cars at the two ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now launched by the new trace of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and Communal Policies have taken it.
The railway company is part of it, because it is the contributing costs of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the company.
From urbanistic view, this project is relatively well justified.
It is obtained a city space that, if the graphics of the planner generated by a planner, will be very green.
For the railway transport system, S21 is weak.
The passenger and the extension of the section are designed for a trafficking of people - and it is typical in the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition for good flights yet.
Modern traffic policy should be focused on the strengthening of trade in goods because rail transport is much more respectful than by carrier on the road.
But the new trace, with its inclinations, does not fit for good trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious about indirectly many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Subabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts think that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade, that money will be missing for other points of joinment and engorgement in the network.
The list of the Transport Minister is mentioned in all sixty large projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhin valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987, this line has been built to relax.
It would really be urgent to support the champignon.
But project S21 has the effect of a frenage sabot.
The roadway of the Rhin valley is able to become the trading goulot of international goods, which is in the whole heart of Europe.
The Government examines the sentence of airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the country stressed the possibility of calling for the Court of Justice of Hesse on the prohibition of aircraft by night.
The Minister for Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had charged experts to review the judgment made by the Court of Justice and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Cassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project for the North-West landing track of the Francfort airport would be carried out.
The attractment for 17 plans between 23 and 5 hours of the morning, as the Government of the country intends, is not compatible with the protection of citizens against the nightly aircraft.
Coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make a case against the sentence.
The critical opposition of this time and attempts to press the representative of the Government in order to make that survey to the Federal Court of Justice of Leipzig.
The leader of the Parliamentary Group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before elections, which consisted of prohibiting night flights. Otherwise, it will be constrained as a total lack of a given word.
It is sacraly difficult to be authorised to keep his word, said the leader of the Verts Tarek Al-Wazir by making the electoral slogan of the FDP "We have our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refuses Schäfer-Gümbel's reproche, which predicts that the Government of the country is attempting to swimming even night flights using "advocacy and roublardises".
It needs time to conduct a specific legal examination.
Coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of "the first quick print".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Mıer (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely irregular.
The United States banks recover the allocated aid
The big American banks, very touched by the crisis, are distorted from their linkes towards the State.
The Bank of America announced Thursday that it had completely recovered $45 billion ( more than $30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp salvation plan.
The American CNBC TV chain reported that Citigroup also intended to restore the aid received.
Thus, the institutions seek to dismiss imposed restrictions, which comply with the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonus assigned to the manager and the higher cost regulation.
Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital by sale of tickets to investors who reported to her 19 billion dollars of cost.
The rest of the sum comes from boxes from the bank that are well filled with the sale of several other sectors.
Last Wednesday, Kenneth Lewis, the General Bank of America, had expressly made thanks to the American contributors: the injection of capital has considered helpful to overcome a difficult period.
The institution had assumed its capacity by purchasing the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank to the strongest financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also intends to carry out money on financial markets in order to free it from the State's protection.
The United States bank could thus launch an increase in capital of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting environmental environments.
Citigroup's password did not want to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had recovered the public funds they had benefited.
Acceleration accelerated
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
Almost two weeks after the lying of the current editor head Nikolaus Brender, by the German ZDF Administrative Board, the following is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night for the nomination.
Peter Frey who managed the Berlin ZDF editor was the great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so that it would not predict the procedure.
However, there was also the will of the ZDF Markus Schächter's intention that the proposal would not be accepted by the Administrative Council.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needed a vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Administrative Board to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender for five years, but it was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council were declared favorable to Brender rebuilding and seven others had voted against.
In fact, the CDU, which is majority at the Administrative Board, had already allowed several weeks before the vote, would not want to renew Brander to its position.
This is Roland Koch, the President of the Hesse Land, who has organized a liaison against the head editor.
He had said that the contract of the very estimated editor was extended by invoking the fact that the ZDF information emissions were decreased under Brender.
That is why protests have still occurred, almost until the vote, with the increased political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 public experts who were involved in the debate and who believed that Koch's way was anticonstitutional.
But that wouldn't be done to anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 to 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the political sciences, the pedagogic and the Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Southwest (Rhenania-Palatinat radio bodies) and Frankfurter dschau (German national portrait quota).
In 1983, he became editor in the ZDF all over to the current magazine "height-day" ( Today's Journal).
Then his parking continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant of the main editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then to 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimensual information issue submitted in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the Foreign Policy Service of the ZDF and the Berlin editor.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected journalist of the year by the Medium Magazin specialized magazine, the Verts announced that they would have a constitutional complaint.
The Opponent of Koch to the Administrative Council, Minister of the Rhenania-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the proposals of the staff of the Intensity cannot be blocked by a part political majority.
Beck, however, does not intend to ask the relief of the political personalities of the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the follower of Brander, had deeply worked with the Administrative Board by criticizing the committee with vividity in its decision of lemoger Brander.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the main editor position without losing the face, as the Administrative Board could eliminate it without being suspected to put a political party at the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal from the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs decide to be more consistent: at a meeting between the Ministers and the Delegates of the Conference of Directors, a agreement was established to improve the conditions of work of the Bachelor students or Master's Master's work.
In the future, students should be able to end their studies.
In particular, they agreed to highlight the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow closing the selected study module.
Moreover, the labour burden should be reviewed to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher educational institutions want to facilitate the evaluation of the reviews between universities and foreign.
The countries also engaged in organizing more flexible common requirements for the branches of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one country to another.
Less Extensions
Since the beginning of the study protests in June last, the Ministers of Education of the countries and universities directors have been expressed in the mode: "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression takes a specific meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of reviews: "Every module should normally be able to be concluded by a single review," can be read in a document of 30 pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, states that by decreasing the burden of the reviews, the depreciation should be able to stop the depreciation, which would be deteriorated in consideration of studyability.
The "studiability" should be the key criteria for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as the background must be examined carefully to see if it is not possible to avoid this feeling of disturbance that sometimes we feel in the choice of courses.
Hambourg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is responsible for determined trooping.
Students should " have the opportunity and margin of work necessary to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will involve access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recreditation" every 5 years, which means, however, that only in 2015 all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies on the engine of the Federal Territory which depart from the accreditation council created by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exercised a certain pressure on the countries so that they would be affected by the agencies so that the programmes were not too loaded and the system of reviews was not too strict.
In some countries, universities and high schools have already heard with their regional ministers to take appropriate measures.
Renania-Palatinat is still the only country who has granted its agreement to provide more means for the development of the Bologne process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorielset programmes to strengthen pedagogical orientation offices and review offices and international relations
The countries and universities provide for this a budget of 10 million euros.
Beginning 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament a amendment to the law on higher educational institutions.
Following this, only one examination will be required to clore its studies.
The organisation of studies must be more flexible, and it must also be able to ensure the highlighting of notes from other higher educational institutions and the access to Master should be simplified.
From the end of the next year, the "studiability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition re-debated the question of the conditions of studies in the country.
The decisions have been appreciated, but critics have been heard.
The Federal Chairman of the Union of Socialist Students stated that he would wish that the organization of educational policies would no longer take place in the future "by the closed doors" of the Ministers and universities directors.
Later after the educational greenhouse, students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future diplomates from higher education are supported by the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Directors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of our students is very useful" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the countries with which the HRK works on a common reform project.
For the Syndicat of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn are not far enough. It requires the right and opportunity for each diplomatic Bachelor to enter into a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Director Committee, asks the countries to ensure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places for studies in Master and as well as possible.
The countries must therefore carry out more course loads.
Instead, the Ministers of Education did not refer to the possibility of accessibility to Master.
More than one page-based note on Herta Mıer
This is by these words “Arrête in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that begins a work of the Poet Werner Sîner, in which he temates in the bribs of trooping phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost his language territory at the same time.
Werner Sōner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was a German professor and of age in Bucarest and then a collection director in a youth editor house before installing in Francfort on the face.
Sõner received various literary prices; in 1993 he held the very convoided poesi chamber of the University of Goethe de Francfort and since 2002 he was director of the Hesse literature forum at Mousonturm's artist house in Francfort.
He made many talks about him in the last March non-literary circles, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "The German Library in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Safety dossiers".
Visiblely destabilised and geneated, Sõner made a declaration in which he recognized before his German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informator for the Security Police.
Sõner received the price of Germany together with some of the participants in 1989.
Insurance tests have started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concluded by Sõner, “that is someone who has not enough to resist the intimidation of security”.
Werner Sîner Poet is the Walter Infoer (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honouration of the Nobel price for Herta M ́er and its exemplary literary letters with the mechanisms of the power of dictature, the literary scene is spread, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that shows the abdomes and the lowness of a political system based on police monitoring and spinnering.
Werner Sõner is, as we can say according to the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Safety case, IM Walter played a role, assured the library expert Michael Markel after the confession of Sõner and returned to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interfered in his favor.
“He could have taken it out of all difficult situations at the time”, according to Markel.
Markel felt moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Sõner made his statement and was unexpected before this public, however, he had an ancient dissident of his detention with Roman secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the Security Spions already wrote Herta Mıer in July in the "Die Time", after reading the 914 pages of its own document.
It may be that the victims would have made speculations and sometimes have believed what real names were hidden last by the names of the loans Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where the consultation of Stasi's dossiers is a reliable process, the attitude aimed at the inheritance of security dossiers is still very confused.
A systematic lighting has been permanently counterloaded and released in the past years.
Only in 1999 a national advice corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work in the Simulation of Safety Archives (CNSAS) but the refund of the dossiers has been replaced since.
Since 2005, there is a law which defines the management of archives.
The influence of ancient members of the Security members in Romania is confirmed by the interview of an elder responsible for the Security of the Temevar who, after announcement of the Nobel Price release to Herta Mâer, expressed three disappointments in respect of the laurate.
She had a psychosis, and finally it was asked only once.
The inflammation of power thought to be able to express himself here, without any gene, under the cover of the freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable issues are associated in the case of Sõner how this happens so often in a hidden context of guilty.
Why now? Who has been spolied? The weighted reaction of the auditors, having Sîner, lets hope that the follow-up of this chapter will be more defined by a thief to know than by shame and feeling of shame.
On the Genèse of Herta Mıer's work, who received the Nobel price yesterday, it is more than a note below.
Tumultes at the League Champions
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, cut to four eyeles coming all rights from a Christmas sympa festival, on which the manufacturer of sport articles had set his goods when the new trainer VFB Christian Gross got at midnight the fourth in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag of the supplier at hand.
The man, whose crown was aware of, left to be conducted in the city that was still alien to him.
Otherwise, our fifth-quarters could have taken himself the flight – he hadn't drunk alcohol and wasn't even drunk of happiness.
He had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it had to take the job back.
Because it's now that it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had already been engaged three days earlier were: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in the ligue of champions through our 3:1 against Uria Urziceni de Romania" but we must not let us be weak by success. It will be a brutal fight to not return."
The "great work" waits for us on Sunday.
There it is to repeat the results of the campions ligue at daily.
And weaknesses must be overwhelmed after the three missionary goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Outside tissue
The eighth end of the League Champions (match to 16./17. + 23./24 Fev日/ match return 9.10. + 16./17. March) will be released to Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the luminous entrance of the follower of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only with the one who had brought chance, who had transmitted to Stuttgart's destabilised professionals, an unfair motivation and enjoy playing.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they deeply looked on their hotels, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plombing of the players" – Gross - the receipt of the success that sounded so well that did not do any more effects with Mr. Babbel.
He started a certain magic, acknowledged Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babbel, "in the foot when there is a new impulse, sometimes happens things that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for wounds, progressed in the range of the best player through its dynamics, tried to describe the "fenomène" found by a proverb "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who goes to action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the present situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, watching the Horst Heldt manager
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are able to overevaluate the victory against a completely overwhelmed defence and weakness of Roman guests.
They also had won in Glasgow before they had four days later a bad wake up in Leverkusen with the 0:4 objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had reached one of the season objectives but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't passed the hard head yet.
That Heldt the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to feast, even after the first victory at home for three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television interview of Jens Lehmann's purpose guard made rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take, and not Jens, would contrary Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerb criticism.
He had accused the weakness direction and said she had decided to change training under the pressure of public fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after his matches was deleted.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness ” and he called out the consequences for the guardian.
They were not able to become friends of life anymore.
In all cases, they agreed for all other things, namely, that without the preliminary work of the group by the replaced trainer, the high sporting and combating representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part of success" retorned Heldt and Lehmann in heart – and even the man in the plastic bag bought.
The world's championship heavy weight
Heavy fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson's challenges caused the Vitali Klitschko world campaign without prejudice.
But after twelve hard rounds, Ukraine defended its campaign title of the world's weight of heavy weight, according to the version of the WBC Federation.
In the unity of the judges, he has the points.
Hambourg – Vitali Klitschko keeps his title of the world's campion of hard weight.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year campaign had won a victory at the uniminity of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honesty since his comback on the scene in October 2008.
Earlier, Ukraine had already received the campaign title of the world of WBO and WBC Federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed the waiting KO.
Klitschko, 39-fold winner in 41 professional fights, has confessed two times his defect due to wounds.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first deficit in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted especially to dictate the fight, from the top of 2,02 metres, by its left.
Johnson, of 11 metres smaller who, before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, has succeeded to avoid the shopping of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from joining his dangerous right.
Johnson, too actionful for a challenge, was especially trying to cross the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his coups only rarely reached the champion.
He is even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, he has exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenge had made a lot of voice in the capital of Switzerland before fighting.
He insulted Klitschko from the "zombie villain" that "is really unable".
Pene to Friday weight, the champion couldn't stop provoking Johnson by making him fall his sunlights from the nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory from Klitschko's comback.
Klitschko reacted during his fourth fight since his comback on 11 October 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had held the nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered the "sa" WBC cinture that he had previously abandoned without fighting.
This year, defense his champion title, he received the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
"I just shot in this battle and I'm in perfect form," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to meet the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is campaign of WBO and IBF Federations.
But this is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the big Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, carries the WBA cinture.
This year, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that had to happen in September.
It would be that his promotion company intended to play this match at Wembley stage in London.
The case of Kunduz
The frontal attack of opposition: the Chairman of the Green Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Defence Minister of Guttenberg of lying in the case of Affairs Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left (the Left) parties ask for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition reproached the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) that he had deliberately disclosed certain facts.
The Minister intended to "form a controversy" on the killing of two-citeral trucks in September, said the leader of the Green's Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the issue of information of the ARD "Tagesschau" chain.
That means he's lying.
The order to kill was granted to the total degree of the rules of the International Security Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in principle, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Wednesday, new media revelations, the impact goal was in reality, not to destroy the furnished trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the OTAN investigation report, 142 persons were killed or wounded during the American aircraft attack, which had been taken on the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Verts, the SPD and the Left prayed Saturday to the Angela Merkel (CDU), to pronounce themselves in the shortest time before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and its part of the Verts Renate Künast believe that Mrs. Angela Merkel must say whether the target massacre strategy is part of the Federated Government's Federal Policy if the Channel, Army and Information Services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's portfolio rejects these criticisms.
The Channelary has not affected the military interventions in Afghanistan, said.
Samedi, the votes were stronger to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the State Secretary Peter Wichert, as was presented by the Minister.
According to the SPIEGEL magazine, the information they had sent to Guttenberg on the attack of the citizen trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have disimiluted the existence of the NATO report and hidden some details to the Minister.
In the surroundings of the two high officers, however, they have informed the Defence Ministry of the existence of several reports, including two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter General Sonntags Zeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested in a court to clarify the facts.
Until now, it has not received an answer
Samedi, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these discussions and sent back to the Federal Parliament's investigation committee that would be the next Thursday in order to bring light on the facts concerned.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, all wake up, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is only psychic diseases, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As soon as these phenomena appear during the sleep, everything is very good.
When we are located in our ashamed rooms, we can be surprised without prejudice to dreams and most foolish fantasies.
However, who, wake up, makes the dream status experience, hears and sees things that others don't understand, has the reputation in our west world to be foolish or drugs, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices appear only in psychological diseases or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is concerned: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to build houses, draw tables or write romans, but sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, foolishness and reality.
A conscience of awake, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most different forms, in the best cases it is called visions, the worst of foolishness.
But even if the dealer and the effect are distinguishing, the visions of the mystery Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Carlos Castaneda Prophet, the second states of fires, psychosis and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delires when the balance, neurotransmetric substances of the brain - firstly dopamine, norradrenaline, serotonine and acetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complicated hallucinations and delivering thoughts are very often shown during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly attraction force has no power on the person anymore.
Since oldness, philosophers and doctors have always seen the relationship between foolishness and dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations were a form of a wake-up dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatric, founded in 1861 "a great similarity between foolishness and dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, delires and sensor illusions that composed it".
We are in automne 2001 when Henning T turns into person of a drawn band.
His body is in two dimensions of the created colors.
The earthly attraction has no power on him anymore, it plans at the floor race.
He feels a shot.
After him, the devil's creatures, grimsing, the mouth's insulted, showing the teeth.
They pursue it, give him shoes of feet with heavy flaming bottles, throw it up against the walls, feel pain in the whole body.
Tonitrusting voices, bad voices, hurling, out of walls and radio.
He can't support these voices that insult him and humble him anymore.
Henning T. draws two cabs from his stereo chain, actually a bull and attach it to a crochet fixed on the floor.
He goes up on a baffle and goes around the neck.
He's running.
The bullet's off.
Let this use you a lesson, call the voices in a heart to throw his timber. "Go to a clinic and take care!"
Today, Henning T. at 40 years, he had six water psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was launched by the LSD.
It is also maniaco-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his sickness, he has been married for three years.
Psychosis I have seen terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
A percentage of the population suffers at least once in its life of schizophrenie; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenie, the persons concerned can no longer distinguish between the internal and the external world, they are in a hyper excitation state, which makes it possible to suffer hallucinations, megalomanie, relative foolishness or perseverance.
It is very hard to hear voices – voices commanding, commenting or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscience is noised under feelings.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the exclusions to a marble of ideas and fantasies from the deepest beds of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, the Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatric department of the CHU de Heidelberg (General Psychiatrie in Universitysklinikum).
The skizophrene is in the center of the situation, with a meaning focused on it.
At the same time, he is in a positive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why skizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awake is excluded.
Make experience once in his life of hallucination.
In the difference of dream, Fuchs, "the sensoral and spatial structure of the reality that is recorded during psychosis is preserved".
The delivering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alignment of the v° is held in a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles, is still an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to the moment lose the perception of reality, Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There is a genetic provision for schizophrenie, but studies on jewels showed that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the persons concerned have inflammated brain lesions.
The neurological maturation of the brain is supposed to be disturbed at a previous stage of development, for example by a mother’s viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what still remains unexplained is the way the anomalie of the neuron system occurs and increases the fact that it is not manifest for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatising experience may be a psychotic debugger, however.
Similarly, hallucinogene drugs can cause psychosis because they act on neurotransmittors.
When our brain is hot.
What's crazy, the professor of psychology, Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take honest medicines to avoid it while others buy strong drugs to purchase it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a question of view.
Kasten rassen for ten years of the reports on hallucinations and illusions: last year he has performed his results in a work titled "The Inreal World in our head".
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phénomènes of psychoses but also of a impressive number of many other pathologies.
It includes psychical disorders such as borderline or depression, but also . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is surprising to find that, in some conditions, even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, the Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take forms when brain areas that treat sensoral perceptions are hyperactive or not quite refreshed; when our brain is heated but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can start this status as a brain lesion or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of the participants recognises that at least once in his life has made the experience of hallucination.
In 2005, Sarah K. at 16, she lives in a small city of Mecklembourg-Pomerania and goes to school.
A young girl who makes it normal to say true.
If there were no images and voices.
Pen of the recreation, it comes to him that a young boy, sweet, to the long hair of the cattle, addresses him the word.
When she answers her friends looking at her, she's surprised – no one else sees or doesn't guard this boy.
They think this tired girl is a lunatic dream but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's wake up, listen and see this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting near her on the face.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds that young simpathy.
I'm crazy, she's sometimes wondering.
But she knows well that this young and other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
The night the appearances are generally scared.
The visions often are hard.
When she's in class, she's not able to follow the course because the teacher's just being presenting a new ≥ in her eyes and ears while it's in-a for the others and that the teacher is explaining equations in the table.
The night the appearances are generally scared.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish if she is awakened or dreamed already, if the images she see, the grimming faces or the girl with bloody intels on her arms and the feet are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me be quiet, she's crying to these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, but they would take her for a fool.
Automne 2009. Sarah K. was today 20 years old.
She had her last year and lived with her friend.
Hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since she has entered Internet contact with the Kasten psychologist she knows very well she's not crazy.
Fornication is also an artist of desperateness.
When someone is socially isolated or has not enough stimulation, the probability is that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I guess the brain is not busy enough, so that there is an animation.
Sarah K., the unique girl, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations as she learned at 13 years of age, that the man whom she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not her true father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real sounds and real sounds, therefore it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", > Kasten "is in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they are so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not generally distinguish from water psychoses.
In contrast to schizophrenes, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasms are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world, we have a quick tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathology, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapie of the Florence Nightingale Hotel in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, of creator - foolishness is a work of art of desperateness.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience of dictate irroid, a special form of the change in the conscience wake up by the dream.
Onionroids are very complex dreams that are considered real by the one who lives them and that it cannot distinguish from the dream even when it is in awake.
Oneroid consciousness is manifested during a traumatism or in extreme pathology situations as for patients with polyradiculopathie who are fully conscious are experienced by a motor paralyzing.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a complete and sustainable incapacity of moving, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, his own imaginary world that is divided from reality.
It's a mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change is happening but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is actually an intense form of means and interpretation, in an incomplete situation, an organizational ability that is given to us men, not to shade in the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, artistic historian, also describes his unionroid experiences in his book "Heart Changing" as an action of safeguard.
He is 49 years old, when his conscience is part of a trip for several days after the operation of a cardiac valve followed by a transplant; during that time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in reanimation.
It sees an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his head watching for his health.
He lives in the middle of age among the nobles that produce blood-based drugs.
It is removed by a Greek moto who brings it into his country, surrounds with his hospital bed in the Alpes news and met a Korean mafia.
He absorps himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
Accordingly, these internal travels distinguish from any dream.
The dream is a very different state, he writes by describing what he has.
In contrast to dreams, memories from mental travel are very clear and very detailed for years later.
We can even say that they are much more different and more intensive than the real v.
The intensity of this v makes the horizon of our other daily experiences, the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneroid deals, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how difficult our internal representations of external reality are even in the sight.
Any change in the state of conscience, the physician Kasten summarises "can cause deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that can also be very rich.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years, children will follow the edition house.
The nomination of Kallen at the PDG of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in longer term, Hubert Burda wants her two children to represent the press group, said Spiegel.
The holding must remain at 100% a family company.
Hambourg - A long term, the editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years and are closely determined to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All the details were advanced.
The question to know if they will be active in the company will then be asked.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able.
It is not possible to impose their children to 7500 assemblers without knowing whether they are able to take care of them.
This would demolate children as well as the company.
Burda had told the last Thursday that he would leave from the post of the President-General from January and that his follower was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, is a member of the Administrative Council since 1999.
He was very responsible for the sector.
Then he took care of the Sector Trésor, that he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhaver's department, he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, this is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children have 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, was dead a few years ago.
The nomination of Kallen also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda indicates that holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in the families that have been left by a capital bulimy, which have made great unfortunate speculations thinking that they might still be able to grim up.
This has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, said Burda.
I am not absolutely in the role of the country's preceptor as it could be Springer, and I do not intend to be part of such international links such as Time, these companies took too much importance.
Integer beauty
Everything you can wish, in the field of beauty and well-being, at hand.

Innovation and Property have been the words of this city spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 to 22:00.
Miscellaneous decollates
Christmas approaches and it is never superflu to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our holiday guard.
The form of collection, very important to evaluate silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The songman Fergie has chosen an exagered and very complicated collection. This is not very advised.
Endsa and Barcelona, from the electrical car
The Endsa Electric Company, in relation to the Barcelona Ajuntament, created the "Live Office".
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The 'Oficina LIVE' (Logistic for the Implication of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road fe for the implanting of the electric car in the city and set agreements on mobility, by performing approaches, coordinating, with subventions, etc.
Furthermore, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electrical car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to start what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric towns"
But Barcelone is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are coming to the project.
It is three towns selected by the Government in the framework of the MOVELE Plan to launch the engineering of the electric car.
Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalogue Generality.
It aims to promote research and development activities in the Catalogue autonomous Community.
Among these are energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that endsa participates in the promotion of electricity car.
The company participates in standardization groups at European scale and has an additional projecting, such as G4V, ELVIRE or VERDE CENIT.
Zapatero interviews “a future of peace” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, interviews “a future of quietness” for the Spanish car industry, which, as mentioned, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Government's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reminded the measures made by the ex-effective during the year to support the car sector.
"without the Car Competitiveness Plan, we would now have a landing of leave, closing some of our main production sites," said the Government Chairman.
"Through this plan and the decision of the marks to remain in Spain in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of quietness for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he said.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Car Sector (PIA), dedicated 800 million euros to 19 producers and 137 assisting companies, which mobilized a investment of more than 3 million euros.
The leader of the ex-effective explained that this investment was also intended for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on the governmental support measures for the application in the Plan 2000E, which was placed in collaboration with autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan allowed the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6 per cent and contributed to a "creasing" increase in the registration, which progressed by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 collection cars
Madrid receives the first edition of the International Collection Room, a meeting space for professionals and patients in the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition surface of 20 000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exponents will be presented.
Not only motorcycles and collection cars can be found, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind related to the engine world.
So, with the exhibitors of the packaging, we can find accessories, change pieces, components, textile accessories, supplements, reviews, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
However, the commercial activity of this room will also include parallel activities: races, sport exhibitions, ability tests, presentations and concurrence.
Facilities tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a surrounding circuit outside the exhibitions park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not corrupt with the respect of the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine stop and starting system, baptized i-Stop, a device that at least for instant, is available only on engine 2.0 at the basis of 150 horse.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note that it has received in her enemy.
Details, the end of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanism, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are notable on the new Mazda3.
In the beginning of the conducting post, it appears that the front seats have an excellent ethnomy and fixation.
The touching of the flight is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the enemy formed by the control and console table, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a future internal design, with many buttons and commands, and living colors in red and blue.
This reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that as well as Mazda3 as the Civic, both Japanese, contrasts with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, everyone wants to overcome.
Continuing with the habit, this Japanese compact car presents more habituality than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
This is a big coffre to regular forms.
The engine's auto-stop and starting system, at least for instant, is available only on the engine of two litres and 150 horses and with the manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. He illustrates himself by his fineness, his weak noise, his performances and control of his consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with essential engine, both for its great speed and for its controlled consumption.
About the equipment level, the selected model for the test is the Sportive, otherwise the one that presents the largest number of series elements.
Among the series equipment, the route change assistant (RVM) who removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensible internal mirror, the board computer on a large size, the stationing sensors, the independent climate, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, and the 17-pound alignment wheels are especially notable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Pack Premium which included, for more than EUR 1,500, the elements of the bi-xenon adaptable bars and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of materials used, by its behavior and by its high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not have much miles per year will be able to choose for the i-Stop version associated only with the engine of essence 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for Luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested model, Sportive.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
“First” Lux
L.A. covers the red non-carboned cup of penelope, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever blown, dressed as elegant as sexy for Nine output. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", so sophisticated as used, had chosen for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at his electronic court, without offering the possibility to see some types of joint parts or to navigate on the Internet.
He benefited from his five minutes of glory in the United States, when the magazine Time appointed it as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea → interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to the artphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and abonnement, or less than half what costs, for example, the iPhone abonnement.
With its success, the company launched two new devices: one design for Twitter, the other with a free life data service for six times more dear than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited as his grandfather, but it is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with an artphone already know what represents the fact of refusing data when a frontier is passed or unexpectedly seeking a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his court.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incroy · seduitive and it has long been to work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but I would need to have made a tess to understand them and good lunettes to read the small characters.
Remembers of the European Commission's repeated order to propose adequate roaming tariff throughout Europe have had a shortly comprehensive effect.
Outside of its country of origin, the data are refused to be used, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (is still interesting that it is called Fon while it does not have the Wifi) offers this type of tariff, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to restore their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and it is paid when it is purchased and not each month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option for purchasing with life access as Peek already proposes to the United States.
Not that I see buy it.
I'm looking at my court on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a representative presenting the same system.
The preferred color of Michelle
The yellow is, of course, the preferred color of the first lady of the United States.
If she came to Barack Obama's office at the presidency of the United States with a robe and a mantle of this color, she has actually chosen the same to join her at the second time, without doubt the most important of her life: the release to Oslo of the Nobel Price of Peace.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model in these two occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow drawing to green with reflectors, both times, the chair was composed of three pieces: dress, clothing and clothing, in the same weight, and was ornated of a large brodery or a haltier.
Although at the first time, the first lady of the United States would follow the silence of the Princess of the Ashturies and decided to submit the same detentions.
But the weight in which both weights are cut off makes them very different.
If for the use of function it was a spacious dance, however, it would bring a printed hair to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green glasses for the first occasion, and a similar, but gold model this time.
She also changed: Hairs are now lifted up while she brought them away.
75% of the working mothers have experienced professional problems because of their maternity
Labour discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what shows the study “Fecondity and career of women in Spain” conducted by the CSIC in employment with the Instituto of Women.
The investigation of 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years of age does not have any doubt: 75% of the mothers who worked have seen their professional career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences on the start of life in couples and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment.
Those who do not have any activities outside the house, work partly or have a little stable work, have a couple earlier, have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children.
However, women who have a stable employment, mainly in the public sector, reject the entrance in life in couples and first pregnancy, and have less children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of a fixed job have their first child, average 3,7 years after installing them in couples, and this number is 4.1 for those who work in the public sector. “The data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives for their lives, which led them to reject the union and the harvest of children.
Moreover, the type of employment exercised is largely influenced by maternity, but less than the date of common life beginning," explains the researcher of CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that increases the age of the marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, more training level is high, more they marry and have their first child late.
Differences are also held among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were relatively mothers for the first time 25.1 to 32.1 years in average.
“ Another discrimination appears also among women, depending on their study level.
While those who have done elementary studies are married and have their first child before finding a stable employment, those who have conducted average or higher studies reverse this programme and give the priority to obtain a stable job as a precondition for marriage and a child's argue, “lady Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oreal Paris has just put a new name in his zealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actor will incarnate the image of several products of the mark, toneing the universal design “Because I owe it well”.
The protagonist of Joyeux Christmas, one of the most legitimate shareholders of the international scene, thus comes to other collections recorded in the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope.
Before it, the last to pass in this selection club were Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonary).
In men, the cosmetics mark also accounts for luxe ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lections) and Matthew Fox (the Evangeline companion in Lost).
The prices of the British mode
Britains have much to say in the world of mode.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, gathered together for the annual release of their prices, which occurred in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose the best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's axis poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-fire of writers who have passed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He doesn't do it with the pre-approved and appreciated types (biographic summary, life and work), but seeking something similar to the nucleo of ignorance of the person created.
The travel is exciting and Vincent doesn't spare fears or lighting.
Nice to enjoy, this book is also an invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here a few instinctives.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulsation, almost that, even that I felt without name: pleasing against the funeral destination, moral without fault and innocentness without no god."
About Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, a allergic Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impugnation and ignorance, with a glorious poetic humor, denied of meaning, like the lame of the cow that failed to kill him. ”
On Graham Greene: “Our husband was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasts thirteen years, in the flesh of which he married the emotion of adulterer to enjoy the recompense, a spiritual privilege that consists of reaching heaven through the way of loss. ”
About James Joyce: “Ulysse was held in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters tops of the universal literature, which must be recorded by the north side, on which the best alpinists still leave and still take.”
About William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the inheriter of a land owner of the comte and other times when he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer collected the demenous cry from a pont by this person of Munch to bring his echo to the bottom of the 20th century, in his literary form, and put it into the flight of himself and calling the posterity with a violent speech to the asticots. ”
On Dorothy Parker: "Every day she began to knee and prayed: "God-love, I pray you to make me stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave, to Spenser were recorded: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the gate,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, suffered the deceased death."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her baggage, she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edouard VII had epiced it between the azalees or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen such a patient and loving man of a negross whose literary talent exceeded foolishness. ”
Sur Pío Baroja : "What does Martín-Santos do if it is trying to disimilate Joyce with Baroja?
What about Benet if it's not to make Baroja fuss by Faulkner?
What does this do if it is not to inspire the glory of this man to serve him of pedestal?’
A lot of agression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked in our quarter of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of youths spent between 15 and 18 years near her and our dog, a blood-melly, saved from the SPA and weighed not more than six kilograms, and without saying, they sent him two coups of feet that left the dog grewly wounded.
Our anger is big because we don't see what is fun to appeal freely to a small animal without defence that was also in defence.
This is the injury of a lady who was quietly walking and who, when she injured those individuals, came to fear for her integrity, because a energy that attacks a animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an older man or, finally, anybody weaker than him.
The episode takes place about 17 hours, a Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet quarter.
The dog's kidding all the day.
We have clearly heard a complaint to the Commissioner of the quarter even if we doubt that this is a majority and to avoid touching the difficulties, we just want to explain that the lakes were Spanish.
The indignation led us to declare that fact.
We don't understand what happens with youths so they find fun to deal freely with an animal without defense that gives us love, friendship and holds us company.
We don't know where the good education and respect of animals and people has passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, in the port of the cake
The Michalin Pneus Manufacturer, in relation to the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the cake gate, mainly with the younger motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
This initiative aims to be aware of the importance of the port of the cake, since it is the only protective element that allows to avoid head-shirts, or even death, if it is in two wheels.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was registered in the line of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of more safer products” and claimed that it contributed to this goal by other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new cooking campaign will be conducting a first phase during which shows will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the largest distribution.
Finally, Michelin highlighted that road security “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a two-rad pneumatic manufacturer, one of its main objectives is to develop more safer products.
The sale of commercial vehicles is progressive
After nearly two years, the commercial vehicle market begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 months of reduction, according to the numbers of the patronal syndicate of Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, the conceitionary.
However, the good news should be announced, since the reference to the comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the year.
Thus, despite the rebuilding of the last month, the registrations collected during these 11 months are 40% under the exercise.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of commercial vehicles (from tourism cars, pick-up, furgonettes, chassis cars and trucks were sold) 95 853 were sold.
The big clouds that most affect their request have not been so dismissed; even though they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium enterprises, paying in nearly 100% of the cases through external financing.
In addition to restrictions involved by the limitation of credits, other factors such as the employment rate or the persistence of the bad economic conjoncture must be acquired.
With regard to this situation and the difference of tourism vehicles, the aid to buy 2000E has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who want to purchase a commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was reminded of the need for the administration to attach special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (carriers and bus).
The conceitionaries provides a year 2010 similar to the end, for which it calculates a fall of wins (turism vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
Aid to emergency freezing is now obligatory
As this has happened with the ABS frequency locking system and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, the emergency breeding aid system will constitute a mandatory element on European cars.
In addition, they are already obligatory on tourism cars and commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a deficiency period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of petons, even if it may also, in its way of action, contribute to avoiding many back shocks.
The assistant in the emergency breathing acts by increased pressure on breasts in case of emergency detected by the system by the driver's feet.
But this last does not always keep pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car manufacturer, a third of the drivers involved in an accident could not have been able to support the rain before the station, and half of them did not benefit from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, requires the maximum of the brain system, reducing the distance the car needed to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 mortal accidents in which peatons were involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent emergency breathing systems: it is estimated that an insult on four with wounds would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting harmfully on the brain.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increased pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it doesn't react, and although the inevitable is, the device does the maximum effort to minimize damage.
General Motors repair the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the company Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be made during the first week of April – probably on 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the Northern American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to conclude the Opel secure plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, hears that each point of the plan has been approved by the parties concerned.
And this may include that the final document, which will be submitted to the workers then to the governments of the countries where the businesses are, is reported until the beginning of 2010.
However, in GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has put the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as quickly as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also encourages to buy Volvo, but the Netherlands Sport Car Manufacturer, supported by the Russian Group Converg, takes importance.
Where there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the Porsche Boxster Spyder flight
To design their last and precious beauty, Porsche engineers went from Boxster S and succeeded to start it with nothing less than 80 kg, which leaves the balance only 1 275 kg.
This led them first to pass from the automatic toilet that was replaced by a handly broken tower, which allowed them to reduce 21 kg, to use gates in aluminium like the GT3, 15 kg less, to remove the climate, 13 kg, to reduce the residue from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kg of winners, to increase sports, 12 kg, and with 19 pound pneumers, five pounds.
Finally, they revoked the CDR-30 audio system, thus wining six other kilograms and replaced the pool gates by weighted pounds, economying the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double box PDK, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountain, with particular torturous virages.
Its behaviour can only be qualified.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car to rotate on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary, it was a long time that we had not tested such a small and small model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the roads, including at high speed.
It's a small athlete, capable of escape his small muscle speed for the time necessary, until we asked him to spread, breathe, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as precisely, the car will do what our hands will induce on the flight.
And she'll do it with a chirurgical precision.
Voluntary Engine Sound
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is especially successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or using a system that changes the engine crash, already used on the Panamara.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at the delay or at the recovery.
Suspensions are closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The dressing of the roads we have parked with Boyxster Spyder was quite covered, but the car was well managed by the powder.
Electronic assistants have made a short presentation act on the whole road, while on some roads, we found worms in the morning and graves later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralegal car, most funny to drive and is much more than a simple change in Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70 831.
"Back girl"
Intima friendship of Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Cocoon line icon and occasional starlet of the house's slides, the song shows his face of a bad girl with so much content as his Chanel shoes.
More than a Bad Girl or It Girl is a "Bag Girl".
Basconia offers a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral received a triomph that was 91-82 on its visit to Maccabi Electra, despite the many absents of Dusko Ivanovic team. She was thus headed by her group, after the great spectacle of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight panics to three points, was the best of her team (29th evaluation).
Vitoria's team sucked to comply the important absents of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to get the victory.
Moreover, the big skill from the perimeter, with 16 pins at three points marked, broadly determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for blue and red, which took the benefit from the beginning.
The fact that the first four of Vitoria's team was marked since the perimeter, it was that they had gone on the Israelian land with the warm pointing.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from the 18-20 final of the first fourth hour.
The second quarter time was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by claims and appreciations to his old house to increase their benefit to break (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to note as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter was already allowed to predict that this night would not be the best of Brazil.
But in this truck, despite the fact that they were on the right road to the pause, nothing was played, far away, and the Avala team wanted to remember that Vitoria's that we won't so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they succeeded to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the benefit of the yellow (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic players, vulnerable but far from being dead, needed to carry out some of the ability to take air, and at this time the Mirza Teletovic mitraillet appears, which, with three conscious points and the help of England and Ribas, sends the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the sites succeed at the end of the third fourth time (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play everything for all the last time and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not leave anyone to take what they had deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic players did not predict themselves, defended themselves well, and even though the Israelites reproached themselves in the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory fled to Tel A for the first time of the season.
Wounds prevent Unikaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost bruyamly in Greece face to Olympias, and sent to him the head of the Euroligue B group, in a match marked by the unicaja players' absents, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), who facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not feared by the Pacific and Amitia pavilion or by the rival enverger, of course one of the most powerful Europe and having a large budget.
The first quarter-time game allowed you to dream the andalous. A aggressive defense and three pawns at three consequent points, two of Omar Cook leader and one of Guillam Rubio who exploded the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by Unicaja's intensity, although the arsnale of the local team with the inner Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, when a action, a bathroom beginning, between the Beverley-American minors and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to work by showing his supremeness in the two camps, while the outcome to hurt the Joel Freeland pivot and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were weakening on Unicaja.
Internal players and the Lithuanian ailer Linas Kleizas, with their three-point pairs, buried the benefit 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
Unable to mount
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the losses of 19, showed himself higher and even came to compare the division of the meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group's head changing.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absents and the last outcome of the Swiss pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, three points of Cook and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57 at the thirteenth and one minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because Olympiacos would be implacable when players pressed and showed their sustainability in metrometers in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, successfully resumed the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submits, accepting the victory of Olympias.
How much should you be paid after your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, using a new application of Trovit, the research engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How many you should be paid?" calculates the payments of users from more than 140 000 job offers that are available in Spain, from a Facebook form available, where you need to enter your profession, your experience years, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week the application works, the research engine has detected that, in general, the Spanish worker "founds badly recompensed" has explained in a question the responsible for Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its research engines to the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British informal programmer receives 45 226 brutal euros annually and a French, 31 059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 annual brutal euros in letters, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least rewarded work in Spain is the server, with 11 592 net euros annually, followed by the seller, with 14 725 euros, and the ova, with 15 667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are the driver, half-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya
The Brazilian Government set a time for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its ambassade of Tegucigalpa.
The Reverse Chairman will have to abandon diplomatic employment by 27 January 2010, date of the end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charged by Brazil's ambassador in Honduras' capital, confirmed at Globo TV that "Me" knows that he has to leave the ambassade, where it has been re-evaluated since 21 September before that date.
"He has a conscience that he must go on January 27, on the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former mandatary, who confirmed his intention to leave the ambassador before the time limit set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya phoned.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was chosen), Zelaya assured that he would remain in Brazil's ambassador until January.
However, on the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya had set up the political equivalent condition that would impose the Government of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the last days of the early days, during which the inflation of assets constituted the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty occurs again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in a environment where the agents make decisions on an uncertain future.
The medication used by the central banks to stabilise markets was to monetate the debt by direct purchasing of assets and indirectly by giving sufficient liquidity to close rates of zero, so that financial institutions purchase assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without repealing their non-conformist liquidity policy, begin to put a little sand in the roads, as did the ECB, with their adjudication for a year of the next week.
Therefore, investors are concerned about the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic renewal without erodoxed measures, and we are assisting increasing the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of bourses and divisions of business obligations re-increases, although they remain very remote from the paranormal levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been obliged to socialize the private risk and the debt is again affected.
There is again an enlargement to the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugees selected by investors, providing to increase the differences between the countries of the euro and Germany.
Spain was almost touched by this instability episode, but then the Standard & Poor'sa threatened by a new review at the decrease of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to cause the defensors of the moral risk, who tryed again to cause a case of consciousness in the responsibles of the world economic policy that had freed the destructive effects of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, while what it was to do is to determine a new day of thanks.
However, Dubai's situation is responsible for a tribal fight between the e's to restore its position to the power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissimulates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that covers the pot to the roses.
Prodi it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be absolutely irrational that Ecofin would save Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a Member State in the euro area to avoid compliance with its commitments.
Instead, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to transparency and makes its citizens compatibil with the need for extraordinary measures to maintain stability of its financial funds.
If, as we hope it, we are faced with a normalisation episode of transitional risk premiums, after some extent in high positions, it would be pre-.
In Spanish, as long as our divisions from the debt increase in the measure of European companies' obligations, we do not need to be concerned.
If the European divorces were decreased and ours continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our previsional indicators obligation the majority of studies to predict their repair models and to revise their previews for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not have much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the instant “dence is a mother of security”.
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán tricked for the press which he had stated before the subcommittee at eight cents.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 million euros until 2020 and 60 million more from that date to 2030, where nuclear centres are currently open.
If that is not the case, the necessary investment would not be 60 million but 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be dedicated to production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the issue will change, and it will have to increase power.
Its comparison is both on gas and carbon centres, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, especially, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW are more needed, with other "support energy".
Galan, who considers the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the Government has recently approved, is in the line of what it claims to be undertaken, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging national carbon consumption, which contradicts climate heating policies.
According to him, there is “a long-term pari” in this sense, despite the "pontual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola qualified them.
Anyway, Galan believes that the decisions to invest, although they are at the long term, must be taken, because they put a certain time before they reach their maturity and that a stable refunding framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a branch of Ferrovial for airport services on the ground, will play the privileged partnership role of the Irish airport company Aer Lingus for goods services in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, France or Brussels are part of the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Court of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol to create the Centre for Innovation of intelligent infrastructures yesterday.
The covenant provides a investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks in the centre will be to perform research on energy efficiency on autoways and airports.
Acciona disputes his first autoroute in Hochtief and Bouygues
Aciona fights for its first autoroute in conceition, on which it already works as energy and water manager.
The playing tunnel is estimated at $1.700 million (approximately $1 047 million).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief firm are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian town of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Aciona to be established in the country as public and conceived business.
The city's office wants to be able to have it for the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private Propertyation (PPP for its initials in →) to carry out the project, in the framework of a business plan under the Tutorial of Erns & Young, the local administration has already a list of finalists that will be loaded from the peague and the exploitation of the peague.
In wait for the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment is 1 700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European producers.
The Baptized Transcity group is conducted by Aciona, the only Spanish company in liss, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian producers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground travellers.
The Consortium Northern, with the presence of the British undertaking Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues Constructor Group.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (the branch of the German producer Hochtief, which is available at its tour of the ACP participation), another local company, Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galloese company specialised in the public travels, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large chantiers and privatizations, but it is a great difficulty, if it is not by the way of purchasing a local building undertaking.
A strategy followed by the Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, which have already been mentioned, besides their Asian references, and remains an unqualified step for Spanish gentlemen in the sector.
It has not been able to gain a place on this market by 30% of its participation in Leighton's owner.
Millionary assets
It focused on a geographical area of greater importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its energy provider and the destilation sector.
It has, among other actives, the largest park of eolians, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and has the grouping of engineering and management of Adelaïde dealers, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the building and infrastructure management markets.
The subterranean road, promoted by the Office of Infrastructure of Brisbane and Northern Link (Northern Light), is called to connect the west west-out of Toowong to the periferic road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce the traffic covering in Brisbane.
The term set by the administration indicates that the claim will take place during the summer 2010 and that the jobs will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this pigeway will be opened at the end of 2014 trading, it is not intended that the chain be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two ways, a electronic pige system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will offer $500 million Australian (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make a broad fruitage of Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the receipt of a contract with the government evaluated by 154 million.
The company detained by S will, through its local filial Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the high-speed national network in optical fibres.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has cedged the King George tour building project of 27 ages in Brisbane city. The travels have not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more precisely in Manchester, it will share the building and management of two school groups with Laing O'Rourke for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC seems to adjud a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine branch, is seen to adjudicate the construction of a tunnel of 2.5 miles long for an autoroute in Slovenia for 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract a few days after having seen the Bosruck tunnel increase travels for a total of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolides his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the sandwich is planned for beginning 2010 and its performance will take 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore seems to be adjudicated to Renfe's publicity
Renfe has granted publicity and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, stated the railway operator.
The contract refers to the possibility of two prolongations of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies who were presented in the Renfe's call, among whom four were finalists, including TBWA responsible for creativity during the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be loaded from the design and production of campaigns.
An amendment of 63 million in France Télécom to free the competition
The French competition regulator involved an amendment of 63 million euros in France Télécom for its competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the competition on a fixed and mobile phone by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by programs of loyalty to consumers in the field of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopol and still the state firm, has recovered more than 450 million euros in amendments since 1994 because of the obstacles he has put to his competitors.
The sanctions involving yesterday have also been increased because the authority that cares for competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and that it is therefore repeated.
A box of applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone branch followed the silence of other operators and opened a Internet application bucket, with a view to acquiring income that does not come from the voice transmission.
In the past, the box of applications of Orange will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions Ligue has reported 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions Ligue has become a source of income for the clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth place of clubs that had the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is headed on the list.
Manchester United is headed on the list.
Getting the EUFA Champions Ligue does not only bring glory, but it is also one of the main income sources of the large clubs.
In fact, the competition divided 5 362,5 million euros to 105 teams (12 Spanish teams) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created during the 1992-1993 session.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served at this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for his participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has received the trophee three times.
The catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cope in 1992, is fifth in the list.
The list head is Manchester United and the Bayern de Munich, the two teams who also made the most money for their participation in the last Champions Ligue.
And that, even though they lost before the Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in respect of the money reported by the Champions Ligue, although it has received more titles than any other (five, while Italy has received four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex monetary distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this year, the president of Michel Platini will win 1 090 million through the Champions Ligue.
From this sum, the EUFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in classing matches (including the Atlantic of Madrid) received 2.5 million.
Furthermore, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each dispute.
There is also a bonus in the case of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those coming in eight-year-olds receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive at the end of 3,3 million.
The last four teams will receive every 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, face 5,2 received by the other finalist.
So, under fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça emphasised 2.5 million for receiving the Super Coupe of Europe.
In addition, there are variable payments, which are dedicated to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important places and has four attracted places.
The year's campaign emphasises 40% of the affected money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group mentioned yesterday the details of the purchase offer of action which it intends to buy a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch an acquisition offer (OPA) for all the titles.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action, which will be deducted in 10 years and which will be paid at a rate of 1 % per year for this report.
Yesterday, Soss' actions ended at EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumasa's offer evaluates 18% under the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the nomination of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for the shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of tickets.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos firm claimed that she had contacted the regulator.
If it had happened, the delay would be 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos was 254.27 million.
Waiting, Sus continues to reactivate his direction.
In an attempt to stay outside of possible offers of purchase and go and come judges of his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Maria Luis Jordan as a leader of internal audit.
A decision that makes the first woman to take a job managing in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the President of the Group.
And it is not free of polemics, since the company remains in the legal battle for more than 230 million of Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sus reveals new fund declines during the next months cannot be removed.
As regards the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the decline of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorises Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Value Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the OPA of exclusion submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that he authorised this operation because he understood that its terms were adjusted to the existing standards and that he considered "suficient" the content of the explicit feed submitted, following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550 008 actions from Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per action, which represents 8.95% of the social capital, consisting of 6 142 786 negotiations in Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, he explained that 5 592 778 million actions were immobilized and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated that the price was fixed by Federico Paternina, to the provisions of the existing standards.
New car expertise tools
In these days of bad time and time, car garages are not the only winners.
Each day, thousands of cars that have passed an insult are returned to a garage, where a expert must evaluate the deficiencies and the cost of repair.
Each left is different, and the calculation of the costs of pieces and worktime can be a long and complex work.
Calculating the cost of a repair between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30, including workshops and hands may take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a question of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the evaluation of injury and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then to treat them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solera group, is the leader company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competitive companies in the field of evaluation and development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to be treated has not been discovered, even in the past five years, more versions, variants and motorisations have been acquired than during the fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies are working.
This is a very heavy work because each of the thousands of the vehicle must be catalogued and registered its price.
Furthermore, a "intelligent" graphical image of each model is set on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process is very quickly in progress.
If this is a smallly sold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Of the most exclusive models, for example, they have information on Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
The number exceeds 99 % in the case of vehicles in the carrier.
In order to carry out the documentation and development of the databases, Audatex has eight world-wide centres (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain marks.
The national seat is held in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than 100 technicians (generally mechanical experts) working on three computers.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge information flow allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer different products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but, depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of cash pieces or to calculate the value of a car.
The only company with a guide that points out the value of opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does it to the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that it can provide to the professionals of the sector.
This undertaking offers ten different tools, the pharma product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the evaluation of leathers, intended for experts.
There are cars, motors, industrial vehicles and hard vehicles.
Besides the cost of the pieces, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimation.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for clients who use it shortly at least ten times per month.
Then each insurance company, who performs thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is out of the mounting chain, only using its chassis number.
AudaGlass is on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to explore on epaves declared vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemography analysis or know coherent problems by mark or by model.
It is possible, for example, to study how many models of a specific mark have gone to the garage for a panel or how serious injuries have occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company who is dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, inter alia, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to parts, prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a enterprise of the Einsa Group, based in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the evaluation of injury, paints or devotion maintenance.
