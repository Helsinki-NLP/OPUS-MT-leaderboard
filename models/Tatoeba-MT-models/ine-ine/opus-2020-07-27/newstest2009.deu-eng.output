The Prager Börse is struggling against business closing in minus.
After the stealing waste morning, the Prager Borse could correct the losses.
The transactions with the actions of CHEZ reached nearly half of the normal daywork.
The Prager Börse joined at the start of the Tuesday work at the break from Monday, when they decreased for more six proposition points.
This time was the reason for the inbreak on the Wall Street.
Also in Czechland, the market reaction shows the result of the voting of the representative house that it had refused to submit a stability plan for the financial sector.
Case of action in Asia
One dramatic case experienced the actions at the season in Asia, although the index could compensate a part of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Börse in Hong Kong lost nearly four pro-points during the business stage, but later was able to make a part of the losses, so the decline was decreased to about 2.5%.
The Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, watching the movement of Chinese actions at the border in Hong Kong, was decreased by 3.8 Pro, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares in the bourgeois in Sydney lost more than five Pro, but then losses decreased to 4.3 Pro.
The bears in Taiwan were covered by 3.6 Pro.
"The timeing for the salvation action in the United States is uncertain and the financial markets will be affected worldwide," as the leader of the elector in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, though it belongs to China, its election policy itself, so independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The rates in Hong Kong move at the same level as those in the United States.
The legislators should, according to the words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, return to the negotiations as soon as possible and adopt the draft support of the financial system.
Others are threatened that other countries would have been affected by the breakdown.
A blood bath of ananic acts
The Representative House rejected the plan for support of the financial system on Monday, for which it should be used up to 700 billion (fast 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to submit the plan.
Bush's view would regulate the fundamental causes for the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the whole economy.
The Ananian acts experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important activity indizers deployed the largest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index ran about nearly seven Pro, a similar break in 1987.
The index was already decreased before voting, but it was rarely indicated that the draft in the House of Deputy would not be achieved, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes accommodation: US government can pump 700 billion into the banks
The main representatives of the Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed in a wide range of an agreement on financial aid for the financial system.
The vote is to be voted on the beginning of the next week.
In discussions on the deduction of a salvation plan in the form of a financial aid for the financial system in a range of 700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
The Congress lawyers must negotiate more details of the Agreement before they may publish and vote on the conclusion of the law.
The Financial System Plan will be negotiated on Monday in the Congress.
On Sunday, this was said to the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Agency Reës.
According to the senate, different information may probably be voted on the plan as early as the middle-week.
According to economics, a notification that the plan is being forwarded should be the first importance of psychological psychologists for the promotion of the financial markets.
Thereafter, however, there is a "promotion" due to complexed mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have achieved a significant progress.
We have made our various views on how a package to stabilize the market," said the Democracy Nancy Pelosi to the Agency Bloomberg.
According to your words, it could be a final vote on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators met the Sunday night with the Financial Minister Henry Paulson to give the Governing Fund its final form.
This provides a depreciation of an unprofit hypotechnical activity from the financial companies that distorts financial funds in serious losses and provides the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the border of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You need to continue the education plan, but I think we're at the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly decreasing in the asset markets that are strongly decreasing.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were attempted to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
This is the point of pointing to investors in the Asian financial markets in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect the business on Monday.
However, until it is not clear when both rooms of the Congress will be voted on the law, there is also uncleanness on whether negotiations in the last minute could not be able to deal with a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be forwarded in the next days.
However, the law will learn some changes.
The total amount specified for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion will be prepared as quickly as possible as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the exhaustion of the rest of the money if he has the impression that the programme does not carry out its function, even in addition to 100 billion, and later the final 350 billion.
Bush makes progress in negotiations positive
Although the Chairman has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can overcome its Veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remains based on the recovery of funds for the purchasing of bad hypothecalyptic papers which have been valued because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay their hypoteques.
"We've got everything out.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then on Monday," as the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was also satisfied by the president Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "appreciate the both-side effort to stabilize our financial markets and to spare our economy".
Limitation of golden falls screen
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading undertaking, claimed that the legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of tax payers against losses, the conclusion of grants and a plan for the financing of the plan.
The new law will also endanger the so much golden wallets for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and set up a committee to the Fund.
This will lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have made it very hard and have achieved a great progress towards a agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates assistance for householders who have problems with refunding their hypothek.
The Government should negotiate new advice in hypothecs, which will take place, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the guilty and enable them to keep their households.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, an idea, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you do not know what mechanism and what price the problems of assets will be made.
This will be determining how the financial sector and the Government share the losses among themselves," Marek said to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is now or the beginning of the next week, Marx's view is not exhaustive.
"The more important is that the Congress lawyers have some to submit the plan and adopt it as quickly as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on a distortion is at this point the most important thing," Mark stressed.
Dual on Messer Snippet: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you at your choice
Because of almost every MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can still be phoned.
So, of course, it seems that it's better to buy only a phone.
Despite all, there are enough reasons why you should set up a private player.
The choice depends completely on the type of use and the benefits of the future owners.
Certainly, you buy yourself hard for home a great hard disk player to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news appears not on LPs, and in qualitative view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you are probably dreaming at least of such a person.
This is also with music on travels, so with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue for a player eight thousand crowns, but also a Pink Floyd-Fan will probably be forced seriously to hear for twenty corners from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room.
The selection is width-safe.
The life duration of the battery is also determining.
Some music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can, they don't even create spiritually.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, take both, it has a better time, times a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you are still involved in the artphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in the box.
It's a little miracle, because no cold shot can grill and no television photograph.
However, the phone's universality also brings deficiencies with itself.
The more functions you use on your phone, but the more often you will have to load it.
And playing music is one of the largest energy fresh.
Only few phones can play music longer than 12 hours, mostly it's much less.
In this regard, Music Player (specially the simplest) is clearly more powerful.
Therefore, you should consider on the phones that they can't play music more than a few hours.
When you get off and still phone, you better buy a loading device for security - that also applies to more furniture.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one upload.
Another problem is then if you want to play music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices through a USB closure, and any phone without special software can not be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can play music directly on a record, but only few card reading devices will be completed without reduction with the winning memory cards used on your phone.
Players do not need any special software until you find exceptions (iPod).
You need to feed the device only via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves provide a music library, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices represent only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should especially experience the lifetime of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the use comfort.
It is music for you, especially culies, and listen to it only shortly every day, for example, in the roadway, and then enough any phone that plays MP3 files.
What really can almost every phone.
You do not need to control any music formats that a phone or a player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most music you get will just be in this format.
The format belongs to the most spread, and the most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less usually is AAC (using a format, the apple and its iPods).
Better phones also enables the purchase of music online.
Only mobile Internet is required to call the appropriate pages of a provider (or another provider) and you can already buy a song or album.
This service may already be an argument for the reason why a music handy should be assigned.
Unfortunately, the boat of the suppliers is bad and is limited only to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally indicated that just this kind of sale of music (as regards GSM, Internet or free Internet) will control the music industry in the future.
The phone's most of them.
If you like to listen to something, take the phone in the Jacketsheet while the player is forgotten at home.
However, if you are always listening to the head or at least a free speaking facility at your own.
If not, you can go back to the integrated sound speaker, about which almost every phone is available, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest benefit of music hands will be given to many in price.
The most valuable costs usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you're already getting a very nice Walkman.
The largest handicap will be for most people that there are no normal head listeners.
The best and technically designed phones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal head-to-head hearers cost up to five thousand crowns.
The benefit of the player is still in the easily control.
The most simple - and not unconditionally balanced (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of the use with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an irrelevantly employed mobile internet and a terrible account for data transfers.
What device should we take now?
In addition, the most billed phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually available to a slot for exchangeable memory media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you purchase a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are exposed.
But respect.
Basic models are usually supported only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most precious can also read 8-GB speech cards.
If you already want to buy a phone and buy another price MP3 player, then take to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Because of capacity (max. 2 GB) then you must not put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
You belong to the apologist listeners, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have self-control buttons for MP3, and the service comfort comes to one individual MP3 player.
The most important is here, Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category from up to four thousand crowns, but with a memory capacity (to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) allowed you to play MP3 players from the above manufacturer.
The first supplier already comes to Czech in this year.
Maybe
The mobile in Czech Republic is properly equipped to offer the Czech providers practically all services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Yet, there is something - a supplier that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this one will not wait for a long time.
That the Czech mobile providers work at the most decent in Europe, we have often reported this on Mobil.cz.
This also affected the telecommunications partner CTU, which noticed that the price for a SMS is here as in the European Union.
According to the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming taxes, it is likely to have a paradoxal situation - for some of the Czech mobile providers, SMSs will be more equitable than home.
How does the prices in Czech Republic be so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really makes a fighting anxiety.
Maybe it sounds paradox, there are three mobile networks in Czechland and a long penetration of more than 100%.
However, mobile providers want to shift about that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Council (CTU) Pavel Dvořák, who often expressed in the past that there was no place for another provider in Czechland.
It is probably true that a classic provider with a own network has no longer many chances (only he would like to find some of the frequency).
But there's another possibility -- a supplier.
Once the entrance of the supplier on the mobile holder was a clear price decrease with which the classic mobile providers had to respond.
There were still similar votes as in Czechland before such firms come in, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain.
However, it has shown that there is a place for such providers and that they can really be comfortable.
On the other hand, you have no longer need to look for examples.
In February, we reported this about the beginning of the mobile provider in Poland.
In only a half year, this provider was to win over 100 thousand customers and thus to increase to the five-group supplier in the country.
Return to mobilization is the Penta Financial Group, which is in Czechland, including U:phone.
The benefit of the provider is that you can be able to address a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, suppliers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for building, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, such suppliers are usually profiled as low cost companies - they offer good telephone talks and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less large service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in British SMS offers at least half more balanced than his competitors.
However, as the example of mobilizing in Poland shows, it may also be a good choice to put on an unclean target group.
This provider is particularly addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider who loves and trusts them," so David Seibert, the CEO from the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this supplier.
Difficult to say whether a similar concept like in Poland could take steps in Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepisk also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which the majority of suppliers are based.
○ he is relatively placed in the view of the service offer."
In Czech Republic, the mobile provider
However, it is almost sure that if a mobile provider obtains Chech, this will not be mobile.
"Although we speak of an extension of this project, the negotiations in Czechland do not look hopefully.
In a telephone conversation for Mobile.cz Jana Studičková, press speaker of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, she acted so that the current mobile providers in Czech Republic were not strictly accessible to this idea.
In contrast, they are trying to do everything so that no potential competitor occurs.
Your interest at the start of a mobile provider has already longer been shown by the GTS Novera group who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the field of companies.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only firm networks but also mobile telecommunications services.
And ever before, much better.
We have negotiated this opportunity again with all the Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we had already been able to make progress in negotiating," as the press speaker of the group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there's better time now.
Not official information indicates that the first supplier may be expected until the end of the year.
But too, this is surrounded by an unwindable wall of the weight.
"In this moment we do not conclude that there is a place in Czech for a full-valuable supplier.
The Czech market shows great specifications to other markets.
There has not yet been any subject to us with a complex and serious project in this area," he says in his claim for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srszeň from the Presse Department of Telefonica O2.
The specifications of the Czech market are also indicated by additional suppliers.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová f · in rare concordance with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a vital and both-side advantageous project that could continue to build."
And she adds: "In the T-Mobile network, there will not be any available provider until the end of the year.
At this point, we have already gotta have proposed a concrete boat to think so short-term."
Vodaphone is more attentionful to the achievement of the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepisk refers: "For negotiations with potential suppliers, we are open, especially in the area of splitting costs and infrastructure.
This is just what we see from the customers' view as the best.
The main strategy of Vodaphones in this area is searching for a partner to build a shared network for a quickly mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the supplier's hand in hand
The operation of the mobile provider is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, which would lead to decreasing prices and thus reduce the profits.
So why should such competitors facilitate market access?
That the suppliers can drag on a strange side, when something happens, also the long Hin and Her refers to the rise of U:phone.
The most strong pressure in the direction of ČTU went on the time U:phone came on the market, from the T-Mobile company.
This also shows public accessible information from the CTU websites.
But now, U:phone is just an argument why you should not allow a supplier.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition area of the Mobile has recently been strengthened by the marketing entry of a fourth mobile provider.
With regard to the character of the Mobile in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would set high requirements on the market itself and, in particular, its services."
In view of this approach, however, the mobile supplier amazes the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory staff.
It is not only the attitude of the CTU, which, unfortunately, in Czechland - in the subdivision to British and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to participate in the economic competition.
This is excluding the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OCDE).
But this related to this whole problem, his whole typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a mobile provider would then be possible after a contract concluded between a mobile provider and a holding supplier on the establishment of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded until now because the potential interested boat was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," so in his answer to our request Crisian Chalupa from the UOHS External Relations Department.
The representatives of the suppliers would not surprise such a formulation.
A authority representing the consumer officers, which should, among other things, be concerned that no one has misuse its position on the market, is more important.
In particular, if Christián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign place where suppliers work completely normally, it is to be observed that their market income has come to a price decrease at mobile phone services."
However, the pressure of the market is probably not the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the nearly touching compliance of the three mobile providers resulting from their reactions.
The question is whether it really is just a case, is on the hand.
Like the absolute totally equal gas price in tanks, it is certainly only a case and the result of a hard competition fight.
"In this matter, the Authority has not discovered any signs that refused to act against competition, and thus has no reason to be involved in any kind of matter.
No of the suppliers has a dominant market position, thus he does not have the corresponding higher responsibility for his market action.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the Mobile to providers have probably also felt the telecommunication regulatory composer," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, exclusively from the CTU, that, after telecommunication from the view of the economic competition, is a single market.
On such a market, of course, no of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another way - for the marketing of a supplier, it is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile provider has, logically, the monopol for his network.
This means that he accepts a dominant position in a certain segment.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile providers are likely to follow.
The complaints of a series of interested persons (as the GTS Novera complaint) indicate that they were very similar barriers in negotiations with all providers.
In the telecommunication services, the responsibility to the CTU is then a quite usual trick with which the UOHS is distanced from all the matter.
This was already to be observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent Novelle of the Telecommunication Law has not been able to implement the extension of the CTU's powers in the field of the economic competition in telecommunication, although a number of experts of them had been urged to improve the situation.
This is the only thing that UOHS representatives need to know, but they probably have different interests.
It's going if no one looks at it
Without prejudice, some pseudo-virtual providers are still running only once, of whom there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
There are firms who issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications, but which are only parts of public.
It is usually businesses that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Mobile telephone services, for example, offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only elected.
The witch of the thing is that the company comes to the operator as a classic company customer, which represents a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers are prohibiting a similar type of recycling.
"If there are cases you describe, it may be a damage to the contractual conditions with which we will then be able to work with what can lead to the end of cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that such a thing does not match the responsibility of the mobile providers.
In the case of three mentioned companies, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such action.
In fact, the activities of these companies did not allow them to be deteriorated, at the same time, they would not be affected by the official marketing in the subsection to the actual suppliers.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepisk notes: "The law allows such species of specule, despite all, the services of these companies will only benefit from a very low progressive setting of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card is not running on their name, so they cannot be fully able to have the normal customers of the mobile providers."
But alone it must have been at least strange.
○ Another question is opened for the OECD.
Close the mobile providers from such a procedure, why are they locked against a supplier?
It is added that the OECD has sufficient powers to discover such activities, and if it doesn't want, it must not be satisfied with the statement of the providers, they would not know anything about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
WHEN Czech Republic is no longer the best
As stated in the text, the market income of the provider has made a clear price decrease in the various services.
In practical cases in all countries where suppliers have occurred, the classic providers have attempted to prevent their growth practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small or too satisfied market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, the regulatory agencies, which were not in any way the interests of mobile providers, but those who tried to pursue their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached the first operator and followed it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies become the whole case as a warm carton.
In the outcome of our experiences, we cannot determine the impression that inaccuracy in the powers in these cases is more than beneficial.
But we don't put the flints into the wheat.
If the background information votes and soon occurs a supplier, the Czech mobile will probably be moved back.
If a supplier allows the creation of an institutional mobile provider, the OECD will not remain active if it is to refuse other interesters (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally not call more furious than Europe's.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new records of the National Hymne Where is my home country on the day of the Czech State at a hour of celebration.
The Hymne was newly played by the orchester of the National Theater under the leading of Jiří Belohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solar song, in Chorfassung and in a instrumental version.
The summary was taken by Catherine Princescow and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymnes versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Belohłavek, the Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
In the past, he told the Czech that he had chosen for the Solo-variant songs with young, representative voices that are marked and beliable.
"From the beginning, I have tried to keep a clear diction to understand the text, so that it might come to an agreement," as the director.
The Czech National Hymne goes next year to its 175. Jubileum.
The song Kde dove my first experienced in 1834 on the stake theater's fountain in the original Czech Fidlovačka part of Joseph Kaietán Tyl, the music of František Škroup.
It became else, and the people accepted it spontaneously.
The first stream of the song was then a organic component of the national hymne after the creation of the Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymne sounds
The Prager's carriers transport the middle of the mid-week also to a chip
The midweek, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of the Prager Verlust operators as a date on which the first travellers will enter into a U-boat, roadway or bus, instead of a paper carrier .
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who purchase the chip card Opencard.
The travelers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or a year-coopon (equivalent from 1 January 2009) and play this on their chip cards, as well as in the information and offices of the officers at the U-Bahn-St日 Museum, Mostek, Nadraží Holešo, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrrada, Kacherov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the web pages of the transaction operators www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was charged by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet repository can really forget the U-Bahn St window where they have to wait regularly in long serpents on their papers.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, it will be played on the open card in one of the three branches of the city library.
"In these places, the traveller also has a traveler with educational staff, the interested person consults the Internet purchasing and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrny.
Besides the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played to self-management machines on the open cards set in some U-Bahn wheat bubbles.
How do you look like these machines?
They are red, noticed to travellers, the travelers may have already observed in the U-Bahn-St Roztyly, Bu日ovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavskska.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but the end of the year will be eighty," adds Opatrny.
The coupon controls the location of the driver a automatic
The management of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
Only you have to enter the chip card, and the previous coupon is playing from yourself.
The electronic coupons are not only applicable in the main city but also in the environment since morning.
Thus, in the forests and bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the communities of the region reached Mediterranean in the capital.
"In the moves integrated in Prague, the train-complete reading devices with which they can check the duration of the coupons after time and zone," Philip Drápal said by the Ropid Organization.
The prestad buses have card reading devices in the box at the driver's box.
When incoming, the chip card must be displayed not only for the driver, but the open card is to be placed at a known place on the side of the box.
This means that the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"When a traveler wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drápal.
A guest that doesn't drive with prestadt buses and doesn't know anymore when the coupons' validity ends can go back to the self-control machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information about the validity of his documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten asked the United States for a national decision
In 1945, the Southern Germans requested the association of the Bohmerwald to the United States.
This comes from a letter that stores in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we will at least want to live under the United States' s screen rule.
With such a desire, in 1945, some groups of South Indians would have joined the US presidents.
This includes a letter that remains in an archive and is stored today in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau requested in the letter of the Presidents of the Ananias that he would not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich Agreement - to the Czechoslovakia.
"We have understanded the situation correctly and want to be sure of the words that the units of the Ananias are not as the underpressor and enemy of the German territory, but as the releaser," it says in a letter that is understood by the words "men whose shicks are on the horse".
Since the association with the Czechoslovakia - known to the Czech National Charter - believes that they would expect brutality, unconsciousness, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the officers of the letter request to the Presidents of the Czech Republic to take the protection of the Bohmerwald for today and forever.
"We can't believe that you're not taking into account the view of a quarter billion inhabitants of this area to speak to a foreign state for us, trying to submit and remove minorities and have nothing to win the Allied," it is reading in the letter.
The reason why the manufacturer cannot sign it is the most likely before the outsides of the "Czech underprinters".
If the President of the United States doubts about the memory of Bohmerwald Germany, it would be sufficient if he in Bohmerwaldgau would initiate a people's decision on whether the United States residents would be or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of the post war history may sound a little naive, he, however, considers some times a picture of the expectations of the Swedish.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to say that they would be negotiated about their discharge from the Republic, only few of them had a possibility to do so at all.
Some expected that the United States and the United Kingdom would negotiate a type of autonomy for the Southern.
Others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also occupies the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, from Budway.
He was used in the war as Buddhist German in the marine in the East Sea.
When he arrived in British prison at the end of the war, and was taken into a prison camp to Holstein, thousands of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"You believed that if they came home, they would have passed by the Czech," said Chalupa.
No one of the German war captives held before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that it would be extracted from the Republic on the basis of the Benes decrees.
You don't think, then, go!
A emotional loaded campaign is addressed to the car driver
The first action on security on the streets in the Czech history.
In addition, the emotional loaded media campaign has been characterized, which will start the Department of Foreign Affairs in the middle of the week.
The Authority of Minister Aleš Rhebiček promises to leave the driver of annual behaviour behind the road.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flights.
It must remove the driver from too faster vehicles and alcohol taxes.
And they also remind that they're throwing themselves before the traveling.
The campaign wants particularly young drivers, motorcycles, footsteps, and not later professional drivers to speak in consciousness.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially history of people who call on emotions.
This is also the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think, then, go!
The words "not thinking" are in cases of characters.
And then in a laugh of blood, the word "pay".
This should mean that you can pay a moment of insight with your own life.
The spots will be shocked by the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the angelsachsian countries, where a totally normal images can be seen with drastic records of accidental victims.
It is promised that the accidental numbers and the number of injuries fall down on the Czech roads.
The Spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and cotton for car vehicles
"For the driver, the motto sugar bread and peitche is applied.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when they walk in red, they save time.
The pitche is then the refreshment of a punishment or a accident.
The driver must be recorded to the risk," as the physician of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
Therefore, information campaigns in the press and particularly negative advertising are needed, says psychology.
Its opinion is less efficient than tables that make the drivers attention to one.
"If you set up a statistical table that warns before a person, this will probably probably blow up with the surrounding, and the drivers will not see it anymore," says Korrán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in the exchange of peace
The president of the provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, so also Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan-Heights, when peace with Palestine and Others can be closed in exchange.
This he emphasized in an interview printed on Monday from Jediot Acronot.
"We must agree with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupated) areas, if not all," Olmert said to the journal.
"We keep a certain prosecution of these areas, but we will have to stop the Palestinians a similar high prosecution (Israean regions) because there will be no peace without this," he adds.
He concluded that a possible return would also include the East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or Bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends is, will have to delay on a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in example of two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and hurt tens of people.
According to the words of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historical places" located on the territory of the ancient city.
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
"It will not work," he continued.
Return from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke about a discharge of Israel from the Golan-Highs, which is the result of his view of an unrelevant condition for the conclusion of a peace contract.
However, this would also require certain efforts on pages of cuss.
"My proposal doesn't mean to shut up with unified and alone on the basis of a refusal from the High Golan Peace," confirmed Olmert.
"The more only knows too well, and they needs to disturb them to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to disturb their current relationship with Iran; they will have to disturb their relationship with Hisbollah's (schitical) movement; they will need to disturb the continuous support they give to the terrorism of the Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorization and the Dschihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," concretized by the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: are Stewards in the bus irregular?
The law doesn't know that it's not allowed to run in a remote bus
With regard to the trailing accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers can run and run during the bus.
"If we strike and keep the law formally, the activity of a Stewards is in reproach to the road transport law," as the speaker of the Department of Foreign Minister Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in the last week, a twenty-two-year-old Stewardes was probably caused by the leader of the LKWs who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment with all the disasters next to the driver, at the least safe space in the car, although she had two other places available.
But a bus can also have an accident or a scarce brems in which the Steward coffee or newspapers are experiencing.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped to the vehicle's letter, as well as with stainboards.
If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The remote travel buses of Student Agency have no stairs; what the Director of the Company, Radim Jančura, visited towards currently.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not agreed first to move travellers.
Later it has been taken back, and we have reached a consensus, where the travelers can go to the toilet when they have their seat," he shared his position.
The law doesn't know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation that prohibits the transporter to provide services.
The Law on Road Traffic only knows the term of vehicle members, but its rights and obligations are not defined," the speakers of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly added.
However, the Director of the Department of Road vehicles of the Department of Joseph Pokorny considers that the law covers the problem.
"It is the point of whether the bus in the product assessment has also a steepplace.
Then it's all," he emphasises.
Buses are divided in town buses where there is a staple and the maximum speed is limited, narrow buses with staples and a allowed speed and remote travel buses with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with safeguards.
Like in the aircraft, says the expert
The BESIP expert for the security of Jaroslav Horien does not see a fundamental problem in moving Stewards on a bus board.
"The situation is comparable to the service on the board of an aircraft.
Even here is not sure when turbulences come, and the Stewardess can touch the head."
"But if a bus is scarce, then, of course, the laws of the physics also apply.
Like in the town bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must be held by the carrier by internal rules," he also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to stop the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus firm services of Stewards.
The company works about two hundred persons in this function.
The Director shall also consider its profession as riskable after the accident.
"When I get the impression that Steward's profession is riskable, I'll stop him.
Coffee and magazines can get the travellers when incoming.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As a security interest, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin based on the lack of Stewards in buses, but his company was only a breakdown of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewards, but we've been denied from the beginning.
Before or later, this ends with any death accident," he had not expressed a whole year ago for Tyden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Neapel, a young Stewardess from the region of Pilsen was unfortunate, which had been held two years for the society.
The Slovenian LKW was probably not blinded from the station and had locked the car to the bus.
The carrier of the bus tried to exhaust by a sharp manover, but colidered with the right advantage with the LKW.
That the two places for the Stewards were rebuilt, Jančura disputes.
"These sites cannot be reserved in remote connections, they are blocked."
The company will complain LKW-Fahrer.
The Agency is not expecting the court, but it also expects a financial replacement of damage from the sides of the guilty.
A change in law?
Not in View
A more precise arrangement for the movement of Stewards on a bus could bring a legal rule in which a three-five expert team of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already a year.
"This has not yet reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather than the pointing system, the maximum speed on the car and the use of phones on the road," says Expert Horein.
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not consider Stewards' activity as something that could consider the security of travellers essentially," Hanzelka, which is the control of bus safety in the competence of the police and the workshops.
Düsseldorfer hopes to rest in Frankfurt
In the letter of the WestLB representation, it is not lacking to the employees of the House.
By combination of units of the Düsseldorfer Financial Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-bank, "the Central Capital House of the Sparkassen Finance Group" means the writing made on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable entry force in such a business.
And, at all, such a link of the decision-making approach to further associations in the country banking sector.
This is what it reads if a state in difficult time wants to demonstrate operational ability.
Because the worst WestLB is as well as under violent pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission but also by the Federal Financial Service Surveillance Agency, which the North-West-West Government has clearly clarified recently the time to find a future solution.
From a link between the Deka bank, the Sparkassens know about their investment funds, but WestLB has been talking - also on Frankfurter side since a while.
The Deka-Bank Chef Franz Waas has made clear at the proposal of the half-year numbers end August, in a fusion of the house on the country road with a country bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Governing Board of Deka, which has ever been entrusted to help the countries banks and the Sparkassen associations, has ordered the proposal to conduct with the WestLB talks on common businesses.
It could be about capital or parts of it.
The talks have been free, named at the financial place, just started.
From the deka bank, which counts with its 3000 employees to the most important employees in Frankfurt's financial area, it is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the Sparkassen sector.
2003, it looked like a moment that the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this triple band.
As the plans have become public, the Hessian government has spoken against the participation of Helaba.
Even the two other householders did not find one another.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, it has always been a new game of thinking about a connection of the deka bank with country banks.
However, the Chairman of Helaba, Günther Merl, had spoken against planning games on a meeting with houses.
However, it seems to be aware that a summary of the various hausers of the public-loven sector is not.
After the day choice in Bayern is over, the BayernLB could first draw close to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not absolutely a message.
If the pressure should increase to additional merges, you will go after and after the partners.
In the south, she would only be more Junior partners, although she has even been better over the financial crisis than the households in München and Stuttgart.
At a meeting with the West LB again, Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has been shared in Helaba by 85 Pro, has foretold a rival at the beginning of the year.
In any case, the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one page.
On the other hand, the question is how the various business models of the individual houses are suitable.
In June, Merl, the decision-making question on which business model should be ensured the futureability of the banks, has not been answered by German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
Finally, there could also be a transparency of the West LB, but it would not be self-requested there.
Thus, in the letter of the neighborhood's letter, there is the speech of it, in any case it will be a "commerce" solution for the house.
As it allows each unit to bring under a hut with the combination of the units with the deka bank, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the fourth time.
But this time, Elena is his friend, and that's what's different, he says.
After them, at the five-liter beerfass of the Mark Caiser, a massive gebaba_Bartiger stands and proves the about 200 October-fast travelers, which deep sounds can produce his wheel.
Elena gives Luca a cup, then a cup.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the Busparkplatz near the Bahnhof Puorta Nuova, starts this evening at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "destination Monaco, festa della birra", probably 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are preserved in particular to the Italians, traveling in a bus outside Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking place, the South Americans sing near their captivity, they have already spent the night.
And as soon as Marcoguard says, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who carries a long mantle with pelzimitat feed and a brilliant with wide silver wings, belongs to the buses.
Since five years, they are going to the October Festival, three tours are alone in this year.
On the night, day over on the whistle, at 22.30 p.m.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the road, the welcome drink with Caiser-Beer, broken by the Bayer cleanness offer, the hospital insurance and the German traveller - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are rolling the night, on the car street "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Sch ́s going to be nice in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixs and wood churches, where also some other buses with Italian characters on the car 8 shortly before monkeys.
When Marcos Group is planned at half seven hours early at the parking place near the terrace, there are 50 other buses in Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather themselves, Marco holds a last ana, explains the attack plan.
First: Set the yellow bottle.
On the left, "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "coscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the bird, it means running!", Marco calls in tomorrow.
"Right!" Run and hold the table in the back of the tabernacle.
"Not forward, else we block, and not all yellows on the same legs, distribute in the room!"
The measure, Marco, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget the drink money.
"The security clauses show that we are doing good!
When you leave the place, they are away."
Thirdly, "Tonight point half eleven again here!" Do you understand?
And we're going to show.
On the road of a yellow chappie as a travel mark to the trees, on the scrolls and even on the choiceplacate of a large Bayerian people party.
You want to be armed for the back move.
It's the second weekend, as "Italian weekend".
There is no precise information about numbers; the talk is about 50,000 who are on the road over the alpes and fall into the birds, the pro-project of all sugars should be traveled extra from Italy on this weekend.
The Münchner Police is strengthened by seven police from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers understood the Bayer Red Cross, which leads a NBC statistics, in which the Italians represent the first place before British (approximately 60 units) and Austrian (approximately 80) with approximately 200 military provisions.
In the case of the Italians, the court is broken.
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, emphasised by the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück in the last week.
How good it is that the term "relative" has been used and has also been influenced by the German banking sector that will not be removed from the crucial developments.
'Cause it has come on the weekend now.
The billion credit from a consortium of German banks receives a billion in order to avoid the turbulences on the markets.
A person trusted in the situation said Reë's on Monday that the credit aids are up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only needs to take the part that it also takes in charge.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Backgrounds are losses in the daughter Deppa.
According to a long-term project report, the State financer had refinanced extremely short-termly - which is not possible in the midst of unbelieving markets.
In the first half year 2008, the bank's reserve was decreased by 95% to 2.37 million euros, including the own capital rates were easily deferred from 1.6 to 1.45%.
The current income and net income from financial operations were fallen to zero in the previous year period, the income from demands and certain value papers and the refunds in the credit business of more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to income from refunds of post-refunded costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, and from the refund of prices in accordance with the tax regulation, and from the business provision for concurrent companies, the income reduction of approximately 16 per cent had remained moderated.
The former State financer had been inspected after his implementation in 1990 with professional immobility credits, which were then separated in the Aareal Bank.
Since it was too small in the classic state financing, the Depfa was then enhanced in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversity.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now needs to make records that will have a "significant material effect" on the winning and loss of the group, it is rightly undetermined.
The fact is that the division was stripped.
It was reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant state and infrastructure financer since the receipt of the depth.
It is stronger than other institutions depending on the refinancing of the interbanks, since it has no customer investment.
With the combination of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank, two weeks ago, the credit grant under the banks is re-employed, since the banks are equipped with their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needed a part annually - approximately 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial need is covered at an absorptive time and the company is defensed "for the influence of the currently unfunctionable international markets".
From other sources, it is to be heard that the refinancing has been guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The HRE president of Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer be required to take the money markets at absorptive time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Fund for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) demonstrate that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now safe.
This is expected for actors and believers of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamics and insights of the crisis, there is no consciousness.
It is not even inevitable that the financing should not be completely charged.
But also the opposite is not to exhaust.
After the bank was still before the injection on Sunday, at least the provisional salvation could not be able to delay the hosts.
The action rate is 75 Pro^ to 3.30 euros.
However, the rate of contributions is well-reached.
If the priority debts are not moved, the courses of the debts are more clear.
In particular, the contributions of the former daughter-fimma Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the time-limiting periods over 2009 are taken into account.
If the hypo-real-estate investment appears to be a speculative investment option, their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after clear decrease of the bank crisis and the institution itself, which had been taken into the house by the depth to the depth.
As long as the note banks, governments and less appealed business banks are still ready to support the system, so long as the pensions can be expired.
But this is what is not expecting anybody to expect at this time that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reporting on the sub-statuation, the probability that is limited to security has now become just a justified hope.
In particular, the long-term believers may prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-time investors can still use a contract for losses for future tax payments on course wines in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, would be presented at the Tachibana High School on the first day, the girls began to kiss: the German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she told her about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had bammel before school.
I live at Tokios border towards Kawasaki and take 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, for lucky I didn't pass.
The beginning of learning in Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as in our home in the Netherlands.
The students work from eight hours until twenty-nine before a short meeting circuit begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the teaching started, I was on the row to imagine.
I am not the guy who likes to speak before people, nor before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform, I had an old rock of my guest mother, to blue, blue knife and black driving shoes.
So in this ship, I put myself before the puzzle and tried to say everything right: "Sayonara Where she Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and I have a week of birth.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all shot, cutted and tried, and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survivory chat of Japanese girls, meaning 'soft, sweet'.
Then I'm quickly married to my place.
The girl near me was quite wide, she found a honour that the schooler should sit near her.
The hour was quite sad, but when the Gong died, I was regularly stressed.
Everyone talked and kissed and asked me a lake in the woods - that is really difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then, in the pause, all the bentos were packed out.
My guest mother also made me a lunchbox -- that's something else than the yellow German pause bread.
I had travel with crystals, small worms, salat from gurkens and algens, fruit and a kind of flesh in the tofumantle.
Mostly, I don't have a crazy shimmer, exactly what I eat here in Japan.
The things look strange and smile completely new.
It says it's really nice.
Well, until on the salt plants maybe, brirrr!
The Bentos are not just a breakfast at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bentoe that she then makes specially artistically - in the hope of learning closer to the boys at the pause.
That's what I read in my Manga Comics.
I'm surprised if I can see this too.
'Why then calculate Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Because it's fascinating me."
I've been reading the favorite mangas for years.
And to understand better the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So I was fully sure that I had to travel here once.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, seats and uses.
And you're putting a big value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disoriented and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet lost myself here, even if Tokio is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Besides rats have feelings
Does a race or a sheep flee when it means that she also feels afraid?
The neurological Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by famous professionals.
PUBLIC ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think of true without being able to prove it?"
I think animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness without that I or anyone else could prove this until now where we can't even prove that other people have a conscious conscience.
But in this case, at least we should hope, since all human brains show the same fundamental configuration.
However, when we apply other species and address questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we come to an inevitable land because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is inside, it does the same thing as many other animals: it becomes dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave similarly, whereas some societies conclude to a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to overcome our subjective experience on animals.
To one of the nearly always associated circles associated with the human consciousness include the side prefrontal Cortex (for his participation in short time memory and the execution/control functions).
This broad region is very developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, are therefore reasons for the idea that humans are even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic property may be in the language of the people: since a large part of his experience is connected to language, it often calls that the conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
However, even if the conscience doesn't deal with language, it would certainly affect it so that animal consciousness, as it may be, might be very different from most of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness can look in other animals.
If it is possible to analyze, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research leads to big problems.
Most of my exhibitions are related to the content of the conscience, but there is another aspect of the conscience that may be scientifically easier accessible.
The process of consciousness of animals can be examined without prejudice to their content, and this is exactly what happens in the short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this approach, Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, it is more likely to refer to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the cousal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the pre-frontal Cortex for the arrival of visualisation.
What is it now for the experiences?
I bring them back to that a emotional system such as fear is activated in one of its own A's conscious brains.
So what we have as "fear" is the mental condition in which we are, when the A of the brain-located deficiency system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) shows work memory.
As a result, experiences are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, the primates, and especially the people.
Related to the language nature, the feeling is clear because we can distinguish and category states by means of words and graphics to write them to others besides us.
For example, Antonio seems that experiences from primitive A’s in the cortex and the brain stamme are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more can be able to be on the brain stamp.
Since this network hasn't changed very much during human evolution, it can be shared in transparency experiences.
In theoretically, I can't oppose it, but it is not evident.
Pankseep arguments what occurs in rats and people like fear, probably feels like this in both cases: but how can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similar?
Does a sheep flee by if she also feels fearful?
In my eyes, only behavior is not likely to be likely to experience.
The neural comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brains, but not even a brain.
But is the brain staff responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to people, how would you show it in rats?
I think rats and other kidneys, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have experiences.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally distinguishing from our (which the human conscience is based on special scales and language), I prefer to investigate emotional behaviour than emotional experiences of rates.
In any case, there are progress on the neural level, unless the same is missing in rats and people.
As I do not investigate the language and consciousness in rats, even though I don't know whether they exist.
You may think that is shortly, but I prefer to go on walking against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
President Uefa Platini: Grace term for Poland and Ukraine
The presidential Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be subject to the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a confidential evidence in Ukraine and its ability to make EM together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"It's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is much to do in both countries."
In the time schedule for the building or rebuilding of stages, streets, hotels and airports, both guests are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't take time anymore.
We must now work with the maximum speed," said the  Ukrainian Federal President Grigorij Surkis.
"The EUFA will keep us in our eyes constantly."
A more radical step has been made in Poland.
The leader of the Poland Federation PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympical Committee and has been replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals.
The Commission had gathered on request by Sport Minister Miroslaw Drewicki.
It exists "the seriousness that the PZPN is not able to act in accordance with the rules", said the PAP of the Poland news agency.
"We have assured President Uefa Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several firstlighters were condemned only in the past season because of the manipulation of forces, even the start of liga had to be moved short-termly.
Recommended Dennis Quaid returns
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in the interview about ̈es - and now she has difficulty with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outete her deceased Dennis Quaid as a wedding.
He's crazy and getting back.
Latest Rosen War in the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood School players now have an unfair fight - in all public.
Meg Ryan was in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week for the reasons for the wedding: "It was a long time infidel, and that was very painful."
The measure of disappointment has led her to experience only after divorce.
The place for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new movie "The Women" - is told the history of a marriage break.
Dennis Quaid's response to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clearly stated: "It's unfaithful," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News," that "I can repeat the history of our relationship."
It is also "deceived", that the common 16-year-old son Jack is "repealed publicly to pain and conversions, which mean divorce for each child."

Lower prices for flight tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnights in Europe were more balanced than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have become more balanced than 50 Pro.
Flights and overnights in hotels have become more favorable - that is the result of the travel and financial service leader American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half year 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a clear breakdown in the second quarter.
After the prices in the hotel have been reached for years, the overnights have already been accepted in many places.
Since January to March, prices increased in 41 of 48 cities in a average of 6,9 per cent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, the prices have been less than in the previous year than 3,6 Pro.
The most evident trend was in Paris and Rome, where 30 to 37 Pro travelers had to have been less than a year ago.
As a result, American Express sees the weak course that leads to a "reaching loss of tourists".
In addition, financial places such as Frankfurt or London were more affected by the decreasing of the hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hannover, Köln or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices have a increase of 26.3 Pro even the record in Europe.
In addition to the flight prices, the trend showed up in the first quarter:
As a result of cherozin defense, travellers in the Economy Class in section 7,1 Pro > 2007 must have been more than 2007, trends intensive long-stream flights were even more than 29.2%.
From April to June, the prices for flight tickets of the economy class were decreased by a average of 12.5 pro in comparison to the previous quarter, but the price changes were significantly lower in the business and first class.
In Germany, prices are even greater than in other countries:
From January to March, the prices were paid at 11,9 Pro, and in the second quarter they were decreased by 23,6 Pro.
In German internal flights, the prices have even been half.
The reason for price input is the remaining economic growth on the one hand, explained by the company.
The request in many segments of the flight breaches.
On the other hand, through the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalises the air traffic between the United States and Europe, it is a higher competitive pressure.
The signs of the situation are the striking of inappropriate segments in Airlines, and the high number of flight companies reported in the first half year 2008 - only in Europe these were 24 flight companies.
HSV Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is a table leader.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is not still able to find a functioning elephant.
By Christooffer Small increases brushlanding for national players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came to the game late and switched with a hair to the late.
His message was exactly formulated, she was convinced of his lips.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger spoke in the Hamburger Arena cabining.
It was not in the catacombs, the half-time pause was completed and most of them sat back on their places.
Rieger was nearly three years of physiotherapy of the HSV, and he enjoyed a view as some of the flushing actors.
And so his request also found a hearing at a responsible place.

"It was a harmful victory," martyr Jol joined together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
The viewers celebrated on Saturday afternoon themselves, the blue heaven over the Arena and the tables on the video wall, which showed their unit as class premium.
It'll be a birthday without real party.
"We know to arrange it," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the tableary intermediary product is more for the incompatibleness of the Liga than for the domination of its HSV.
The people with their late access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Tors Pet; and the Jansen from FC Bayern - even if it is slow, it is not able to clarify.
"We need more Flair and more Dribblings," Jol asked.

Dark material affects the flight of spaces
For years a mysterious phenomenon has been provided in research for advicelessness: Dark material has affected the speed of space sons during the so-called swing-by-manover.
Experts claim that the general theory of relativeness Albert Einsteins could not be completely correct.
Almost 18 years the "Ulysses" room flew through the world.
You are now threatening the coal pitch because of railway guides quickly.
A mysterious phenomenon for Verwir for years has been provided for under-communications - the Swing-by-anomalia.
The Swing-by is a flightmanover of space-sounds, where they have a successive sweet in the gravity field of a heavenly body, such as the earth.
This means that the suns can spare a lot of fats.
The American research song Cassini Huygen also used this physical trick as the sunset Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have wondered for years: the flight bodies do not behave 100-prospectively as it would be expected in accordance with the ancient gravitation law.
Moreover, irregularities occur in speed.
The suns become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far the physicians could not declare this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomalia.
Some experts claim that even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attractive power of material by the raffusion of the Ra, could not be completely correct.
The physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes that Einstein is not wrong, and trys to explain the swing-by-anomalie through the so-called dark material that has exhibited the astronomes in the universe.
"As responsible for the anomalie may be a dark material that could also be close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark material, the world space researchers know about about about a few years.
It obviously comes from an attraction force that allows the effect on other heavenly bodys to be observed.
However, it is completely invisible, which means that it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light.
The dark material always makes a fifth of the whole mass of the Universe.
Tourists expelled in Egypt are free
After the days in their hands, the tourists in Egypt will be released again, as the Italian Foreign Minister was occupied.
The exporters from Sudan had requested a number of million euros.
In a shooter before the release, six soldiers must be killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been driven out.
Solution negotiations are already to be held.
Dutch's replaced in the Vision of Kidnappern.
We ONLINE differs the most important cases.
The tourists slipped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state TV, the Arab TV sender Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini visited the release after reports from the Italian TV Seeder Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other islands have been released.
We're just checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were safe and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition will already be on the way to Kairo.
Unclearly, the backgrounds of a shooter before the release of the ships remained in the back of the shooter: the deputers were then ready to finish the exemption before the sudanese army murdered surprisingly six deducers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a redemption," said the officer.
It was "only going to take the oil in receipt", when suddenly "This surprise" came.
Sudan soldiers shot six exhibitors and arrested two of them on Sunday in the border territory between the Sudan, the Tshad and Egypt.
The soldiers had requested a redemption of six million euros from Germany; the money should be transferred by the German wife of one of the female.
The daily journal "El Masri El Jom" reported by vocation to a German mediator, the release of the ships delayed because the Kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, the deputy wishes to release the female oil after payment of the redemption.
The men should be arrested until the deputy had a safe flight road.
The German message in Kairo refused a opinion on the report.
The misuse of the patriarch "leaving to suicide"
Annual misuse by her father led to a woman who killed himself was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison penalty for six years after eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro learned that he regularly fixed his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a guest: "I feel responsible for her death."
The Court learned that Mrs Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at 34 years of age.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had her eyes closed before he did sexual action, while her mother was gone to work in a guest place.
Trerise and his wife are going to divorce in the 1980s and he returned to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court recognized that Mrs Randle, who had a large part of her time in respect of the National Trust, was persecuted by the misuse, which had been given her twice in the week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife reported to the Court that friends would have said that Mrs Randle, who was a zealous surferin and race carrier since 2006, had been "emotional dead" and "rejected your life"
In April 2007, her right father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by providing herself through a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle confronted the father of his daughter, who wrote a guest letter, who ended: "I wanted to fix her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely famous pheticist and for her sacrifice it must have been terrifying, especially since she was seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
More worst is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would not be done before the court if she had not done this."
He added: "I take to know what effects, according to the description of Stephany's father and mother, had their work over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would clearly be a very promised, happy young woman."
Officer responsible for lost data shall be accused
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer, who had lost strictly trusted documents in a train in June, will be accused of the "Publical Security Act".
The man was assigned by the Defence Minister when he lost two very confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before they were released to the police.
It is the swee accusation within the law and there is no reference to criminal purpose.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said that the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that the Defence Ministry and Cabinet would have been inside."
The employee whose name is not known shall be accused by paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause covered by the safe storage of information.
The Royal State Advocate recommended that the officer should be accused by the Metropolitan police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he provided included classified assessments about Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqian security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and brought by house to a secret place.
Apartment building companies see B&B costs in the eye
British building companies could have costs of more than 80 million pounds in the house after the salvation of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government provided 14 billion pounds to shalt the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The loans for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including 59 building companies
The Director-General for the Association of Apartments (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "inconsistent" that the companies and their members had to comply.
The 14 billion loans will finally be paid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are debt.
However, the interests in the interim period are calculated each year to the 700 financial undertakings accepting payments.
The programme for the compensation of financial services was aware of the BBC that the 59 building companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully... are now called to take some of the costs of those institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each enterprise in relation to the investment that it would hold would have to be covered and that the companies had to cover about 18% of the costs together.
The Minister for Finance estimates that the interests for the credit will be amounted to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to gain 81 million pounds for the prices of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Apartments, told the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully during the immobilious exhaustion will now be called for some of the costs of those institutions that were much less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records were found in 1945.
"We will see all aspects of this thing in the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to make apartment building companies and their members of possible significant costs."
The rates that will be paid in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, rates will be decreased for a full year, which could be almost twice so much.
Since building companies are both-side organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by taxes or lower rates on spar accounts.
Milk is five pins per liter tired
The people on Jersey seem to be confronted with the need to swallow more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that the great price of his milk will be highlighted for five more pences per liter of Monday.
It is the second increasing price this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and it comes after a consultative undertaking has been conducted.
The individual operators should decide whether they want to submit the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the large price of Jersey Milk changed in 2002.
Ancient Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied the accusation
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a purchase of the former Prime Minister Sheich Hasina, which means that it could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Its defendants said that the Court refused to complain about 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several weak accusations for corruption against them.
Sheich Hasina's long-year political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released in the beginning of this month against cutting.
Sheich Hasina would return to Bangladesh in the next week, but her party, the Awami covenant, requested that the military transitional government should grant her unlimited freedom once.
The correspondents say that, although their detention has been granted to go outside for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release if it can continue to stay on the free foot when it returns to Bangladesh.
Their advocates indicate that they will now call on the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Court of Justice has rejected the Court of Justice, because it says that it does not have to be granted a currency because it is already on prison in the foreign country to be treated in the foreign", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will notify a complaint against the above court."
Their advocates claim that they need cution to return from the foreign country to prepare for the elections in December.
It will be expected that Sheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, a Awami party president of the Awami party on Sunday.
It was arrested last year after the oversight of the Army-under-government had taken the power, but in June it was released out of prison to go outside for medical treatments.
So that Sheich Hasina, and Khaleda Zia, lie all the points of accusation against themselves.
Prohibitions on the anti-poly initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-poly initiatives in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, such as the United States.
The United States N held a vaccine programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not get children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south of security foundations.
According to one of the United Nations speakers, this case, despite the Taliban's promise, was not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers.
BskyB lost complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the competitive Commission to reduce its share in the competitive ITV sender.
The Court of Competition has appointed BskyB to reduce its contribution to ITV by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted the competition and allowed him to have an unlawful effect on the sender ITV.
BskyB received its share in 2006 by renamed NTL to Virgin Media, preventing the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the competitor reported that the purchase of the share in ITV prepared by BskyB doubts on the independence of the ITV, which moved the competition committee to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communication Office have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure would reduce its share in the ITV was an inconscient and overcome action, especially because BskyB had announced to reject its voting rights.
New research in the US State Advocate Affairs
The Advocate General of the State has ordered a special investigator to consider the cancellation of the nine state advocates in the United States in 2006.
The approach was a report of the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of workers were criticized.
The report was critical to the officers of the Witness of the House, the legislator and the former State lawyer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was proposed by the prohibitions that the advocates had been suspended for political reasons.
The Special Mediator Nora Dannehy will now be clothing whether the officers inquired during the investigation have enjoined the investigators to prevent justice.
Severe proposals, including criminal proceedings, have not been completely investigated or confirmed, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in a report.
The vocation of a specialist with the power to force the Witnesses to say was one of its main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice began in December 2006, nine of the United States advocates from their entitlements.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the advocates would be determined by weak workshops.
However, later it was found that the dismissed state advocates had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, so that many observers were encouraged to consider the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these state advocates were involved in the judicial persecution of high-range members of the Republic of Congress, while others refused to investigate the proposals of the election of democracy.
US State advocates are ordered to investigate and follow judicial cases for the Government.
They can be released at any time, but they cannot be suspended for political reasons.
The former leader of the Ministry of Justice is Alberto Gonzales, advocate General of Justice, and has finally decreased his office.
A number of officers of the Ministry of Justice have also been canceled.
The report of the General Inspector has particularly critically encouraged the role of Gonzales by making the "major responsibility" for the releases, giving his leading role and showing himself "excedently interested" in the process.
Other officers, including the former Chairman of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the mediators.
Meat Loafs of epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the music price delivery "Q Award" for his episode hymne "Bat Out of Hell".
The song, who will accept his special golden price during the delivery next week in London, said that he was honored to be recognized.
The song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" includes the nominations for the price delivery of this year after it has come into the stricter selection in four categories.
The Chefredactor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some of them that go out of such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out of Hell" is certain of them.
The song that Jim Steinman had received required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes nearly two minutes.
The song was sealed in Britain as single in 1979 and reached 15 places in the Charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out of Hell" have spent about nine years in the Charts and have been born over 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in the last years, which was a operation in 2003 because of irregular heart failure after he was broken on the stage.
In 2007, he had to abstract concerts due to a acute heat inflammation.
Later, he was able to have a cyst on ­ voting band.
Obscure roads in town, often forgotten and maybe soon to cover
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side streets and other environmental roads, of which some are famous and others are only famous.
However, it is difficult to say for experienced taxi and long-year local seats where Extra Place is, simply because most of them have never heard of it.
This winzige street is located in the East Village and runs from the first street north direction between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
She's 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dust gate than after an active trailway.
There are no streets.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard road plan.
However, this road has her wonders.
For example, Avalon Bay, a building company that recently built luxurous buildings on the first street.
It wants extra Place to plant new to create a clean crossing to the woods and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
The other worshipers belong to the long-year neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short gate, just because it is one of the rest of the past of the household block.
However, the town administration department responsible for the protection and creation of residence buildings and responsible for the street does not have any interest in receiving them.
On a meeting of the Committee on Agricultural Use of the Community this month, representatives of the town management and Avalon Bay have decided a proposal for the purchase of the road through the building undertaking.
However, the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city and asks for a new plan to be submitted in the next month, so Susan Stetzer, the district responsibility in the community 3.
"Only very few rooms remain in the property of the city and we want extra place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offered to repair the road and run what Avalon could do, but we also want the public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small road is setting up new plants and sits, including a café to which the company wants to leave room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it wouldn't want it to.
"The main approach of the Avalon Bay is to renew this fallen gate and make a public meeting point," she said and added that the city himself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the building protection department, thought that it was actually the desire of the city to deploy the street and stressed the task of the Department to develop the immobility than to manage.
Compared with his beautiful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained something of his historic impression.
Some believe that the street has received their name in 1802, when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a strong strip country was invited by no one.
The back door of the CBGB Music Club, of the punkrock denkmal, closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is most of the way for the photo on the cover of the Alba. "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones.
The pflaster was great, said Danny Fields, the Manager of Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The street was filled with shots, lamps and parts of feet, potters, sheets and seals.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the Gentri creation of the East Village, have refused the idea of the sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public base, as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged split of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who was the blog named "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled to "The Book of Claims: A worst nostalgic kolick on the extinguishing city"), published a part of the talk of the city story about Extra Place, which occurred in the new Yorker magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small bitter sackgase that remains even daily dark and is known by the rounded metal doors of the stores, closed windows and rainlines forwarding weekly newspapers."
With few exceptions, the street looked just as recently on a evening.
A rat was running through the back part of the street, not far from the door, leading to CBGB, where there is a more furious clothing business today.
Graffiti were looking on the walls, and a empty beer bottle was not far away from a fresh bond of exhausted newspapers.
Some passengers said that they would rarely have followed the extra place, but they suggested that the street could be pulled something.
Fields, add to that, according to his opinion, some people underestimate the road travel in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the dark, dark places.
Debates on two-speaking training: Education in English environment
In this season of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-speak training.
Lance T. Izumi, leader of scientists in California and leader director in the field of education sciences at the Implementing Research Institute for Public Policy, is a composer of the book "Not as well as you think: why the medium class uses a choice."
The Spanish elector is to speak is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals for education are a typical example.
Obama's election campaign suggests that "the probability of the school in Afro-American and Spanish students is lower than in white students".
In order to close this performance distance, Obama's education plan is particularly recommended for a two-speaking transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question of Obama is whether its use for the two-speaking education that focuses on education in other languages than English corresponds to the interest of reducing the distance in school services.
Let's take for example "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in Los Angeles.
Most students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, of whom many have recently been in the country, learned English.
However, in 2008, a surprise of 100% of the fourth class students was the state examination in Mateus at a good level.
At the same time, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were well evaluated in the English review.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and a position that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach in which the education is in an English environment. This is exactly the point of viewing Obama, such as Leader Linda Mikels.
This approach is a value for the almost exclusive use of the English language in the science.
Mrs. Michaels, who refused the idea of two-fold education, said to me that the school had a noteworthy success with a student who had come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later, you would have attended the class room and could not recognize him anymore.
"It works," she noted, " it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English teachers?
The school's performance would easily make the answer to this question, but the educational positions within its own party (the national educational unions have long been undergoing the idea of two-speaking education) and its own consequent support for two-speak educational predicts about Obama's response.
As he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop making concerns about the objective legislation on "only English".
Instead, he said, "You must ensure that your child can be Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should consider carefully educational models that work instead of disturbing and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases the economy
The earthquake price is on Monday because of the promises that even the financial market salvation plan could not be able to resume the economy.
Roh oil-term operations at the New York Trade Bourses have fallen at the early session at $99.80 per barrel at $7 Pro.
Since the last month, the price has been charged for more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the markets have been shot by the financial turbulences on the Wall Street and by powerful furniture in the Golf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their level of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to $90 per barrel in this month to grow again as a result of the enormous inconscience in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have shown concern, even though the Congress representatives had announced that they would have agreed on a salvation plan on the weekend that should be the greatest in the history.
This message was estimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized Fortis' financial concerts.
According to the analysis of Barclays Capital, despite the stressed negotiations that have been located and led to a salvation plan on the weekend, it seems not to be able to live the vote on the markets.
Since the economic situation continues to be worse, it is expected that the request for goods, including oil, will continue to be decreased.
The German Bank's analystes have written in a communication to investors that the previsions for the global capital markets, price rates and exchange rates have become uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the markets will also be affected.
"On the perspective of the markets, we are mostly concerned about whether the US virus is spread worldwide, especially to China."

Manage record set by series in the second quarter
In-defensive Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he was born more than everyone else in Jets trickot in the last eight half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets converted an unexpected game into a triumph train.
"I've never seen something like that," Ellis said.
After a slow game between the Jets and the Arına Cardinals, which rejected the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-touchdown, it marked the perfect intake at a afternoon when its developing cooperation made a step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once exploded as a foreign defendant and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't been particularly forced," Coles says over the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, whatever people think."
Money Favre and Coles Fishes played, the defence of Quarterback Kurt Warner took one another.
External defense Darrelle Revis started an unfortunate worm and converted it into a 32-Yard-touchdown.
Libero Erik'ith came to another pass and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then provides a loss of warner.
The last ball lost, forced by Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had obtained the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets returned the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20 Yard shooting to 34 to 0 leader.
That was most of the points that the Jets had ever reached in a quarter.
When he asked to describe the crazy mind, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jet, answered "The second quarter or the fourth?"
On the answers both, because the Jets left 21 points in the quarter without reaching one, Mangini said: "Create me, I've enjoyed the second quarter more than that.
A lot of points have been achieved in short time."
Exhibited Bessel class has a good word
Heavy beer class from Ethiopia has shown again why some hold it for the best long-line looper every time after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who created the range of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebselesia improved its previous result of 2:04:26 at 27 seconds that he had reached in Berlin last year.
Gersellassia, 35, has established its 26th Welcome in his multilateral kare, where he has reached at least a world mastership title or set a well-treeord on each street from one miles to Marathon.
Last month, Gebsellassia has released the olympical marathon in Beijing, which may have been overwhelmed in the afternoon that air pollution could deteriorate its asthma problems.
Instead, he reported for the fight in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the goal - the gear class has won a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since travellers such as Gebselelassia and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long-streams, the record time for Marathon has fallen over 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 has won in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After Victoria on Sunday, Gebselelassia informed the press that he had been in his wade two weeks ago and could not train one week.
Obviously he was refreshed after pause and didn't rise back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"It's been perfect.
I took the training again a week ago and had still some thoughts today, but at the end of what's great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia Rivals from Eastern Africa - that he is exhaustively orchestrating his roads, that many of the best world Marathontars are generally endangered, trusting too much on the road leaders as if it would be a road, and putting world records on the fight.
However, this criticism does not damage the size of orsling classs as long-line loopers.
Along with four Kenyaners on Sunday, prayer class had reached the center of the streets at 1:02:04.
Two elite carriers from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to demand Gebselelassia after the timers had left.
Something more than three miles before the finish, Gebselesia has made his last approach to separate himself from Kwabai, who has arrived at 2:05:36, and thus has improved his best time for almost 5 minutes.
Camathi became the third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germany, has completed a significant year by 2:19:19 that she has shown the most result of all times.
Paul Radcliff from Britain holds the good word at 2:15:25.
In the last early morning, the 36-year-old Michitenko won London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She lost the games in Beijing because of problems that were described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her fair marathon for five minutes.
She has planned her run by putting a quarter out of ethiopical and kineanic lowers first, but after 30 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus came from Kenya as a third at 2:25:01.
The proudness and straits in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special species
Hidden between the evolvings of the free time parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles away from the glidering, sounding and giant tribes, is a safe city in which the pride and the complexity of the Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first totally black city in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, is not so easy to describe it as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 sea, three crocket places, 300 brown hairs, 300 good swimming, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today, it's a pilgrim.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival came to Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, it is and remains the city she described – which made it a tourist output target by taking it into the Florida traveller, which was produced in the time of the depression by the Federal writer project, in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is so independent, dead and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the wise man who "is so little about us that he doesn't know what happens to him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidency candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls to a open discussion on race conditions, many are still suffering to be observed by foreigners.
"We are very proud about how our story is spoken," so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and the congregation member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of the triumph and the battle.
It is a historical example of black movement and a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants, where the poor rate doubles as high as the average country.
On the one hand, it is a Hochburg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the southern country, which has its roots in the Slaveria.
It's not surprising that the inhabitants here are proud and on the hot.
And so exactly the thoughts about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Horston's name here.
She presented the world her home city in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five sections in the Florida Road leader changed the city that is close to the road 77, a street that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida to the shadows of black history and human drama.
Frequently as well as Oskar in real life as in literature, Hurston reader led to the load of Eatonville's first citizen, Joe Clarke, and then turned to private matters.
"Apart from the street to the left," she wrote, "is the braun - whissly intrigued modern school, with its places of gardens and games, that Howard Miller always cares, although he can not read and write."
She also discovered the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Geträ's every kind of covered and matches what-auch-ever to hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston also made Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a traveller.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," so the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, convinced Hurston by citing the men, the Li's song about their beauty, full of sexual impressions.
They said, "Multium people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a living exemplary woman who regularly returned after her family was held to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston was broken into the city, she did mostly this without warning, in a smokeful Chevrolet, smoking and clothing, in a city that is in a town that is in a town that is in her honest clothing style today.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the people were fascinated, however, many disobeyed them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But " she never remained too long," he looked up while he looked in chair, on a terrace behind which looked at the Sabelia See, in which Hurston was baptized after all probabilities.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and caught her books.
With the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was one of the famous authors, the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was involved in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no large memory celebration, no public readings in the large style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the garden," thus Valerie Boyd, author of "Wraped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston was published in 2003.
The wend came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-speak car through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-speak main roads of the congregation.
Orlandos forests have already driven the car 4 through the west town border.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still obtained from a difficult phase in his history.
Forcing integration, including, had ended the relative idylic isolation of the community.
In the 50ths, the fight against racial mixture has been in the Community.
"In this time, a lot of white boys often came and they threw orphans and a lot of people sitting in the absurd place," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, the request of the Supreme Court of Justice to force integration by providing its decision in case Brown against the School Council as a "profit to respect my race".
The people today say that, although the revocation of race training in some ways was positive, they weaked the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of their youths.
"Scare children were used to be obscured - I remind of it - too - to obscure his teacher on the morning and to obscure his teacher at night," says N. Y. Nath, daughter of Ella Dinkins and director of the business group for the protection of the Eatonville Community.
This could be obtained as long as it could be able to add it until teachers and teachers came from the same place.
"I didn't worry about his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean, there is a cultural cloud," said Ms. Nath.
However, the citizen's rights have made a place for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, showers and artists, who have been moved over prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse my society's joy?
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made himself on the way to Hurstons unnamed grave and began to fight for the rebuilding of her glory.
Five years later, a very promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was to find in the book regulations and made it again part of the literature canon.
The telestray project came exactly to a time in the most famous daughter of Eatonville once again in the light of the public.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurstons saw them as a salvation.
In 1988, the community began planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district would be able to deal with the building of cars.
Thousands of Fans came to the exhibition event two years later, and every January many return to the festival.
A few years later, the district turned away from his road buildings.
"The plans of a five-speaking television road were invading the city, accelerating the whole speed of the spice, wake real citizen stole," said Ms. Nath.
Mrs Boyd said something easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has reached a change in the city’s self-image.
There came more and more tourists, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to the church since 1993, and inheimians began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was enrolled in 1998 in the country's historical government.
In 2006, a new single library (of course called Hurston) opened on the newly stumbled and corrupted Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is like a distraction in Florida: only 6 miles from the city of Orlandos can sometimes feel like a backgase in the summer river, as small as at the time it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He's 90% black today.)
External search for the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still being treated with care.
For the majority of interviews, an approving in the precondition is necessary and certain things - as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was drawn by a science and represented by black men in the field work - cannot be photographed.
In Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a love for the dark root, still fear that her disappointed community will be misunderstood.
Yet, at the same time the Hurston Festival increased, a higher degree of households was also born.
In particular, young people are attracting Eatonville to see how Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all his problems, not bad or better and exactly proud, creative and flexible, albern and mixed as any other group of races and people in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's neighbors, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intended to return after the college to Eatonville to work in the city manager or in the police, which would have been able to help him.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old two-year-old winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right.
"The majority of those who are just going through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon recently said on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we're talking flexiblely to the finance latin.
Nothing has changed on the first corner.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the magazines and the violent television monitors in Times Square, they wouldn't remember that they were in a debacal middle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shooting offices with the glass fashions, bankers and He's fund administrators who have the Monopol in New York, each day have the worst day of horror since 1929.
The suppliers still drive the metal tea weights around the citizens and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos are still spending between apartments around, like human activists charged with about 50 t-shirts, which are attached to a joch-like stone on their shoulders.
Officers are still waiting for foods on their breakfast springs and there is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new spar account on Thursday afternoon because of all the world travel law.
Although I had stopped taking my debt timely on the safe late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase staff branches, about 20 people were snow.
Don't pay money to the banknotes, but to the customer service switcher where staff customers order cheque books, tourists ask the way to buy Macy's purchase and where to open new customers accounts.
Most of them before me, then I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with licence", were for the same reason as I am slaughter.
In contrast to me, however, they have already removed their refunds from smaller banks, in places from where they were walking, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and States Island.
They had money from such thrifts (a little bit of a building park), the association banks and those local sparcases that have only in one state and say they treat their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have passed quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with an investment of $327 billion, in concurrence management and as the last Friday of New Yorker on the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank, which was saved by $440 billion, on the search for a saved buyer.
In fear of another injury, the officers and laden employees stood before me with their bars to a bank that will be considered as safe ports, a bank responsible for the majority of salvation sales on Wall Street.
In the last weeks, the normal New Yorkers have reached financial latin.
A woman phoned in my Chinese tribe supper, with so much confidence, took reference to Lehman Brothers, the bank and the president of the president Dick Fuld, as if she were to be taught by a false colleague.
And Lyn, who is about the 50-year-old concierge of my residence block, has come from our usual entertainment theme about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my reliefs in money funds" she told me after I had been in the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslim graves shaken during the right-road in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a Left Judge of the Austrian Right Freedom Party of Austria, and Philip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams, takes the interest on Thursday, on 17 January 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerpes to represent the organization "Setted against Islamisation".
She's drawers in the style of the graphics on which a moschee is drawn, crossed with a red line.
The police accuses the legal extremists of the sepulchre on a Muslim Friedhof in Austria, at the same weekend, to the extreme right parties, to make significant profits in the election of the country.
On Friday night tonight tomorrow, more than 90 graves on the Friedhof were harmful in a organized action, according to the police.
The actors spread Jewish symbols such as the David Stars on some of the graves, but criminal officers believe this for an attempt to decrease the motive of extremists exposed by hate to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the case is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local islamic community said that they were "deepest insulted" about the message of the sepulchre, which was found as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans ended.
At the same time, in Austria, there is a sustainable science research after the country was drawn up at the right of the parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which received almost 30% of the votes, placed themselves in their election fight for a strike anti-immigrant law and some of their elections were criticized as an alien.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who wined 18% of the votes, took place for a prohibition of heads and Burkas and even denied its refusal against food that is generally connected to Islam.
At his last custom in Vienna, he spoke of a "brothership" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of moschees and minerals with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Questions and analyses conducted immediately after the election and the extreme rights of the political strongest block in the country indicate that this new development is based on young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, condemned by sexual abuse of children, was sentenced to travel to France and Spain.
The judge set up a six-month lock, after informing the controllers of it, he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was granted the last Thursday to join a foreign travel lock after presenting evidence to the judges of Glitter's prejudice for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, lived not at the Ashford official court in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning law office.
EIN speaker of the Court of Justice reported: " On Thursday, on 25 September, the police asked Kent at the official court Ashford to prevent foreign travels from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the director for sexual penalties, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel outside.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel outside for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned admission.
Revoking the notice of the authorities may lead to a 5-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said that she would not discuss any cases or glitters possible residence in the country.
One speaker of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to sing children in this country and in the foreign country."
"Our opinion is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the top of the police in Kent to sing the inhabitants of Kents and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual criminals in the country in order to minimize any risk for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for misuse of 2 girls in 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew glitter to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to flee to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the pass control, and he fled after some of them and went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter and he returned to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers claimed that he returned to Britain.
Too good Lettà, he arrived on 22 August in Heathrow, in Heathrow, on the terminal 3 and stayed there during his legal lawyer David Corker to Uxbri's office in West Londres, since Scotland Yard had requested authorisation to request that he register himself as sexual penalty.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for four months in the United Kingdom for the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Internal Ministry, the Internal Ministry Jacqui ́ith was empathy and satisfied that glitter was stopped to travel to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to keep his character', Günter Brauer, photograph.
No agreements, no breaks, no costs for the emergency.
The nature of the big flamescotteners who disturb the concurrence and dedicate themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed look like a woman or a man.
Artist One
Personality Other Pages
I look in life, in these moments, which are strange for the public, I know where I can find the depth of a steady knife or the depth of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to attend the stage.
Inside the project `Flamenco-people', the German photograph Günter Bauer represents a few inscenations on the stage with songs, dances and gitarists. On this side, he was a little for the artists.
With this proposal, the photograph creates a special icongraphy of the flamescoding at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the program of the month of the photograph of Flamenco reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which always increases from day to day, explains the artist and clears that `Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portrait are artists who are able to be on the stage of suffering, tristeness, joy, and so to move the public.
In order to keep the personality of these artists, no photography must be made on the stage.
Their personality and characters are in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to keep with the camera the characters of the largest flamecomesters.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph the songs, the gates or the dancer with a digital camera.
Thanks to the photo sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images produced that refer to classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means is the classic foundation of the image, which provides the image's modernity and idea of how the builder Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not only the dance, which is an instrumental game, but also the personality of the artist, his character, which with his art transfers the public.
The search for the essential, a certain thing that will be visible in the form of the hearing, of his own, is and was the fixed goal of this work that will be presented next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Known persons in Flamenco are Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyo, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became anthology of Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer suffering to the portrait led him to react this idea two years ago and to perform as 'Portret of the Veterans of the Sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, I like the photograph to `I like to photograph the people, to know them and to move me in their lives, whether it's for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult gateway.
You're going to meet or break on persons, personalities you sometimes don't know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to make a photo.
Except these circumstances, as a photograph, I always try to perform my ideas."
The collection of the portrait of Flamencos from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is published in the gallery of El Fotómata, located on the street with the name la calle de la Mata and passed parallelly to the route la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa states that the Rome, which he just writes, is 'a talent'.
He does not know where the Romans' action is located and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to make the project in which he was just going forward, a Roman with the Protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived 20 years in Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, while his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel pricemaker admitted that the project with which he is occupied is 'a customs ability' and 'all indicates that he does not have to write the Roman'.
'If I had been obscured, I wouldn't have done it, but I'd hope to do it and ever end the Roman, so he took his participation in the Festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists, and thousands of people in Segovia.
The author of 'La city y los perros' was one of the most excellent personalities on the Festival and made proofs.
Vargas Llosa, the premium of the festival Hay Festival, and gives to the majority of the presents their voice, is compared to the old exhibition of `Our mutual friend' and is to see in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and determined that he had a public before himself, which noticed that the Peruanian, who wanted to experience a wonderful memory and a great humor feeling, was not given enough time to pass again: how his vocation to literature came from `excellent adventure loss', from `Freude at reading' and `more than it shows; how he wrote and `Dis ́s observed' to add `the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with document, the number of corrections and reviews that he made; such as the faulcants, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas's, and which are the images of his history.
The Spanish Roman writer concluded that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books can change the life, but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure interview, a flexible experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it's called 'effects' and 'the people brings more out', therefore I asked the writers 'not to leave the facility' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather was not played with: the steel campsite fell partially.
Following the announced steel travellers found that the ground of the place was in bad state, the steel campsite was transferred to the feast in Pozoblanco last morning.
Thus, with the understanding of Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Hernández decided to move the steer campsite.
Thus the festival of the inconsistent interpretation was exposed, therefore two of the three feasts were not able to find place.
On Saturday, it was not able to raise the second planned campaign.
The group of Matadors was of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who followed and followed the steel campaigns.
There was just a party on Friday.
The winner of that was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after whom he had left with joy and isthetics.
At the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two corners and one ear of the stirs, which was more to him by galopping than by his striking art.
And even worse El Julie, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he had been so bad, a majority of the public reacted in the second battle with buh-ruffen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was charged with two thousand kilo hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Verage controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon, Álava.
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, but they took the flight.
It looked like they had not to stop with the loading of more than two thousand kilo hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who was 28 years old, as A. A. J., as told by the Government of Basken.
The arrested person was accused of trade and falsehood of documents.
The incident occurred when the police officers of the region Álava had already completed the control of the N-1 and passed through the city of Arminon.
They decided to keep a car to perform the road controls. The driver did not follow the instructions, urged suddenly the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped a few kilometers at the border street. At the moment, the drivers went out of the car to flee through a country road to a forest area.
The police of the city Ertzaintza got one of the two. In the car, a Iveco Daily, they transported 2,178 kg Haschish, which was arrested by the police.
The first part of the car was loaded with hashish bounds, led later to the precise laboratory analysis and the division of the bonds to other police offices.
The officers determined that the identifier was 'double' so that it did not comply with the identifier specified in the Kfz papers, therefore an arrest was made for false documents.
The police of the city Ertzaintza continues to investigate in order to prevent the arrest of the second sentence, who, as already said, could flee, but also determine the origin of the subjects.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was introduced to a police office and will be sent to the court in the next hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested because of the carrier under the effect of an unknown medicine.
Heather Locklear, who is the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested at this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of the conduct under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness has observed how she tried to run out of her parking lucky in Montecito in a very rare way, reported the speakers of the police of California to the magazine 'People'.
The Witness reported detailed that Locklear `from 16:30 a.m. Gaspedal made a lot of warm by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lucky, and when she went back, she took a few times at her sunbright'.
Something later the Witness, who first had probably not recognized that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and went out the car.
The Witness was the person who announced the needy service because she had `Anest lived for Locklears'.
When the police officer arrived, they found the watchman sitting in her car, which was strange on the street, and thus blocked the department.
'It seemed to be unoriented,' therefore they made the police in a special range of alcohol and alcohol to test.
According to a police speaker, the cooperative, excessive alcohol, was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of officers followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medical team', as the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the contempt to be carried under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought in a local investigation at 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arına, where he was treated against most conditions and depressions.
Llamazares include that the andalusian association of the United States Links is responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and the United States members of the United States, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former town Council for Youth and Sport in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, which was returned last week after he was accused to make business with family members.
'In such cases I am a large federalist, and the andalusian organization will be the one who must take the responsibility for it', the Lamazares pointed out what steps the party must have towards the one who is sitting as a Council of Civil in the community of Sevilla.
However, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible studies of the rules of violations which Silva could have started: 'The VL always was to be the maximum transparency of such cases'.
In view of this, he emphasized that education has a strict ethical code for all public entities.
`Sangre de Mayo': Heldenbook von Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' is the overseer version of the famous rebellion of Spain against the French. This is a wonderful film in the film, with about 15 million euro investment for the road work.
In this way, the Cineast tried to present a number of personalities and social analysis, which he always wondered at the works of the famous Roman writer, said Carci today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevaria at the beginning of a long list of representatives.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and half hours, is presented in China this Friday and later shown on the sender Telemadrid as a four-hour minisery.
José Luis Garci, a large fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to his ‘kind stream’, he had to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who commanded him by the autonomous community Madrid three years ago to turn a movie to the second century celebration of 2 November in Madrid. In particular, because the history based on’Episodios Nationales’, he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community Madrid, offers Garci, as he adds, the ‘unique opportunity’ using Dekor and the relevant clothing of the `conflicted Spain, which was chosen by the false leader for the battle because the people had been represented by the fight for the independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of the VII.
However, the Cineast suffers that financing such as `Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times higher than `Sangre de mayo') could not be calculated, therefore, some scenes from the draftbook with Horacio Valcárcel, with Garci, almost all his cars, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a director of the film in 'Volver a empezar', has been involved by his usual works: he was on the stage to the players with whom you must first try before you start to rotate, and for those who have not made casting, he appears ‘needing’ and respecting, ‘a part of the profession of the director is to provide assistance in the theater and in the cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which you are doing’.
The representatives on whom he strikes in 'Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-Kandidat in four nominations (of whom he has won) is the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates representing Spain before the Actionmy of Hollywood in this year represents a young generation of the Spanish movie. No 'Sangre de mayo' nor 'Seate mesas de billar francés' and s日 not the selected movie 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect exhibitions for this movie.
'In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for the cup, and now you're satisfied when you have produced a movie', explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls the reminder of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamencottener from Sevilla honors a dancer that also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalana (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the fourth Triana and when she was three years old, her family was around London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighting girls for the Emaneation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistin, vegetarian, and seated for the destruction of the corse, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her tracks in the Dance and Estetic Revolution in Europe in the time between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa°roa and she proposed to me this role that would not happen to me.'
'We are not trying to tell her about her life to keep her spirit,' said the flamencottener.
Your dance foundations helped me very much in Flamenco.
'The dance of the Schmetterlings', for example, came to me like Guajira, or 'the dance of the serpents' like Tango.
Her dance was meaningful and I was told that my dance was also in this eastistic area, she claims.
The inscenation calculates two exceptional cooperation: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of its ideas, as he also did in `La Porta abierta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, which would have to work with one of its ex-schools.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very nice personality.
I am happy because she agreed to work in my work, and I feel very honourable."
The inscenation also includes musical composite and the most important Jesus Torres and Ariaga, with Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, and the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the spectator Juanfra Juarez, he overcomes the role of the companion of the artists who were the Divas, in which he continued to trust."
In this work, it is also reported in a certain way of life of this woman, who has been born in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, even though it has usually lived in London.
`I wanted to call her back in memory because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain period and whose works are no more today and that is why they are less appreciated', says Bayón.
The presentation will be located at 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recent marido' includes also the Trinity
The presentation of the first illustrated series of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out a planned Action in the mission of the Andalus Council for Culture in order to celebrate the `Trien' of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is the memory of the fiftyth Jubileum of the delivery of the literature price and the death day of the two.
Thus `the Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new exhibition of this work, with the international congress, found in New York City, with the restoration of the House Museum by Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the `Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'A chopo de light' opened in May, and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, New York is now reached and presented during the international congress.
The andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pedro Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the andalusian world divorce.
The United States can feel bad without Paul Newman
`Thus times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This set comes from the spectator Sally Field, who joined him in `Sensation reporter', and from the then governing representation of the American Chinese, which was left in the midst, came from all America to Newman with his pleasant idea and followed her.
Now see what she costed to give him Oscar.
And when he returned 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, it was a big shot for everyone.
'What one time feels is essentially more than a expression, and now I have lost a big friend', Robert Redford said weeping, 'My life and my country were the greatest trials of his life.'
No one had to make it ridicule or overcome.
As the father of China and the country, he died at a triumphous moment in which he rules before terrorists and before the market breaking, where the low self-sensitivity of the American Americans in the unexpected search for reasons for retaining worth is.
If in this heavy time without discipline only a few people you can be amazed, you must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he covered nearly a platformic idea of beauty and truth.
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and was like a variety of losses as well as wins: from the foundation that wrote to the fight against the and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, was founded up to his own mark of householders and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country where it costed him a lot of effort to endure against a mortal nutritional culture.
A wide whale of the surprise is higher than Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel, realized that not only one man died, but all the time.
The English Sam Mendes, director of the movie and Oscar prices, said that the work with Newman was no longer or less than the top of his car.
Crowe, the wicked boy who came out, waited for Newman to be his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the biggest of all of us', instructed by George Clooney, maybe one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman lived: receive high requirements for justice, a responsibility-conscious life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's median hole.
But there's someone trying it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He left himself divorced once and was then married fifty years after Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there was certainly many opportunities to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a filet home?' he often shout himself.
In heaven, he will be proud of that his daughters on earth have the same view as his fans, which is not usual in America.
'From all the great roles that he played, he was not so proud as the faithful marriage, the loving father, the watchful grandfather, and the Philanthrophes,' they say.
For the Olympics games the streets in Madrid are missing.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to make some olympical dishlines in Madrid, according to the screen for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask me, ‘Shall we prepare for it?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say it's not right!
She was embraced as a perfect road, and after my evaluation, she was the worst road with all the drum and dress that was there.
Of course, this is a lot of insensitivity if you were looking at the evaluation and I could check it, that would not have happened clearly.
But we're going to go through everything from the beginning.
The noise starts with the ticket hall that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad to me, but if they let you go, then they should also give you everything (including Chip to avoid the washing on the street).
Don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first uncertainty that contains it is to go there only because it's why) and (after an infinite lock) there's the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second unconsciousness because I need the XL size)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis, only small, much more billiged hazards were decided to buy from smaller substances?
So well, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Unless you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting snow of at least 15 minutes and, too, you have to leave the rock sack.
The waiting has suffered more than 35 minutes, which in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected is unintelligent.
As it was to expect, the street started and we didn't let our backs go, even if it had been possible, but it would have been weaker.
In these 40 minutes, it seemed to wait after rain, so it was trying to organize a people's rebellion and to overcome the hawk.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have long burning and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification, I can think that the outcome has been wrong-handed.
Of course, if you would ask me for a perfect road, this road would never touch me.
So I think we will dream from a city that is well prepared for the Olympics games
Microsoft on search for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', performed by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intellectuality without a lot of intellectuality, which, however, is able to carry out some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a routine planner to move on the campus of the company). The system notes what it hears during the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a form- and visual identification system, these `receptionists' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their interview.
It can also organize the attendants in the groups according to the discussions.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notes a person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that speaks with her, and that it is not a company employer.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screen saver
Impressing
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things that it can handle, for example the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week you were very surfacely talking about Microsoft's change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer stated that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial M., they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, it will be just for the minors.
Everything is only a detection if you think that Microsoft in Windows versions adds one or more function and 'Extras'.
The direction change will be recompensed
Microsoft has the right, the operational system loses all-time importance, just as the software.
When Google Chrom occurred in the network, it was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many show that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an inconsistent part, will always be necessary to work hardware and software simultaneously.
The operational system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it is about to communicate to his wife.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of his 'Dead', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the activation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, for more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute Firefox, Explorer or Chrom and we spent more time every day in surf than in the 'Window' environment.
What are the helps used in the computer for available applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be compacter, much more compacter than Vista.
Lighter, not so overwhelmed, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more in integrating his online services, which can then become the alternatives to Google.
In fact, they need this, without doubt. I bring a little example of it.
I made the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refrigerator rubber, a guard is fixed: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independence concluded that the 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google used for the network research.
Furthermore, last week was also assured that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not start, but the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft looks for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the same occasion.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuloso Marcel
Paul Picasso had it in Costa A ́ inhaha ́,° di Caprio had this mark in `Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, just as Alıtino in `The Pate' of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to a well-built patrol.
If we begin to count the innumerable stars emergences, we can return to the picture of a very powerful man, with a witch bar, which has highlighted heights in a wader circle.
In fact, it is a typically manly T-shirt of woodwool, unemployed and tailed.
The English speakers call it 'tank', but the Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, it is called 'Marcel' in a close circle. The legend said that the name resistance is connected to sport and the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the song Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surprises all because of his excellent woodwool, because of its distinct unisex-snitte, and appears through a small belgical fan (as not recognible) which have these T-shirts as detail in the knife.
And respect, the Belgian company could not only refer to the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, hosen from woodwolves, T-shirts with strips, babys, Mini Shorts
Modeled and fair underwearing.
Yet, it's very damage to use it as a subheading.
You're very proud.
'I will be a young mother; I will not worry about the Candidate.'
Her great emergency with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica'z is great but full of life's pleasure.
Currently, the sisters Grouz take their new activities in the very serious.
For Monica, this is essentially more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their call.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, where she moved her residence and also presents the most important premies in the Spanish house sponsored.
Compassionate and swimming, winner on the short streets.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this herbst/Winter Saison, which my sister and I had decided to present for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second series of `Mango Fashion Awards' and shared the dinner at Valentinos Honor.
A very intense working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the foundation of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I'm fascinated by the film of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combinate their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, shower and Lord, you're a very multilateral woman, isn't you?
I think yes, but s, everything happens in one and these areas have many communities.
Since I was small, I was disappointed by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get in the clothes of my tent and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a free-time park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of the clothes.
You know, we love dancers so much to have our own style in teaching and at the samples to look in the mirror and feel well about it.
As a shower, when you get the cost, you turn into the real role of presentation.
S_, everything is connected together, it is so, a lot of respect for the cost designer and their professionality.
You've been 30 years ago, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever than 30 years old.
I think that the woman will be reef, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistake.
I don't have anything to do because of my biological hour.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was small, and that has given me much more inner joy.
So you think to be a mother, right?
For a long time, I know that I will be a mother, because that requires my body, and I will be a young mother; that I will not let me escape.
I don't worry about the candidate.
I'll give my child a lot of happiness and learn it with love.
As regards the movie art, you keep in the eyes the works you shared and turned the last year.
That's exactly what I want to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very insatisfactory and inconscient and I want to have everything once that, of course, cannot be immediately.
I wish that `The Last Hour' and 'En search de la tumba de Christ' were first listed.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you've been on the running with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say something like that.
It's not that I went to the running to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known since a while, has simply called me and invited me to London to share in a parade for the well-being event of their organization `women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothing pieces from our collection for Mango were increased to collect the money for Naomis NGOs.
The people don't know Naomi's heart.
I, as the one who knows, would tell you that they don't.
Yet, I will submit this thing in which it is shared.
She asked me to share in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstanding, I'll do that too.
To subscribe to women in the third world, whatever is needed.
The cars that can be delayed because of the alcohol level will need to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority recommends that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level installs inside the car of this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drinking state. If he is alcoholized, the car will not be touched.
The initiative has been announced in June last month and is now part of the report of the Advocate-General.
The aim is to resocialize the driver, so this is a course for the development of the constitutional behaviour.
Besides the General State Advocate, according to the expertise, will also participate in the Ministry of Affairs and the establishment of the Technical Institute for Car Safety.
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of the car drivers shown more than once because of the carrier under alcohol influences, replaced by tax.
The `alcohol' would prevent it because it is connected to the car, it loses the alcohol content in the spread air and prevents autostart when the driver has tested alcohol; or if a alcohol convergence is detected as permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are made by the one who commits the sanction.
In this regard, a dictionary conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices would prevent up to 65% of the rules of violation in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, 115 people can be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a criminal.
In order to facilitate their introduction, a legislative reform can be implemented on the usual way, however, a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal persecution process.
The device on the Spanish markets is still not available in any business, although it has already been built in some of the public transport vehicles and vehicles.
The House of Deputy will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Worker Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British pointing at 17:40, for the time prescribed by the program, near the presidial hangar of the Benito Juárez de Mexico DF, the aircraft of Spanish aircraft traveled with the prince and prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but its radiations have still forced to use the hand as sunset to see the kingly couple that went out of the flight.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish Messenger and other authorities
A few hours ago, I had asked a taxi driver on the street whether he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very well, so, there you can't take people around this hour you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she has spent a few years here.
- Oh, yeah, that's all right.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princes of Asturies are and knows the importance of traveling.
There are many who wait in the Hangar of the airport and the Red Teppy, including military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give the honor salve.
The prince seems laughing, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with a long hair weakened by the wind, without the usual 'peep-toes', may have been told her that it was expected a witcher in DF.
Before they arrive in the room, they laugh and are prepared for the photographs in which the official result is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are sent, one of the four largest in the city, waits for her a repository from the Mexican TV that makes a pleasant division.
The best premium of the
There was probably no more place in the world than Paris to present a premium of the Property and there was probably no significant designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second part of the competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the support and international increase of young people.
This is exposed to a price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first department, yesterday has seen its drawings on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost weighted because of the emotional exhibition.
In addition, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened, which offers a sale area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is located in London.
So many events have occurred that are associated with that you want to thank the designer Valentino for his jury president in the competition. All ended with a Luxus dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surrounding of many famous people, the table that Mango organized was seemed to be special.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken from the pain because his brother died recently, was stuck together. He took the cup from the house and took some nice things of ELAH, which were breathing. He kept on his son's arm, who was nearly two metres big and had Valentino accompanied at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and Lord of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended with the baron of Red Schild without Jackett, because Jacketts gave the lady.
Monica, and had a wood and a cup that she had modeled, and to dinner, she brought a long, black sexy clothes. When a night pass through the operas, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was advised, remembered the old times, took a stone and made a species `grand pie'.
Inés Sastre, she didn't touch the pass through the spaces of the palace, but she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice over the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always calls a stormful pleasure, and on Jon Traë, who requested to have a room without a holiday after his arrival (with his own beds and hands) at the Hotel International in Paris.
The stars under the starful heaven of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There's not 1000, but one more opportunity to forget the chaotic life of all day.
And even if there are few, all are collected in a book where it is how to get relaxed. The book comes into the bookworks on 30 September.
The wecker is a punishment when he sounds at 7 a.m. in the morning, but even worse the idea appears to come into the hectic rhythmus, which requires the current life.
The office is the spending and the computer that leads to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and two methods to fight the daily creation and the problems that disable the work world.
However, the number increases, not less than 1001.
Besides Yoga, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott provides in the book the entire list of options adapted to the fun and time of each individual.
The work against the stress calls `1001 opportunities to relax' and thus the rest that the book provides comes into the bookworks of the Verlag Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks it is impossible to gain rest in areas such as workspace with personal contacts, this manual resists such faith.
The methods are offered to remain in contact with the nature or the 100% natural recepts that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenalin no longer grows up in your venes to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to be added to the sofa, to disable the brain and to converge on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some children speak night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us what happened on the day before, but the children who speak during the sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in fact it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep stuff that is called the speech in sleep.
She is very spread, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you talked night.
This phenomenon may occasionally occur (one time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (each day, one time per week, one time per month), the next day the child can not remember anything.
There is no one reason that causes this appearance.
Combinations with other appearances in sleep are often searched for, such as alptroms, panishest night, Enuresis noctura (slaughter night), searching speech in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have learned earlier, it can be a very high fiber, stress, or transfer.
In any case, it's a little research phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak hardly in individual words, flourish or it can be an opposite (scream, weeping, long discussions).
In cases in which the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to advise a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes and thus occurs.
We said that it is a positive sight, so it will not be treated, unless it is connected to another sleeping station that can be treated (e.g. with the sleep-apnoe or the stress).
What you can do is implement a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to get the child up before sleeping.
So, choose a safe game for the child and avoid stressy TV programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children whose relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some internal rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When the speech comes to sleep once, it trys to keep the rest.
Remember that it is ungrateful for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember what is done.
Useful advice
Don't wake up.
This is unusual, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it's quiet.
If you remember that after a couple of occurrences, it is recommended to give advice or find out why the child has the reason for the child.
If they understand what it says (what is not so usual), the child doesn't press to perform an approval and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
You will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it is because they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you take out of it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a shit.
That's a lot of cause.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Out of houses... end
After a long dust stretch, Ill houses on the game field are finally back to success.
Without great effort, the yellow-swarms played numerous towers and made it possible to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The time of this meeting, at which the strict efforts to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest Captain Buffmann, whose television shooter was soon on the angle, Illhouse houses should have easily dominated the game, and it was successfully changed first founder flics with a television shooter, then brain with a high pass, and Roman with a shot with a football to demand the delay of Denmark.
The genetic mastership blocked in the field centre and left only the living Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half time should be determined with two towers struck by Riahi and Temporale, and then with the first gate for the Illhouse by Marais, which was exactly right to become a bowl again in a first trial of Diebold.
However, the illhusic ports should not be able to enjoy his happiness long and to be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his colleagues had to continue to play along.
However, Denmark was not able to use this and did not face any big problems with an illusionous elephant that just moved a little back to 'defence' their defence, except in the last seconds of the game, where the ball passed very close to the latte.
Sarkozy matches wrath fishermen
Before he goes to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a sticker in the Bretagne.
In view of the disappointed attitude of the fishermen who blocked the passengers to several Bretonian and Norway ports on Monday, the French president decided to enter the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
Last persons expect to receive him 'with a spirit' and hope that he comes with 'specific proposals'.
At the same time, the Chairman is located as a general assembly of the crisis committee based by the British fishermen to implement measures with regard to the extreme increase in the diet price, which has reached an average value of over 1,14 euros per liter.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée Palace, David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies resume competitiveness, and to ensure the conditions of work and payment of the maritime.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishers with delicateness.
On Wednesday morning, they brought in the Morbihan and Calvados Protest March, which caused the washing of almost ≥ 1 km long.
The seal gate of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle isle are not disconnected.
The half-seal of Quiberon has been locked with a lock.
Once on Monday, the mariners express their disappointment by burning them from early morning to rivers and palettes before brest and Lorient ports, while keeping them in Concarneau or Saint-Brie.
The movement was based on other halls of the Atlantic coast and the channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendea, where the fishing coats were not exported, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the Manover of the trade boats.
The fishers of Turball and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved the blockage of the significant total raffiny in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting at middle-week in the Ministry before they decided about possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsibility of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The streek will continue' because 'the fishermen will not be abandoned at any point' and 'nothing will go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Committee on Fisheries of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on this is costing the liter currently about 50 cents, but they believe that the rental limit of a boat can only be reached for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman of the wonderful
The unforgettable representative of `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died in the age of 83 years in the consequences of cancers in house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, were dismissed from the Chinese and engaged player Paul Newman, who died in 83 years of age.

AIG would take into account more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the forsurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the election of the Ananian election, is to give more than 15% of its assets to repay the 85 billion awarded to him.
AIG is ready to tax the sale of a large part of their business, their life insurance at international level and their age in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Management Board met Saturday evening to verify possible sales.
No operation could be achieved in the AIG.
The assets from which AIG might be separated belong to its International Lease Financial Corp, their 59% share in the reassuranced Transatlantic Holdings, and their immobility and their investment in the Equity, the FT continues.
With regard to these sales, no definitive decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG must take the sales as soon as possible to recover the loans over 85 billion who have allowed her to pay the reserves, including the risk that the authorities receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders are lost at the same level.
Analysis History Paris of the session History morning-Meeting
The New Yorker Börse reported on Monday after the representative room had refused the Plan Paulson to save the banks, a historical case of the course: The Dow Jones lost 6,98%, never lost about 800 points, and on Wednesday 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is at 777.68 points on 10.365,45 points.

After the unexpected delay of the plan to save the banks through the ladies' room, which should re-contain stability on the markets, together the Wall Street, which was already offered at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against, and 205 votes refused the funding secretary Henry Paulson to ask for.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
'This is a bad image that represents the Congress as unable to become a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counted on this plan', it adds, and fears that a project 'to late' comes in several days.
`If the project is actually condemned to the cover..., it will be a quick task of the Fed (the Central Bank, Anm. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis into the crisis, which would be more restricted by the credit conditions', Brian Bethune, the Economy Boss of Global Insight.
And Mrs Piegza stressed the feeling of extreme difficulty, which is still more than every day, which extends the ruin of a financial undertaking in the United States.
After the concurrence of Washington Mutual on Friday, the Ananian authorities planned the rent of the banks of Wachovia through its competitive citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis was suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the countries of Benelux, Island and Germany, a sign that the markets were not only confronted with a global crisis, but also with a global crisis.
The market for basic needs is strongly weakened.
The income of the state cash in the period of ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ 3,632% was reduced from 3,827% by Friday evening to 3,827% and the income within 30 years of yesterday evening from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first television
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday followed another to find out who was winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced to the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats their own victory in this television dual, which should be followed by a third of the families.
The political analytical David Gergen appreciates that John McCain's performance, despite the significant, was not `brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election issues five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, published on Saturday a review of opinion, is based on Obama with five points forward (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democracy makes the best figure clearly.
In the still uncomfortable electors, so those to whom it is now, Obama was 39% of the winners, while 25% of them, according to a CBS investigation, viewed McCain as winners.
Obama should expect his advance on Thursday with the good performance that Joseph Biden's complainant will expect in the first and only public debate with his Rivalin Sarah Palin.
`It would be a mistake to subestimate them.
She has instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop dealing with his undeserved experience in the field of external policies and clearly submitting the 'naivity' of his adversary to these issues which constituted the central point of this first television duty.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I don't believe that Senator Obama provides about the needed experience and the need to be president', he also assured.
An attack has been preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself shortly and precisely without leaving himself out of the replacement.
He rejected his ability to make decisions and renew the picture that the world has from the United States.
`McCain has not yet understood, however, Obama has set a democracy electoral appointment this week, which was proposed in the Republican, not to see the total amount of the crisis which was loaded on the 'Amer' Amer from the street.
`In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama broke on 20,000 people yesterday before they eventually had gathered a choice in North Carolina in a flowing rain.
He did not even mention the words `medle-state' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis provides Obama, which the Americans think the most appropriate to save the economy even at the border of the background, a clear benefit.
'The next week could be a decision-making point', assessed yesterday the influenced democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an earlier member of the Government of Clinton, compares the 'good economic instinct' Obamas with those by Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the conclusion of a eight-yearly bad economic policy which has been implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After remarking that he would even be able to reduce the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the deficiencies in the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a hospital insurance system, had the highest priority for him.
However, McCain wanted to create an installation of 45 nuclear powers until 2030.
The two candidates are focused on the issues that have been discussed on the plan for the salvation of the Finance over 700 billion euros (470 billion euros), which were discussed by the Congress yesterday evening and is extremely disappointed to the people.
'Have you noticed that in Minsk a choice was found?'
Youths and oppositional demonstrated Sunday evening on the main place of the white-rush capital to reject the results of Parliament's elections.
Some hundred white roses gathered Saturday evening since the elections were closed on the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the disgusting character of Parliament's elections.
Although no result was reported, many youths came to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukekenko: 'The Dictator must return'.
Some say that they have not chosen, 'What does this benefit if they do with my voice what they want?' says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime shown to the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of visa for 40 leading white-rush personalities and the recovery of certain assets, could be cancelled if these elections were considered cleanly.
According to opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded by the election committees and our observers were not able to participate in the statement,' the sustained Juri Potemkin, the press speaker of the Union of Democratic Powers, a closer combination of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the election of the presidency 2006 and leader of the Pro-Europe Motion, because it is important to speak the votes, and this is the executive with us.
If the members of the Opposition enter into Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not chosen.
But their introduction into Parliament can mean the time of television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore due to a political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because when our economy, which is strongly debt to Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run to become a Protector of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition prejudices that the European Security and Cooperation Organization, who has followed the election, does not recognize the election as a valid.
It emphasizes that the election share numbers appear too high and that the extension of the vote tax in front (26% of the Minsk electors) has introduced the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a choice has been found?', asked the leader of the social democracy Alexander Ko ́in, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who are in the first place in accordance with the views of the Government.
The silence of the night slows back over the October place.
In television, President Luachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.
Underview - From blood that has become secure again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday on the 10th anniversary of its creation, and her president, Dr. Francine Decary, had all reasons for rejoicing because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most safe and efficiently blood banks in the world.
And in particular, it has restored the confidence of the public, which was hardly shot by the scandale from the dead blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross were tested with the HI-virus and hepatitis C-virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the disapproval of the public, the Government of Canada introduced in February 1994 a public investigation conducted by the judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to prepare directives to prevent such a renewed disaster.
The Court of Justice Craver still insisted on submitting his report, at that time several provinces set a committee on the feet, whose goal was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservations in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Cancer, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide other provinces and both territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took their job, nearly 38% of people trusted in the blood conservation system in Quebec, reported Dr. Decary.
The situation was disappointing.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and by working in this area during the following years, we have returned the confidence of the public," she proudly emphasises that at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary has awareness that 'confidence is something extremely disrupt'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of perspective.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of many cases of the human form of cattle in Europe, a new kind of creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, which has been guided since 1998.
'And we didn't have the lowest idea of whether this disease could be overtaken by blood.
Thus, we call on one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which, as a result, is to apply exclusive measures if you don't know this and if a disease only progress slowly, as it is obvious of the illness of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death unnecessaryly.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who have stayed longer than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt evidence that this illness will overcome blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of the perspective we have applied has a meaning.
In 1999, there is a much more precise technology to recognize HIV: Nuclear acid test (NST) that allows to prove directly the appearance of the virus himself in the blood of the sold, not the anti-corps against the virus, as was in the case used before.
The NST enabled to reduce the incubation time between the time when the person was entered and the place where the first virus could be demonstrated by our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a period of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain benefits could be inherited, without knowing it, and that could not be recognized, is essentially reduced.
These improvements allowed AIDS to decrease significantly the risk of blood transfusion of AIDS.
Today, one of the 12 million people runs to receive HIV in blood.
`In other words, it means that 12 million blood conservations should be distributed before someone was signed with HIV.
Since Hema Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preservations each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV over a blood preserve.
I think you can feel like today if you get or write a blood transfusion to restore the health, the Hema Quebec Director's headquarters.
`Our challenge for the next years is to obtain the safety of our products.
No one knows what illness is able to get into the system.
First in the past year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, just as the Westnil virus, will be translated by insects over blood.
We have to monitor uninterruptedly, Dr. Decary continues before it points out that Hema Quebec has to provide adequate supply beyond a safe supply.
`The need is growing because the population is old.
As treatments for cancer treatment are aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood cells.
The overage of the population is also affected by the blood penetration, in which the average only 3% of the populations suitable to the blood are in Quebec. '
All healthy persons who are 18 or older and are satisfied with the compatibility criteria every 56 days, so six times per year, blood.
In the average, 14% of those who provide their blood will not be accepted because they are diseased by AIDS or Malaria, and those who are traveling into a country in which Malaria is spread will be excluded from blood for a year.
With this 3% we can get an inventar that meets the needs of the hospitals.
No suggestions are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this spender network when they are older and no blood can be more.
It is difficult to convince people of sling blood, but especially to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Today, life is so hectic that you often find the time to carry a hour during blood," Francine Decary suspects.
With an annual budget of 297 million ECU Hema Quebec provides not only blood conservations, but also human weights, including bone transplants, heart clothing, eggs and skin, which are almost used in severe burning disorders.
These weights will be examined, refrigerated and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public Nabel-snurblood bank Quebecs.
In the nabel snuck, considered previously biomedical waste, there are rich blood cells that can serve to treat severe diseases such as leukemia.
'For a few weeks, we celebrated the establishment of our thousands of Nabel snubble samples, and we plan to stay more than a thousand years ago.
'We should be able to start in the beginning of the next year to provide it for transplant', says Dr. Decary, which describes this programme of Nabelschnurblute as a very popular.
Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it, because Hema Quebec was missing the means to offer this complex and valuable program in all hospitals Quebecs.
Soccer - Impact in Halbfinal
Montreals Impact was yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-siges (4 to 3 with all gates) against the Sounders from Seattle during the second and decided game of the quarter final series in Saputo station, in which the total port proportion was qualified for the halffinal round of the games of the first liga of the USL.
The Middlefield player Antonio Ribeiro shook the decisioning gate in the ninety-minute game.
After a first half time without the gate, both for the one and the other side, the Mediterranean players David Testo and Rocco Plan ́no landed the other matches for the training of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Remember that when the first game of the front and back game on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, the Seattles had introduced a 2 to 1-download in a premium.
In half-final Impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday evening, Thunder could compare a 3 to 1-depth in Minnesota by a 4 to 3-sea, but the Whitecaps with a total port proportion of 5 to 4 yet in the halffinal round.
Impact will certainly have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Shortly said - winners by Kovalev
The number 1-trio of the Canadian community is ready to attack the season.
Last evening, the unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn formed the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, which leaded to a 3 to 2-seek.
Costitsyn, the Star of Meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two models and Kovalev converted a pass in this winning game, the fourth of the three colors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev gained the victory by shooting the only gate of all the shooting.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel.
`He has fixed himself too much in the first half time, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a storm attack. '
Charest is set north
The Prime Minister does not exclude, not before the end of the year of election.
Once the general assembly of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest went last night to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Li日) tried to be chosen in today's sub-election.
`The history of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented last night with visual funds at the assembly of the Liberal Party Quebecs in Levi, and followed the entire guidelines.
In the currency of his report, a species of images was projected behind him.
On three large screens, special images of water powers, mountain works, watched by Quebec in 'Google Maps', land maps, etc.
Great funds like during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would keep the choices of this herb, even if he believed that his appointment calendar was very full.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'visition' which the Prime Minister has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space', which provides an agreement with France on work forces, a agreement between Canada and Europe and ontario agreements.
Although it was often learned in the speech of the Prime Minister in the past, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th broad grade - never was the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister had limited to explain why the North was a 'ground potential' jubilee, but no date, no investment sums or exact priorities for the future projects.
At least some views on what could be made more: in particular on water energy, in the forest, but in particular on the mountain building sector, contributed by the growth of the countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The recording of Mr. Charests follows the North . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This Family's two-fold as large as France' is near our, is in Quebec.
It's not only close to us, it's in us, he stressed how to clearly show that he's looking for a national basic dream.
Quebec was very weakened by his connection to the north, and he stressed: the street to gold in Abitibi, the Quebec technology, the James Booth.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he adds after he has introduced a theatrical pause to look at the great card behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec region, includes a part of Labrador with which Quebec has always been invited, stated the Prime Minister of Press.
`This is a traditional attitude that followed all governments.
There is a border line in which there has been no agreement for a long time, when the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again in the name of the Government,” he explained.
'We have to think about our vision from the north,' he explained and spoke about the Northwest passage that will be able to be able to be able for the whole year because of the iron milk.
In this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the inhabitants of the inhabitants, and the inside?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would handle them very usefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (earlier peking deputy of Hungava) have already initiated consultations in about 30 communities.
A ministerial committee conducted by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Assessment) has taken a important place, has taken the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, not a gipfel, but a opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will remain in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally, it promises.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the Liberal Prime Ministers before him.
`When the Liberals before us were in the office, we went around to transform the challenges in new growth and development chances.
Moreover, this was one of the topics of the weekend that were always opened on Friday with a large cocktail party at the festival of the 50th Jubilea.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the force of Beauharnois to Adelard-Godbout stadium.
'On Godbout, who created the Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which reached the quiet revolution and the constitution of the water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James-Book, always knew our party to determine the future', explained Jean Charest.
In contrast to the press, he took reference to another, this time, conservative prosecution, and to the programme `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest emphasises its implementation for 2012.
'This remains among us, but I'm able to be therein,' he trusted his members, which was made in those chains.
The Prime Minister, who said that there would be no choice in April 2008, and, of course, 2009, has in fact not yet the possibility of keeping this herbst a choice which is possible for him from the law.
He emphasises that his appointment calendar is, however, full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a bullet between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Participant a platform from nationalist plans, in particular from 'the objectives of the Constitution' which have been adopted without further adoption: the PLQ requires particularly the recognition of the 'Behaviority of Quebecs' in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec names the members of the Council of Canadian and remote accessories and that these are a Veto in relation to the decisions in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken with scepsia.
The Chef of the Partie Quebécois, Pauline Marois, has resumed the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Government has introduced Landry 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when she reached the power in 2003, declined to apply them.
If she had done it, we would have been a lot more today, Mrs. Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (when the election is located today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed the adoption of a North plan by the Government.
'But what we want is that this is not just a great idea', said Sebastien Proulx party leader in a representation for Mario Dumont, who comes from the vacation today.
Letters - A disappointed country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justiz' minister (which Irony) in the Cabinett Harper was the last summer allowed to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'scan' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unfinished fight for justice and has deserved all our admiration to cover such a shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that has not taken home their landsman captured in the Guantanamo Conservation camp as one of the countries concerned.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was a younger one than the things that would be predicted to him.
The only government, who, despite the fact that Canada has undergone the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to avoid it under unhuman conditions.
The only one who is going to a parody of justice to appreciate the debt of the complaint.
We recall that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian advocates are planning to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a righteous process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes before the folters: it is little interested that a young awakeer after so many years will certainly be broken up forever.
We are not yet conscious of this, but we just experience a domestic circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, that the harper always brings before it, and it sounds not so sad out of the mouth.
So there is a time in which there is no more moral: a Canadian citizen can be mishandled, foolish and unlocked, completely according to the goods of a Governing Boss, which is supported by the minority until today (they may belong to the minority after 14 October...).
Electors believe to find their salvation at a party that preachs the discipline, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed himself from what the call and the dignity of our country has made.
The shame, Mr. Taws, is in this relief, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellic talk of Barrick Gold
In its office of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This employed, and followed an orwellic logic that the largest gold winning company of the world tried to open a consequence of six million against three authors and a small middleless home to open a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and independent, they shall not judge the truth, especially not in the case of claims of deliverance, but in the law.
As it is expected, this fundamental subdivision was completely disrupted by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate to move everyone in the ruin that is waiting for representing one of their opposite opinions.
As the process comes out, the authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to educate significant sums to prepare their defence and fight with very inequality weapons against an army of advocates paying from the almost unfair cottons of gold mine.
The tactics in these inequalities are often to destroy the defendants in order to force a consensus scheme that causes the opposite to be murdered and also fears everyone waiting for the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they had to present their view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is walking and giving, debates in Canada are usually exploited by the exchange of ideas and not by knife.
It would therefore be genuine if the Gold Mine opened its books and acts and opened a real debate, by means of the magazines, media, publications and the financing of independent tests that could have brought the light into this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public opinion and removes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand move.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, but did he fail the opinions of this public?
Apparently this word includes in the world of the Vice-President only the greatly paid advocates, not the community of all Canadians; a very fine view of the term.
In a democracy, the delegates themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, is especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the goldmine.
This public is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many hold as nobel claims (in the cycle of the public debate) has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they ask to not use this term anymore...).
Despite the surreal talk of Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the finding of truth, which are fundamentally for every democracy society.
It denys fully the right to cite credential sources and discuss the facts and interpretation that constitute the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to investigate and discuss the subjects that do not like the right firms of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The Universal Environment, which we belong to, has been able to get debates and unbalances and resolve conflicts since a long time.
The unproportional complaint of Barrick Gold shows clearly that, in contrast to what she is going on, it does not like a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the University World, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that threaten such injustices.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicians are understanding
The Bush administration and the leading Congress Deputys, Republicans and Democrats, have finally come to an agreement on the largest economic salvation plan since the great depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has spent Wall Street for months, must be adopted by the two congress rooms.
The main contents are: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the employed public money, new provisions to deal with the number of residues in payment, as well as the right to monitor the holders payable to the leading employees of the supported companies.
The Financial Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Deputy Chamber of Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the news, after a second-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective', said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
'All happened to sing the real economy and the people of the Ananias before the course crisis on the Wall Street,' explained the democratic.
`This is the fundamental point: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the injury in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous,' said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations have been accelerated during the last two hours, because of fear of the effect that would have been renewed to the vote of investors.
The term that was agreed was the market expiration tomorrow.
The two presidential candidates, which had participated in the negotiations first, were more likely to be the best of the agreement, but not to disappoint their failure to say that they should be met in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain arrangements, especially those who would allow the owners to keep their owners and those who were concerned with the holders of the leading employees of the undertaking saved by the State.
`If the tax payers are asked to take exceptional measures due to the responsibility of certain persons, it is nothing to be able to please.
But these measures are necessary, he explained to the television sellers.
When he was asked on another sender if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican enemy John McCain answered: 'I would like to know the details, but I hope it.
`The guidelines I have read, show that this is one thing we all have to endure, and with which we can go forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan is designed with the money of tax payers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, which has been solved by the place of an immobile blaz, which has led to a breakdown of riskable hypotechnical credits (subprime) before it extended to further forms of investment (PCAAA), and has become a refrigeration of the financial force and in the area of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of republian lawyers was that laid the last week the first trial to agree.
Since the democrats have accepted that certain  giftige' assets of the companies in trouble are to be safe and not covered by the government, it is believed to escape the sackgase.
In order to distort the angles for all in the Congress, it is also available that if the Government should lose this programme within five years, it may be able to highlight new taxes in order to retain its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can be able to reach the additional 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of more 350 billion must be advanced in a renewable vote from the Congress.
In contrast, for his help, Washington receives shares of the supported companies that introduce him in the case of winning dividends and that can rebuild it when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of maintaining the rental procedures in relation to the apartments related to the immobility credits concerned by this plan, and also fixing the time limits for the refund and deficiencies paid to the leading employees of the undertaking concerned.
The developers of the plan would like to vote on it already today, and then the Senate at midweek.
Despite all its efforts, it is still not sure that its plan will receive green light.
In fact, there are further votes against this statement yesterday, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Ganz obviously doesn't understand us,' said the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of the Chamber, his electors.
`Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not those who are in it to ask the tax payers for the cash.
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress, called 'the Kaukus of the skeptics', represents the things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
'400 economic professionals, including three nobel prices, have written us to inform us: we ask the Congress not to be pressed, and to consider carefully what way is to be put on,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we again received the evidence that this is a global crisis in Europe.
In an emergency assembly, the three Benelux countries announced the part of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The vote of the Governments, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank, BNP Paris, had given that it would refuse to purchase their competition, which is in great difficulties since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis through the riskable immobility credits in the United States.
Fortis is employed by 85.000 persons and belongs to the twenty largest banks and the largest insurance.
'This is not a lost money, explained yesterday by the Dutch Financial Minister Woo Bos.
In order to compensate, we have a choice and influence on the bank.
This is exactly what the sparers and households appreciate, now that unsafe times are announced. '
On the other hand, the British Government, on the other hand of the channel, was just about to establish another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would take all the current loans at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from immobility credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander gave yesterday that it would buy the British Bank's accounts and customers.
Bradford and Bringley would have been the second bank that the British Government has to rule since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was a long time his tromp, no one would say his weakness.
Did the sight player with the charming beds free from the Nazistic Spiegel?
Yeah and no.
His enemy feelings, his sensitivity and a manifest talent have also kept him away from a power that brings the real fearful monster to the world.
But what a big long-term passenger!
On Friday of 83 years on the consequences of long cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of his golden Kinos.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he liked and for which he was a kind of rival on the linwand for a long time, more careful in a viewing game, safely also disruptive, but also a apostle of freedom and the spread of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From his roots, one of the rational faces of the Traan Tra's should be found.
Without excessive ego, extremely quality characteristics.
Because it reflected a whole country that was given in the self-made-man, in the battles that were hurt in the Pacific War, who studied the beginning of the 50th years of show art in Yale and then visited the Actor's actor in New York before he had success in the theater, in television and soon in the film.
In addition to this man who fought for civil rights, he was also the leader who became in 1979 at the 24-hour running of Man's second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a preliminary relationship with Joanne Woodward, along with the viewer Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, also, the unknown faces of this mysterious, retaining, engaging and faced with the glamour of the showbusiness supersensitive stars whose race will never be perfectly solved.
An amazing man, in the purest sense of the word.
The dead Paul Newmans placed the Kinoliebhaber in Taumel this week, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of reminders.
More than half a century of film arts in constant changes are progressed with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) revoked into memory, and the young man who rejected his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the heavy blachdach, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will be called a much shorter remembrance in the 1990s, which will be raised to his sensible Mr Bri ́, who is deteriorated in a high age of a wedding that did not comply with all its promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in history.
This criminal, furious, active and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of shit) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was re-inserted after his death and made the Newman in 1956 right.
This sympathic ganove in the surprising The Sting (The Clou), which was exhausted in 1973 with the Oskar for the best movie.
As a disappointed and racious Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was he.
He's still.
In the course of life, the epochs are united.
The youth knows him especially from the coal movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox Trage of a eishockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in the Hudsucker proxy of the brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as a pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle fell.
In contrast to several films who have returned quite early from the movie world, Newman should stay in the satellite for a long time, while Hollywood, his powers, his praises and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he evaluated his too powerful performances.
The meter was not always easily for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose role was so long to flee.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outside: Neurotics, Alcoholics, Fieslings, or disturbers, with which he reflected his degrees and reliefs.
As a ruler, Newman enth encountered the undeserved sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, had a fine woman's portrait full of Melancholia.
He who lost his son Scott by a overdose, in 1984, widespread his film Harry and Son, a work full of enemy feelings and triumph.
At the floor of honors that went over Newman ergoss yesterday, Robert Redford explained his dear friend and former weaponsmates (they were played together in the Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Greatness and life pleasure were essential characteristics of the devastated sight player.
In addition to his legendary kare, there is now a great defensor of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent Kinos, an enemy of Hollywood's deployment.
We have often seen him standing with the foot in scales full of vineyards, in sugars, kidneys or other foods, and this was too uncomfortable, although we still found it fun at first.
However, the winning from his ranges was broken into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of moving on Mythos, Newman was involved in the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these seeds: 'Forever and until the end, your father was unbelievingly thankful for his good stars.
It was a honour to be here."
And for us it was a honour to follow the life of a so intelligent and magnified player.
An example of citizens, in the worst and in the widest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations in the penalty process will begin against Janos' supplication and its complexity.
In particular, the complaints will be subject to the participation of organized crime, and a serious damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including false documents.
According to the State advocate, the resources used for their own purposes, while the benefits provided were often of older accounts.
State money and payments by self-administration - total HUF 65 million - will participate in the casses of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, partially in the cases of individuals.
As given by the investigators, the accounts were made in the case of the payment payments and the units would not have been complied with their obligations.
According to the complaint, a majority of the accounts should be dealt with.
The accounting blocks were covered on the market of Josephefváros, the signs were offered in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which firms the accounts should be issued was decided northwardly by the Plattensee, which was sent to the István Lados of Janos.
In the movement of this "recurrence tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested accounts on consumption to make accounts based on these proposals for the Youth and Sport Ministry, the Social and Work Ministry and Budapest self-administration.
These accounts should be manipulated mostly by István Lados and ○ Complications, András 日ri, and should have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the targets of Lados' "Reporting tour" was a beerlocal.
As a result of two accounts issued in 2003 and Co, the Gastronomy Exploitant should have assessed the ninety-country group of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesuelet.
But now the leader of the operation indicates that such a large group would not even have passed into the local.
Another account, published in Summer 2002 on the Jobb Jövièret Foundation, later as Együtt a Harmadik Evezedt, also showed a grave form and content error.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which is only over three rooms and cannot be able to buy more than a person at the same time, 130 guests should be stopped.
The fantasy of the counterfactors was apparently not limited as the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation, whose accounting records of the customers Jobb Jövért and Hoppá were not only to appear as accused.
As the business leader Gy\z\ Farkas informed the hvg.hu, he was immediately clear that it was a deal of documents when he was presented by the State official during a questioning document.
"Our company name and the tax number were misleading on the stamp."
And further: Except for forms of errors, the fact that the operation had to have a hundred persons to be covered after they had a total of 11 rooms that were impossible to offer so many people a place.
It has also been indicated on the account of the complaint, whereas the aurant has not been operated since longer.
The accounting officers also have been able to check that the Budapest travel office, taken by them in the visa, offers travels to the foreign country, and thus indicated Hungarian travels on the bar payment, which was also contrary to the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as has been conducted in the investigations, they have also indicated the additional taxes, even though travel services related to a country outside the EU are free of tax.
The amount of the additional tax was totally four of the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv’ert foundation, because the operation was calculated instead of 25 only 15% of MwSt, and also the employees were exhausted from machine accounts, but the oldest documents were manually.
Another error undergoing the "recommended persons" was that, in one case, they had indicated "Warn transport" as a performance provided, although this was not offered by the specialized company on investment consultation, the State advocate shared.
More forms of errors - wrong account format, wrong stempel - was to thank that the accounts issued to Együtt a Harmadik Evezredt Alapitvány, as well as in XXI. Šázadi culture Egyesület and Biztos Pont were able to be inherited as false accounts.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sport Lager Kunfehértó, whose business leaders would never have issued the accounts.
Another "error" is the fashioners undertaken by the HIB Kft. from Nyérregyháza: this company was at the time (2001) just in resolution when the group of Fiatal Városert Egyesület had to eat there - the mass manager suggested that the accounts had not been issued themselves.
Conscious
The other group of accounting officers is persons who were obviously aware that they had to make fine accounts.
On request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Yefjú Szocialisták, the foundation Esély Budapestert Alapitvány accounts for the Együtt and Harmadik Evezedert Foundation has issued a height of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the complaint, the business leader of Collab Kft was granted by one of the complaints, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the ficticial accounts.
The currently also existing biogate Kft in Liquidation will also have a share and co.: In 2003, the 1992 funded Jobb Jövért Alapitvány, as well as the United Atlasz Egyesület and pre-sufficiency Egyesület with older accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million, which are based on unleavened performances.
However, there was also a little payment traffic, since the accounts were decreased immediately after their exhibition, which, however, had been forgotten by the concerned in their documents.
The accounting group includes persons directly connected to the complaints.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian business leader of Delta Trió Kft., one sitting in Budapest, but there is not foundable train and vehicle trade form.
This company will have issued several accounts on the sale of EDV components in the period of October to December 2005 at the total value of HUF approximately 18 million.
According to research staff, the Cash Investment Kft in Liquidation has been working as buyers of these accounts since 14 September 2005 from Kiskunhalas.
The business manager of this company was a Romanian whose company documents should also be provided by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has made accounts on behalf of the 1992. To the United Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány and has cast their own contrast.
The Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. have been founded by Romanian wallers on Iván Kubatov's explicit desire.
However, there was no of these firms active, which was appealed to lack of contracts.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: on request of his compliance, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was mandated to prepare firm funding documents, he has, on behalf of the companies, issued accounts to the units associated with appeal, such as atlasz and Y-generation.
In total, Kubatov 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14,2 million on behalf of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade have been issued to the organizations.
The State advocacy concludes that Kubatov could have cast 10% of the sum of accounts and the additional tax.
Kubatov would even have misuse Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of more effective accounts - in this case the accounts were added to the requests of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Company Y-Generacy and Šövetség a Modern Magyaroršágért issued their applications to the useful organisation of the socialist party, Ta ́sic Mihály Alapitvány ("TMA").
Both have received 500,000 forints, but these amounts have benefited from the deadlines.
To interfere with this, they presented the TMA five fixed accounts of the Works Team Kft.
These accounts were also ensured in the review of the Office of Árd Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some of the complaints have now been calculated with a view to the procedure of falsehood, as they have already been reported before the State advocate.
It may be a sensation if the major accused Janos is dealing with a comprehensive guest.
His previous information was less detailed, and even though he had already told to report all the things in a number of times, his consciousness remains.
The question, therefore, remains open if this is interested in whether the socialists have concluded an agreement with him regarding the recovery of the majority of HUF 50 million damage and whether it is prepared to take the responsibility in contrast.
However, it is clearly possible that the adjudication is now playing the "speaked" after his search for mildness of prison and household arrest was struck on baptized ears.
In currency, other criminals, which have made much greater damage with economic delegates and who have not emphasized them, are on free foot, or at least under household arrest, have been denied by this opportunity.
The psychology of the survival - or why we are ready to pay more
In increases, the purchasers are attracted to expenditure and therefore to overestimate the bug offer.
Neurologists and economic researchers of the University of New York are now able to discover the neurological-economic bases of this and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to one of the "Science" magazines, people will not be broken in competition, such as an increase in eBay, and are therefore ready to pay even high prices.
The researchers have tried to find the neurological scheme of this "spel" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others shared in a player action - in both cases the active brain regions of the probands were examined through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants could win money, however, an increased A of the striat, a complex under the brain, in the losers of the auktions, in which the oversight of the adversary played a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "the same recompense" of the nerve system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase was declared by avoiding an overreaction of the streat.
In order to undermine their teams, the economys in the research group have later conducted investigations on the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the real value of the product and then made its units.
One of the other groups were also promised a recompense for the case that they are winners of the game.
The group received 15° before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
The difference between both groups was, therefore, only that the point of pointing on one on the winning, while the other was on loss.
As a evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "genetic loss" group were prepared to set up incidences as those in the control group or "victory" group.
"These results can be obtained from no former economic theory.
These have, namely, based on the behavior observed in an auction, only with the joy of winning or risk prevention.
The opposition between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the illustrating neurological procedure, so we have now prepared a statement," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is Ar to search?
Over the world, about half billion people suffer under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
However, only seven thousand people are treated, which often doesn't know that they are incriminated.
Hepatitis is the summary term for different viruses, infectious hepatic diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatic inflammation and yellow inflammation are often, but the divergence and diseases are different.
The hepatitis viruss are spread to two different types: in hepatitis A and E by the hepatitis (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the virus can be overeseen by blood and other body liquids (e.g. sperma, divorce secret or speech).
Travelers are recommended to vaccine against virus A and B, and against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show about two-three weeks after feeding the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by injury, weakness, bottle pain and breakfast.
After that, the yellow search arises on the skin and in the eyes, the chair will be light, the urin dark, and the healing can take up until two-three weeks.
Worldwide, approximately 1 million people every year in the hepatitis B, much more severe diseases such as hepatitis and hepatic cancer.
The main reason is that, according to damage, only every inhibitor is in medical disorder treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to hepatic and hepatic cancer.
Most inquireds don't even know about their illness, since the hepatic cells are too devastated - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
It is therefore unrequired that timely prevention, such as regular control studies, is necessary.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequently: those who have been subject to blood transfusion before 1991 depending on and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the illness is already evident in a routinematic laboratory investigation, it is advisable to visit the household in the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized timely, the disease is healthy, the virus can be exhausted, thus building the infection carcinoma and prevention of cancer.
On 30 September, hepatitis is the World Day, 2004 for the first time of patients in the world.
The objective of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of this chronic hepatic inflammation caused by virus, their exhibition and the importance of early knowledge.
Do the believers have less pain?
As the newest research results show that religious faith acts as a kind of "soul" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Oxford's artists have conducted an interesting experiment: it was examined how faith in God influenced the human creation of the humans, the British sheet "Telegraph".
In the course of a rare study, 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks, while they studied a picture of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers could disable the majority of the pain.
A brain scan technology could even prove that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for the pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, which also included philosophers and theologists from different divisions of the University.
During the trial, a functioning device was connected to the left hand, which was locked out of the electric shocks.
The participants were invited to converge themselves strongly on two paintings: to a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The scientists hoped that the view of the girl Mary would produce a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they chose the picture of Vincis because it was almost differed from the other painting and was felt reliefful.
The experts ever spent a half hour in a MRI scanner, and at that time they received 20 electric shocks in four steps, or religious, or other paintings.
The Catholics reported that they would have felt "in secure" in view of God's mother, as if they were "in fear" and had felt "paus and peace".
They reported more than 12% less pain than if they had work in their eyes.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also said to share in the trial, could also produce similar effects with other, strongly effective images, also in the Atheists, but it was only to find the appropriate photo.
"We have to find a picture that exhausts very positive experiences, such as a mother or a father," as the psychology.
Anglican Bischof Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," as Wright.
According to these excellent results, the question remains the effect of a Madonna-imageos or another comparable pattern on the regulation of the believers' pain.
Would the high-quality girl Mary have achieved better results?
You're what you're talking about
In the case of their birth stages, Google can say with flight and right: it is to find in the boxes of people as well as over their heads in heaven: she knows where people have delivered their vacation, to which doctors they go, and what they move.
And yet not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business leader.
In the direction of Skeptikers who are bound by Orwellske horror visions, he allows: These would just overview the main of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google was to collect more personal data about the users and thus draw closer to the original objective of the company, which it wants to "order all information of this world".
Schmidt explained that Google is still world changed work after years at the beginning of the information collection.
Questioned by the Quo status in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to ask questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What Job really matches me?", but software programs are not still able to know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are clear that the search terms would be registered by their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the user to save his own search history and later to return to it, so that the matches can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic, the "recommendations", with which the system recommends mixed products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, the users ask themselves what happens in the case of a data failure -- "When you look at what I do" -- some are concerned about the Google data monopol.
In most cases, however, it is more than the potential power represented by the company that excitingly affects fear, and less the school feeling or the most before punishing, seeking for freedom or seeking to resist the power, which affects in many Internet users.
However, it is evident that the search terms are saved not only, but also to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of Paradise for this was recently the action against Pédolia in Brazil, which was provided by Google of the Brazilian Government for information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the Implementation of the Pédolines.
For personal rights, however, the users who were concerned could still remember in May when Google and the Civil Rights Organization EFF faced the Court against the FBI: thus Google can not be forced in the future with no point of the Constitution to give the FBI information on a secret request.
( However, the Federal Government has affected the issue of 500,000 web addresses and 1.000 search terms from the law for youth protection for years ago, but it has been subject to the list of individual users, respectively their list of web and search terms for two months.)
Thus, Google's image remains restricted: Those who distort their personal data because they provide the loss of their intimity and intimity through the use of the Google services, support the company with the competition of the firms that represent themselves.
In the meantime, the "Geek-Culture", which is present in many countries, and agrees with comfortable computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneur" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is the Windows market leader, even if both fight the same goal.
A reason for this is that Google does not require its users to require Implementation codes in contrast to Microsoft, and provides his services free, so that a open, permanently updated source code and program package appears to be more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks views the problematic relationship with personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that is particularly understood in the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
"Web 2.0" is, in fact, nothing but cooperating, speaking, leave the users with regard to tracks and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains to be shown publicly.
A medium youth can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - by Facebook via Xanga, it can connect to other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can integrate all this into a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also carry out blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallies that are placed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of more examples of cases shows: When looking at the photos of the party last night, the friend will soon find out with whom her unbelieving friend has deceived, or the employer will be released because he simply makes too honest about the business management of air - one is sure: the term "private speech" has been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads a online life is what he praises from himself - in some cases you could formulate the fundamental idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to handle the Google monopol, can do it - like with Scroogle, a tool that allows Google search machines, however, it doesn't expect to leave tracks.
No few people, obviously, register not on Community pages so that they cannot be found, but also the online Google tools, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not connected to large server parks and thus do not generate the best possible profile by the user.
The public opinion is also expected until Google shows his true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the advertising agencies, and the more rapidly imported services provide not only Microsoft but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the difficult opposite: In this way, the concert guide has completely denied a protest of the employees after the taxes of the company's child garden were duplicated, the management also considered that the multi-time occupation of the employees was too costly. However, all of this must be too mild at the same time that Google went in 2006 before the Chinese government and was even agreed with a agreement, which would filter all regimen critical matches, or those who were murdered against the good happiness.
The internal rule of the concert is that no new service will be exercised before, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could re-enhance some more powerful: Which some think that Google's book and magazine scan or archive project assumes in the meantime that the company needs to interfere with the highest courtship, others are more difficult because of the "Health" system that allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - such as "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best oral manner, in which a person will be terrifyingly close to the data given by Google.
Two youths help the dual killer of ozd to remove tracks
In relation to the double murder of Ozd, the police now asked two youths who are in the deceit to have assisted to remove tracks, shared the speakers of the Police Commissioner Borsod on Tuesday.
The youths were constant, now they are accused of the aid.
According to MTI's information, two girls are defending themselves on free foot.
Aid is threatened with a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double killing of Ozd, a 23-year-old local seating man, was taken in investigation on Sunday.
The man is under a forced fact that he has killed several persons from money.
In the course of the investigations, the 23-year-old had been charged with a greater amount of money for a 53-year-old.
However, the contemporary would not comply with his debt, so he laid his believer on the midst of the midst of the past in Ozd, where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the man planned the fact of long hand - this also proves that he has committed the murder with a hidden weapons on the tatort.
In combination with experts, the police now examines the fact weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Börse places a purchaseboat for Prager Börse
EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, offered the Warschauer bourses for the 100% purchasing of the actor packages of the Prager Börse.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warschauer Börse, confirmed the boat which the Poland had put on despite the fact that they were earlier excluded from the Czech as possible owners of their boats.
The reason is that the Warschauer Börse belongs to the State.
99% of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, wants to express more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech Daily Journal "E15", the victims of Poland include the maximum purchase price ever offered for the Prager Börs.
As reported in the magazine, the Vienna Börse, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Börse and the German Börse offers.
Petr Koblic, the leader of the Prager Börse last week said that all interested people would have been the worst new owner, and he did not say that it could even lead to the closing of the Prager Börs in the future.
Market experts appreciate the value of the Prager Börs at 5-10 billion crones.
According to the agreements of the shareholders, 90% of the shares could be recovered.
The largest owner of the Prager Börse is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13,5 Pro.
Financial crisis in the view of newspapers
In its comments on the international financial crisis that continued to continue, some leading papers already spoke of "only 11 September".
The global financial disaster we have to thank the President of the Ananias, about "La Republic" - the President had not even been able to make his own party for the draft legislation back to a person who should bring some deterioration into the terrible situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-sever investor Warren Buffett called, it would be appropriate to talk about "only 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the sinbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the lack of political leader is due to the world economy now at the border of the breakdown.
The financial system is always threatening to break up more, and it will suffer the whole world.
Bush plan was not perfect, but now after voting in the Congress, it threatens that Washington has not prepared a political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, just at a time when one of the largest transformations of capitalism is located.
You can't leave the threat anymore, like the gender "day-indicator".
Although some states could also provide funding institutions for their sale packages and save the banks with the money of tax payers from the bankroot.
However, if there is a dominant effect and there are more banks, no other financial costs nor other immediate measures.
The EU Member States should run over their shadows for a long term and centralise the control of the monetary markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros were paid to weak monetary institutions, the Vienna 'Standard', so the newspaper continues to be more realistic that, according to the Americans, the tax payers had to take something deeper in their bags to get out of the crisis.
Until this time, the EU has not severely exposed to the crisis that now has become like a Tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "resident" should not be "wedding" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advised to keep in the case it would be reasonable to take the money of the taxaries to deal with an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacles from nature?
For example, those of the birds.
The CEATEC in Japan was presented a surprising project in which the Nissan injectors of hummels were inspired in the creation of new accidents of preventive systems.
In collaboration with the Tokioter University, Nissan built the biomimetical system of type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the properties of the birds, with the aim of submitting the development of a system that prevents every collision.
In the flight, each boat forms its own, ovale "private" area, which is very similar to our own "shootsheet", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bovine, which can see in each direction and in a angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in it.
To follow the function of the combined eye, researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance measurer.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree face field within 2 metres, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board, which immediately starts the collection avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds breaks, and the author boot will immediately change the course, similar to the movement of the bones, rotating the rivers around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to current systems, this manover finds pure instinct place.
"If it wasn't so, the authors could not respond quickly enough to eliminate the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authorobotter project.
The system must respond instinctly and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the inner and vulnerable part of the protective sheet - a shadow that is still in the case of accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bones when they evacuate other bones.
And this must run in a second break.
However, it can only be two-dimensional, in contrast to the birds, not up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, but only towards the rotability of the pipes.
Since the bones here are unfinishedly open many opportunities to evacuate other bodies, the researchers could only use the movement of the authorobotter, regardless of the acceleration and breast-feeding.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries which are easier and energy efficiency centers, and therefore have a longer lifetime than the original lithium ione batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinct, intellectual reaction, and less on the processing of data, and yet less on the ability to save them.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It must not save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous manover, so it takes only a handful KB Me ́ in charge.
No gigabyte and megabyte hard memories are required.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance, which, after Nissan's assessment, will be seriously in production within the next years.
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation, knowing that the car driver is linked to obstacles and thus leading it to the objective.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the 700-mrd-dollar severe salvation packages, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at achieving the bad credits of the banks.
In the first trial, the aid of the money will be issued.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after Middle East Coast after the Middle East Coast, the Congress Deputys, after several-day debates, made a consensus on the 700-mi-larden dollar, reported Ree·s.
"We have achieved essential progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democracy president in the House of Deputy Ladies, and said that the agreement should be brought to paper only.
The achieved committee on the salvation package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Financial Minister Henry Paulson said the result: the programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but it will be more to do, as Pelosi said, not to save the Wall Street but to save the economy's ruder.
The written replacement of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so, Washington Time Sunday 8 hours (medium time Monday 2 hours tomorrow), but he did not solve a height flight on the beaches.
On Monday, the House of Deputy votes first on the draft legislation to stabilize the economy in 2008, then the senate is in line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved by the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to screw our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme declines from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, whereby the 700 billion should be issued once for the acquisition, with credits.
In a first tranch, the half of the 700-mi-mi-Minth amount will be issued, where 250 billion are available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the case on Monday. This sum will be used for the acquisition of credit billion, bad value papers, and the President will decide over the remaining 100 billion USD.
The programme shall be reviewed by a own Commission who also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other aid of 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the meaning of the Law, the Financial Ministry may also apply a combinated tactic: it can at the same time purchase bad credits, hypoteques, and buy value papers charged with hypoteques, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Minister reported, the acquisition can be carried out both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the inquiry resources, and the enterprises pay the respective taxes to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The Law defines the necessary means so that up to 700 billion billion can be provided as a immediate assistance for the financial system of the Ananias, if it is for the large acquisition of bad resources, their insurance, or for the avoidance of a system risk, which is eliminated by the collapsing of a larger monetary institution.
We set the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the Law, soon as it was signed, as Paulson.
However, the chiefs of the banks who are in difficulties and are now assigned to State assistance can be considered to be reduced by the Government's deficiencies called "Golden Handshake" in the oversee-sound.
A reduction of the containers will only be given in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each other.
The reduction is essentially that if the Ministry reaches an auction, the "Gold Handshake" will be charged unless the issued bank head will be cut into the pension.
In the case of a direct acquisition of false credits, the Government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers are not transferred.
It also includes that existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions are only related to new agreements so that more people will participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the Ananian history that shortcomings are regulated by Managers by law, the Democracy Barney Frank, president of the Financial Committee, commented on the action.
The State wins share rights to the shared banks, so the risk of tax payers is decreased, as they can also share, as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank will be better.
The draft legislation provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how the tax payers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides that expressed their doubts on the plan.
This is not what the citizens of the Ananias expect from us, the plan will never have the money of tax payers, as the Californian Republic of Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Captur said that the measures were offered by the same persons who are also responsible for the collapses of Wall Street.

No vision anymore in the United States since 2009?
Kinga Gönč sees the possibilities that the Hungarian-Hungary Visum Agreement will enter into force around the 12th, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Your view is "depends only now on whether the electronic immigration control system is implemented in overseas in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no travel permit in the new system, but the tourists had to register themselves before.
The leader of the Hungarian diplomacy leads negotiations today in Washington.
It comes to the Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will submit to the "Medium Service Cruz with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also speaks with the foreign policy advisers of Democracy Barack Obama and the Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain save package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the Great Partys, have given their support for the 700 billion, but there are more demands to return to the Minister for Finance on Sunday.
The Congress and the Government's representatives announced tomorrow after daily Marathon reports on Sunday morning that they had come to an agreement on the Bank Saving Package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the recovery of the frozen credit, were to the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better than the enemy to lead the country from the economic crisis.
After the latest inquiry, Obama could continue to develop its preference thanks to the economic theme, while McCain's High, which protected him the representation of the vice-Presidency candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has been mixed.
In a choice fight in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will accept the law of 700 billion.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passports of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We have to act now, and even responsible... - your jobs, your rests, your whole industry, and the stability of the whole economy will be threatened," he said before 35,000 viewers.
He didn't disappoint McCain's economic visions as "obsolete".
In an interview given to the ABC, McCain explained: "These are all we'll have hard to kick... but the non-support is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan would also prescribe the establishment of a control commission for the Minister for Finance and the restriction of the deficiencies for the top manager - something that he had been on.
The CBS said Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in negotiations, but Obama was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, shared that the lawyer's house will proudly vote on the draft law already on Monday.
Pressview of the German Ra
The right store is intake, only the electors have become self-conscious in the store - so "The Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-swarm coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic reduction of the CSU in the article "Bayer's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renommated politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the grievous Beckstein-Huber-Duo took his owners.
The Christian socials have renewed Bayern over a year - now the modern citizens are just turning away from them.
The Epoch Broke is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
It's not surprising that the disappointment of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday it's been done something, but it's already been exactly ago a few years ago: the undesirable hegemonia of a State party.
For age ago, 1998, the CSU lands at 47,7 Pro and falls first from the fifty-pro-marks.
This repeated three years ago at the date-by-day elections of 2005, so still in the many quoted staiber era.
The modernization of the CSU in the Federal Country has destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists have prognosed this for 40 years ago, but they have been very appreciated at the time, but without effect, the slaughterisation, the educational results, the accession of East and North Germans to the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain loyal to the CSU electors.
Modernization is always with optional increase, and this has political consequences.
The right layer is intake - only the electors in the store have become more critical and self-williger.
In the last weeks, the classic citizen groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free profession, the professional citizenship and the electors with Abitur, such as high school conclusion.
Here the support of the CSU was reduced to less than 40 Pro.
The press (depresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Journal reports in its "Who with whom? Participants who are in coalition issues" articles on the chaotic internal situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OECD.
The EVP is prohibiting the mixture of SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for talks while the green will not yet be established in relation to coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything turns around coalition; in the debates in public-local television, the participants were not looking at their cards.
SPÖ-Cheef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the EPP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation of both parties is very well possible - in some countries and in social partnership, this is already the case.
The question is whether he could present a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, who is currently Vicecanzler, has opened Faymann.
As he said, the electors would have chosen the shoes-Molter curse.
The repeat of this direction is not in question.
Instead, Molter responded carefully to red boats.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he thought, when Faymann tries to unite himself in the internal statement of the OECD.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in coalition, is currently fully open, and these questions should be discussed inside the OECD.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider opened in all directions.
"To prevent red-swarm, we are ready to take government responsibility," said Haider.
Yaróka: The Devil Circle of Poverty and Segregation must be interrupted
Today, in Paris, the European Gipfel has started to be equal to the opportunity set out today by the EU presidential country of France.
In its speech addressed to the Plenum, Livia Jaróka, Deputy Fidesz of the European People's Party, especially the Education Segregation, was one of the most serious legal damage that occurred to the children of Rome, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their exercise.
The high-term conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Chance Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, social partners, as well as the most significant legal protection and civil organisations in the field of equality of opportunities.
As reported by the Press office of the EP members of Fidesz, Jaróka noted that, in addition to discrimination in the search of jobs, the Roma would be deteriorated from work by low levels of education.
"The major majority of Roma's youths have no medium-school education, and thanks to a bad basic education, only a small part of them can get a high-school conclusion."
In addition, Jaróka stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which is a key role in the creation of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the Members, it is important that these associations will be a widely broad circle - so Rome and non-Rome -.
Since a Roma student begins the school, the more his chances to become a productive member of the work; and by income tax and tax, they contribute to national debts.
"If citizens of the Union, the right to high-qualitative education must be guaranteed to Rome - the bad and secure education must be established" - Livia Jaróka.
As the Member stated, a common, objective and negotiated process of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the degregation process in the educational sector, which is necessary for the proper compliance with existing and scheduled anti-discrimination directives.
"We must interrupt the devil circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roman children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as perfect citizens," Jaróka requested.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the Gipfel has been organized annually with the aim of establishing a unique forum for the implementation of the objectives of equality and freedom of discrimination at a better, but also national level, in the meaning of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: G per time
The end of October is decided on the shick Hall of Duos Huber-Beckstein
Despite the election debuilding, no heads are still rolled at the top of the Bayer CSU, the staff debates were held.
Partchefe Erwin Huber and Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this Guide is.
In the last week of October, on the extraordinary day of the party, it is decided on the shick of the dance after the catastrophe of 17 pro voice loss.
The very scholar duo, however, has already seen that it doesn't want to cross their seats.
In this way, they want to approve the enraged group and the partial base, which requested a day after the "Bayer Tsunami" face of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago - granted under the leading of the Kara's highpoint of Edmund Stoiber - the Christian social Union reached 60.7%. However, now, one year after the puzzle against stoiber, they could only secure 43.4% of the votes.
The CSU has been "Alleinregister" in Bayern for 46 years, which has been produced by 18 pro of the German BIP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in which the Hungarian economy also is important for the Southern Federal Country, they will have to rule in a coalition future.
As the first character of the parties' restructuring, the potential follower Hubers, Vice-President and Minister of Federal Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be incorporated into the Review Team with the Liberal FDP, regardless of the legal "Free Electors" vocational discussion on a possible coalition of Münchner.
One of the ironies of the shicksals is similar to that with the list "Free Choices" of the Gabriele Pauli is entered into the legislation, whose anti-stoiber appears first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to then reserve the goal streamless.
The CSU leader now can handle all its powers on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who moved the feet from the background, will have an active role. The former President and CSU president called "the last day of his political carrier" on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments in direction of the CDU - its view would have deserved much more support from the Sister Party.
Other CSU policies interpreted the download as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also has reached a lot at national level in 2005, is not replaced with a common force act, the labels may not be re-concelered after the date-willing elections in September 2009.
Markel, who has not made the deception of Fiasko, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU will not affect the big coalition in Berlin.
However, what is related, the vulnerable CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
With 18.6 Pro, the SPD has reached the best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the walls on Sunday, no member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament has occurred.
Russian observers believe that this is the well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD, however, assumes lacklessness in the statement of votes.
The OECD, sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the waves.
Although the legislation of the 10-million inhabitants has been exposed for years without opposition, however, the counterparty collected in the name of "United Democratic Powers" (ODS) has severely hoped that Lukechenko, who, in the case of unclean elections, renewed his mandate of presidency for the fourth time, would be allowed by some members of the opposition in Parliament.
That is why the ODS even took distance from the previously planned boycotts.
The increased prices in the import of gas from Russia will be more economically dependent on Ukraine, and for the reduction of price increases, the country has also taken credits to the exhibition of the Beltransfer gas, the owner of the gaspipeline, which is accepted to the Russians, and, in the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, since the Luxembourgenko and other high-range higher ones have been prohibited by the EU as antidemocracy policy system.
For a transitional rest, the OECD electoral assessment report, which highlighted the positive movements, rather than the deficiencies - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates by the electors -, provided for a transitional delay.
However, the OECD School report already criticized the campaign on Monday - then the oppositional should not occur in the press - and, in particular, the fact that the opposition would not be present in the statement of the votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition was able to recognize a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were approximately placed on free foot, and Minsk is even to smaller contrast with Moscow by continuing to recognize the independence of the separate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abcasia, whereas Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state, which has been considered independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backward, but the most important is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our sheet.
According to the 2006 Presidential election candidate of opposition, a continuation is desired, despite "the powerfuls have obtained to leave only one oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but trys to clear the need for economic reform to the electors.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the oppositional journals must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way during the destruction of stones, but I see that even more people are undergoing the change, even the elderly," Milinkewish said in the example that even the most covered ship of pensionists with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only deserve is the production of social security.
"Through the debt of the country and the increase of the trade deity, it is only a question of the time until the "social security" that is urged to break on the silence of a peacehouse," so Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to opposition policies, Russian observers have deployed the elections as democracy.
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the Community Mission of independent States, explained by the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the facts, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a evidence of the rocks of the white-russian electors.
Brunetta: "From now, it's tomorrow before the work."
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrance and outcome of the officers.
Since today, the measure will enter into force against those sleumees who are first-speaking and then going to drink coffee during the worktime.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Triving doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a strict presentation rates and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta stresses again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the establishment in all constructions of the Presidency of the Council.
Masi refers to this: "The choice of the roundable doors is also of great symbolic value."
From the sides of the officers there was no opposition, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all who had been cooperated from all sides."
Everything in all, therefore, there is no breakfast more during the worktime; closes with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas consults with a laugh: "A good cappu ́no acts wonders at 7 hours."
Monetary meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scoola Superiore della Public Administration)
of Rome states that "the disabilities of officers have been reduced to 50% within three months, which means 60,000 persons per year are more present in the work."
It is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy.
"the loan dynamics - so the Minister - have been doubled in the last 8-10 years as large as the area and far above the rate of inflation."
Meanwhile, thousands of officers have joined themselves to address the Brunetta decree under the Codacons supported vocation.
"When the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of less absencies in the work - the consumer center - which is uninterrupted by the people of the 'active fools'.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officers of the public service have joined themselves to declare the decree's contrary standards to war."
In the case of the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, the planned extension of the obligation of the employee's household, which can be carried out for control visits and further aspects of the renewal of the Minister.
Napolitano: "Promotion against unemployment accidents is decisive"
Each day, 2500 work accidents occurred in Italy, three persons died and 27 remain invalid.
For the year 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto na_ contragli infortuni sul work) were reported that the death accidents were about 1200.
These figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which almost doubles so many deaths as the murder results.
Today, the Anmil (Association Na _BAR_ Mutilati e invalidi del Lavoro) in all Italy's provinces will be the 58th national day for the victims of unemployment accidents in order to draw attention to this dramatic situation of social institutions and media.
"The worrying, spread by Anmil, and the tragical news of these days, as the question of the Prevention on the Workspace is decisive.", visited by the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Association na_ mutilati ed invalidi del work) Pietro Mercande_.
The Governing Boss expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention of workplaces, protection of vulnerable workers, assistance for victims' families and sensitivization of public opinion".
"An emphasised "Basta" has risen up to it; clearly, in tragedies that, in their size order, blow some wire in the media and share the public. However, the daily reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamic."
Napolitano does not emphasize that "in any case there is a resource problem: it must be decided to be invested in education and information."
It is particularly important to adopt the numerous initiatives for a more direct consciousness in school frameworks from young people who are coming to the work world.
It is our obligation to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to avoid social seriousness. It is necessary to enable and improve a legal standard.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini, on the other hand, stressed: "How the phenomenon of the work-related deaths is a third social need, which enables all of us to enable the conscience and forces all institutions to work on certain rules that aim to end the problem."
"The data of work accidents seem to be a easily improved, but this does not exclude that the number of job-related deaths is too high," states the President of Anmil, Pietro Mercanda.
"We don't want that this "essential tendency" means less attention. This is exactly the cause of the tragedy at the end."
"When you believe that you are too few to face the phenomenon of accidents, you can fight by various actions.
Increasing controls and inspections are as necessary – so Mercanda; but also strengthening measures for the creation of workers already in school.”
"A further effort is needed - so he adds - as regards communication and sensibleness of public opinion.
But in particular, a greater responsibility feeling of the employees' sides of a phenomenon which represents a social emergency is asked."
Mercanda also came to speak "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the accidents of the job" and claimed the "reduction of the social system which we have been fighting in the last years".
"The objective is, therefore, to return a guarantee to the employer insurance so that the salle of the victim of an accident of work is not dependent on voluntary or accidentally decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under accusation: ____________________________________________________________________________________________
A sound music over a longer time with trackable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent audience damage.
This reports the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of Csrseri (the Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) in a report in Brussels.
"From the report – that is in a note – is clear that 5-10% of those who hear sound music with tractable music devices for at least five years a week longer than one hour a day risk the permanent loss of their audience."
"I worry that a lot of young people, usually driving musical devices and phones, will be a high volume of sounds, without knowing unreduction," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – which is from the Eu – is a clear risk that requires rapid action.
What really is, it is to make consumers aware and to make these information about the same time.
In view of these scientific knowledge, we need to review the existing control systems again, so that they are fully effective and keep steps with the new technology."
Brussel had ordered the independent scientific committee in view of the spread use of tragic musical devices among youths.
"The EU's communication concludes that the Commission is too concerned and that the Commission will now examine the necessary measures for children and youths to be better able to be able to get out of travelable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a standard that limits the level of layer of tragic musical devices to 100 dB. The care of the damage that could come from a too large sound charge.
These damage can be very limited in solutions such as reduction of the volume and the length of the sound setting.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of You points out that if users of tractable music devices only listen to the week (la日 as 89 decibel) music so that the legal limits are already overwhelmed, which apply to the maximum sound speech at the workplace.
Those who cross the music are risking the total loss of hearing within five years.
So this is about 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number is between 2.5 and 10 million people in which you can be estimated.
Rome, Germany gives the start-up to the "Commission for the Future of the Major City"
We start today, on March, it will be done in June.
This is the end set out by the Chapter for the works of the "Commission for the Future of the Major City of Rome".
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city and the Community will evaluate the analysis and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Chapter and Master Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in her," comments Alemanno. "He will present proposals for a development plan for Rome with its political responsibility for the cities and the community.
There is no new distribution of competences, but only the will to have a place where a large project for Rome can be developed.
On March, their task will be completed and the Commission will resume it, since such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June, this is what the Master reports - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work made by the Commission."
Who asks the Commission's competence, since its view of commitment is missing, Alemanno replies: "All depends on the work that the Commission will carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If she, as in France the Attali Commission, provides qualitative results – and this will certainly be in Rome the case – then her contribution will be fundamental.
Too often it is too busy with the daily problems and disasters that occur from time to time.
However, we want to have a longer period to work with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The top of citizens of Rome is very valuable to identify the following: "This Commission is not an unusual establishment or a wrack: she is absolutely free, she will not cost the Roman citizens and will bring us to think, and she will occupy the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "the strategic plan which is not hermetical or statistical to enable our city a quality speech - which she really needs - and thus a common step in the future."
A future, as the top citizen of Rome, which "not only will be limited to the current communal borders but will continue to look forward", not only as regards the role of Rome as the Metropole and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A man of ananian, which is much to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimalized the United States' economy and was deployed in relations with the enemies of Islam (and this is still a man of today)."
The attacks against Obama will always be more heavy, right now where the walls are near.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frequent: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racism attacks and they do not answer the question of the electors: will he be a good president? And then there are questions; everyone says that Obama will be won with a great prejudice.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election cabin, we will well know who the real patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the United States, which has been hidden too late.
"Tell what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crystals, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll be out of America.
Something you never heard before -- just now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapons for the democracy are George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What errors did Bush face during his office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a trick in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to packaging.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for most of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his position is in front of a great task.
United States. The financial breakdown also leaves his tracks to journalists: In the magazines you can see the shortages. And many accuses the Internet, the "Killer" of the print press.
Five hundred age journalists were questioned by the Research Center on their situation and their mental control.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they explained that the information about competences is not really concerned about the general credibility.
You don't feel alone as before.
The problem for the journalists is the money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a economic model that has been decreased for these journalists.
In addition, the big problems come through the reductions in the newsroom, so the room where the editors work to compile the journal.
It is a problem that must be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent the traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, does not mean that the traditional journalism, as it is.
A clear, but complicated physicist fulfils today the journalist.
Six journalists and executive seniors of the press are the opinion that the journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed against Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine how the web goes.
The most important groups are in the Internet, which is viewed by many as the "killer" of the print press.
The "economic pressure", which the journalists find, is to reach up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology, in the hope " they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rise is today in the journalism of the newsroom's chief doctors and reporters who work for them.
56% of the national headquarters are sure that their reporters share their values with them while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think that it has to do with the "security in the work".
The operating leaders who have the ability to lose their work within three years shall be 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "redactors", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current subject in the United States.
Only 13% of the journalists work under the Treaty.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of magazines, magazines, radio and television senders and internet operators, the employees offer such a question as they say, and thus it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The Chefredactors receive very often very high loans, however, the editor can receive only 10000 euros per month, with a view to rental and insurance money.
As regards the holiday, the thing is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the time to get sâ after a certain number of 15 years of vacation.
But the journalists of the Ananian will, as they give themselves, often "mally" during the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second sentence of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the Immobiliary Manufacturer, which requested to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankrots in the context of the investigation on the contravention in the case of the receipt of Unipol Bnl..
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the home arrest was converted into a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had requested to allow the immobile carrier to be transferred from the province to a apartment in the capital city.
According to the Court, such allocations (which the State appealed) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and reach his accusing evidence material.
The Elite is in
The phenomenon had appeared a few days ago when the Deputy Chamber against the 700 billion dollar spare package of the White House was: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than to save the economy.
This visits the strict degree of New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the Republican Party, which is more splitting in its old and moderate East Coast Sea, always benefiting the state institutions and business and those neoconservatives who are "the in Washington" and the financial world, and also wins in the south and center of the States Electors.
This part of the party thanks to its increase in the vote that I had learned above.
This is also a small part of the large changes that announce the current economic landscape or already represents: not only in the United States, even in the west and may be affected by these.
In both countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long threatened events, which finally adopt and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomenon is the new discovery, the unhearted renaissance of the State in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decrease of banking and financial institutions, which are closely linked to the foreignership and, at the same time, to manage a number of funds residing in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments: how to behave with the families concerned, which also represents a huge choice mass.
Thus, the crisis appears economically global, but politically, however, it is almost clean national.
The political internationalism seems to be aware of itself and has lost its right of speaking: the lighting evidence has been given by the EU, which does not find a common way due to its double division in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone now considers the intervention of its own country; salvation plans, new rules, etc. the distribution of aid fund: since the crisis has become more serious, only the United States have saved themselves in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also use this legislation: therefore two non-transferable conditions, in certain circumstances, whereas no international organisation or market can be replaced in the same way.
The new emphasis, which is placed on the State-national element, is in the rest perfectly in accordance with the most important importance of the latest sector in the economy, which is linked to the most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxer way is just now, when we were so convinced that we were so long to enter into a connected global kingdom, in a kingdom of always different technology, the immateriel that we must find once how our future will always depend on the essential material things: water, greenhouse and oil.
Although they can be transported from one place to the other world, they are still connected to an extremely written part of the earth — a territory.
That is why the person who is available over such a territory is in favour of another person who is in a free area of oil or in a free zone of oil.
I am now coming to the second news, but it is a short delay.
Whoever is the territory, who is the government, who says it, it also says Leadership.
In this regard, the financial crisis seems to create two convergence phenomenon.
On the one hand, there is the need for leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wall of exhaustion over the existing leaders, i.e. those of the economy that have been exhausted as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and in a certain sense more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, a loss of confidence, an image of insufficiency, a feeling of remote, which is all towards a whole class of west managers.
It seems that the conviction under large parts of the population is to hinder the way that it is not only the facts of the social elite, but already their idea world, their way of life, their culture in the most significant sense of the word, whose content is more and more stranger and overcome.
The request for Leadership is therefore undergroundly disturbed but strong movement of the creation of the leading class and of the original political establishments. This is demonstrated in the unpredicted "revolts" of the electors and in the unexpected conversion of the collective tree status of the last time: starting with the creation of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the combination of the Labor party in the United Kingdom, to the rebellion of the members of Ananian against Bush (and may also play a role in the victory of the rights in Italy here).
The impression that the old elite, its parties, their programmes, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more understanding problems, and thus less representative value of what happens today in the underlying social shifts of the West and is still strengthened by the financial crisis and is done to the overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be hard to talk about a "rebellion of masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is certainly not.
The supercler that allows to rise on walls
The powers of the severity grateful to get to a weapon and to able walls to hang up like Superman.
This is the subject of four-annual research, which seems to be almost attached to the objective.
With a surface of only 2.5 qcm cleber, the researchers have been able to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an ananotic magazine, has made the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material discovered by the research team is a further development of the pregnancy already used, which is a special carbon structure called carbon-nanorch.
"The Prince of the Kleber can be presented as a series of Spaghetti's stapels assigned to the wing," Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The experts have made themselves inspired by the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic forces that give the animal a perfect stand.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sleep paper have shown that the new cler is often stronger than the maintenance of the feet of the reptils and at the same time "leaves unproblematic from the wall", so Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Engineering Sciences of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transfusional cloud," adds Liming Dai.
Something like Spiderman's incoming to walls? Maybe, but the researchers think more about a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor's are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other application areas may fall in the area of the road.
For the moment, the superhelders have to wait.
Other species of research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is designed to be a new species of clergy.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian companions present a cloud from microfashers who cleans themselves like hair by moving on a surface themselves from the dust and keep a perfect detention.
Medicinal products: Never take with fertility
Preview of grapefruit, orange and apple salt.
These woods, which are consumed in the summer due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin riches, may result in serious health damage when they are taken together with certain vitalizing medicines, since they can affect the adoption of this body in extreme way.
David Bailey, professor of the Western Ontario in London, repeatedly shows the risk of packaging and fresh fruits in connection with medical adoption. In the framework of 236. meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelity, he again struck warning: There is a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit to reduce the capability of certain vital medicines so that these are practically eliminated and so the health of the patients is decreased.
Grapefruit saft was already deceived to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiastas, heart circulation medicines, anxiolytic and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL IN GEFAHR – The same agent of the medicine has been warned two years ago by doctors and patients before the mixture of this mixture, and stresses to take care of what is drinking in relation to medicines such as diazepan or metadon.
IT NOT THIS GRAPEFRUIT – Experts also contain oral orancing and appeal suit substances that the medicines can hide.
The list of active substances produced by the feedingstuffs is long.
Therefore, the call by Michele Carruba, director of the University Statale di Milano: "These results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international producers who are so willing to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package packages and, if there are not yet clearities to have no shit to ask an apotheker or Ar," the expert of the Ansa Agency states.
The economic nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for the analysis of trade patterns and the promotion of economic A.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and external policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the day of Enron's breakdown, Krugman said in a leadership of New York Times that this second event was more determined for the history of the United States than the attentate.
A predict that has not been a little polymetic response and has been held to the economy yet years later, but today has been completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandales in the framework of the Enron or Worldcom meetings have been disappeared from the public field," Krugman explained end 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is especially against the ex-agressive liberalism of the Bush Government".
Open Office, it appears the version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software is won as free replacement for Microsofts Office a number of users, both home and in the Office, both among freedommaking and public administration.
After a year of intense work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN microsystems, the new Open Office presents now with some news to the public: in addition to a over- and now-scartanic starting menu, one of the guaranteed compatibility with Apples Operation System Mac OS x is now reached, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format, so the latest ISO version, given.
Eight contrasts were also available to the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, including those who allow to decrease the size of PowerPoint presents, e.g. easier sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files in graphical editing modules and to keep the original appearance of the page.
This is how "hybride" PDF files can be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format about the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be handled more hands by different users, avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be assigned a fraction to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be published in the next weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version that is on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to home or to the office.
If the freedom of expenses may be an incentive to spread the program into the households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice of the big story could succeed: s^ have already been transferred to OpenOffice various institutions of public administration and schools.
In fact, it does not even miss a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even open business perspectives.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program aimed at excel deterioration; Impress, to create presents as well as with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of more access; and later Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can also easily exceed 3 million and 600 thousands of now reached.
In addition to coal positive tests and thus the fourth case
It opens a new case of my frame of the past tour de France: it is the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of Gerolsteiner team, who is the third classer and winner of the tricot of the best cletter.
The message published the Daily Journal L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal of Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested at Cera, the Epo of the Generation. This has already occurred in the Italian Riccardo Ricco and ↓o Piepoli and in the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis from the blood tests of Kohls belongs to those who have been activated in the last weeks by the Labors Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If the anti-tests are now the positive results of Cera, the Austrian will lose its place and will be excluded from the runs for two years.
The leader of the French Antido committee Pierre Bordry visited the positive epotest, and reported as the Press also the Austrian competences.
The 26-year-old Austrian, behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, went to the podium and also encouraged the tricot of the best clatter for himself.
COVER SUBJECT: THE NEW YORK TIMES AWAKE: ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the only country of the immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants" which are only being taken with opposition.
Does this from Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article, which is dedicated to the whole theme of racism in Italy, and from the case of the young man, from Burkina Faso fit Abdul William Guibre, who was killed a month ago in Mayland after he had stolen a packaging Kekse.
The case refers to what the Times are "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and employment" are, however, "the highest degree of anti-immigrational sensations and the greatest support of the North Lega".
As an activation of the growing spending between Italians and immigrants, the times are based on further episodes of intolerance from Miland, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
In addition, the new legislation against immigration and the rapider exhibition of illegal immigrants, introduced by the Lega, is referred to as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also supports the father and the state president: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the father at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the church and the State to combat the racism."
Student Tuns Offers of up to 900-euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for continuing doesn't know any crisis.
According to the last study of Sunia, the municipality, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Mailand, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious moves. In these cities, all of the students lose their right to study, since their families are not able to submit them to this height" – so the responsible of Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the large request leads to a deformation of the market that also harms the other residents.
Furthermore, the majority of the sales offers include a series of violations: free contracts, missing registers, without grant price limits, unleavened undertakings.
For the Sunia, the need for exceptional measures leading to lower taxation prices.
For more accurate consideration of the investigation, there is evidence that in Miland a quarter of Brianza is required about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Uine and Fiera, or at least 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florenz, a average sleepplace costs 350/400 euros, a 700 room.
In Bologna, where students can walk around the University, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the University are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping room in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the midsts in the quarters around the other Universities of Rome: 550 euros in Osts and Cinecittà.
Only those in the outside area can save money: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Neapel, 300-450 euros are needed for a sleeping room, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most deepest quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed space costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the state economies.
In cities where the phenomenon of missing of extra students, such as Perugia, is more frequent, there is even another anomalie: a middle that lies over the average of 25-30% is required by foreign students.
Bye-bye to the old kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinesale
The historical kinos are closed due to the beneficial multiplexkinos.
"A city without kinosale is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large city centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of elimination of the Kinos, which began with the birth of the big multi-sale complexs in the periphery, long-term means the death of the unsalkino in the center. A process that appears not only inevitable and unrevocable, but also the movement of a cultural crime.
The most historical places are recorded, "is to lose a friend with which you have returned a part of a street full of emotions," as the leader of the film "Novo Cinema Paradiso", who introduced him 20 years ago the Oskar and the great price of Cannes. It is the story of a prestadtkinos and his nostalgies, which consists of it, to live in a forever lost kinowelt.
The numbers that the Anec, the Central Conference, provides a clear language: In the past five years, the unfortunate quantity of 316 traditional Chinese has to be closed; these decades paid mostly the Chinese in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Malaysia, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions belong to Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost kinos, followed by Toscana with 44 and Lombardei with 41.
This shows that the main debtors are the multiplexkinos, because there are exactly these three regions in which the largest number of these modern Kinos has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardei has listed, 81 are both in Toscana and in Emily Romania.
"The business has developed in a irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "although it is useful to create new structures, but in the first place, the maintenance of the already existing, because a hall in the city is closed, not all his staff seconds are ready to find a multiplexkino in the periferia instead of the old.
And there is still a lack of food for the fund of the trade union: the charge of the State's debt is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame of ethical moral position that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year of needs."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to sing them through an agreement between the community and the Anec, because of the ancient ancient Chinese sales, is the first agreement in Italy, which aims to shalt and understood the traditional Kinos, which is both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures predicted are also tax advantages for the kino operators and the benefits of the public in relation to navigation: it will be permitted to carry into the limited areas of the centre and to park more favourable parking taxes.
"It's a pleasant initiative," so Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will be joined to our example and develop new concepts.
But, of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to fix something against the superpower of the multiplex sales, because the public of today is more responsible.
The defense of the traditional Kinos was always a important subject for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the exhaustive point that made me the "New cinema Paradiso" although I had played with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I have passed on Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Na′, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to do not need to see the powder covered places.
The connections between the Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the citizen of Gioia Tauro
"The citizen of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group Piroma.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia members of Kalabrien against the citizen Master Giorgio Dal Torrione and his representative Rosario Schivone of the community Gioia Tauro, arrested tomorrow for mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piroma, the elderly mediator between the public and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken into hands: the lawyer who had the same name as the boss of the Boss had already been condemned for the crimes in Mafia, at that time to a 10 million euro compensation sum.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard failure," says the lawyers, "the two local administrations have ordered to pay for advocate Piroma's money for advisory activities."
"Somit it was made possible to the Mafia Group – so the judge – to enter the road official homes and to agree with the public administration."
The President of the Regional Committee of Kalabrien Agazio Loiero does not understand that there is "all other than one exception in his region to join the connections of local administrations and organized crimes." "There are places where the concurrence of Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with which the police of Piromas was deceived.
Since the end of April, the assembly of Gioia Tauro has been solved, but since 1991, and at the same time because of the common connections between organized crime and local administration, the local officers of their communities have been rejected.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then citizen of the Udc, has been selected to the head of the Mediterranean Coalition by May 2006.
He cried scandal when the prefecture arranged the resolution of the Community.
He was interested in the Vice-Minist Marco Min, which he emphasized to have found everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges claimed that the Piroma-Clan had even expected to make an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing action related to the surveys of Dal Torrione, the pleasure has shown to meet the desires of an undertaking, which is, at the same time, a representative of the large group around the Piroma, which has been the same with the interests of the public administration."
When energy comes out of the walls, the big runs up
It is a non-successful source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface, and it seems to be understanding this world's large energy forms.
Wells, streams and times are the new renewable energy sources now looking at all, and also looking for occupation, such as gigants like Chevron.
The possibility to gain energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined since 70 years; these have not been adversely intensified since the first earthly oil crisis.
When the price of the oil was in 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organizations and the oil price were forced to make new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy produced by the oceans.
This is equal to the duplicate of the current energy produced by atomic powers.
Moreover, the streams and times are still covered.
Giants at the attack.
The first company, which now is on marine energy, is Enersis, who has undergone an agreement on the creation of a power work in North Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more companies from the traditional energy industry that put on marine energy winning.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – the speaker of a company of the US Gigant in Wall Street Journal – and weakens the opportunity to cooperate with us."
This concerns the acquisition of an authorisation of the Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project before the coast of Alaskas.
This is a not too appreciative sign, i.e. when you think that just in Alaska the Oil is continued to be promoted by the United States, and president Bush recently set the plans for new bubbles.
Besides Chevron, the firms Ver® Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new branch; if the details are not, the observers speak of an increased interest.
More valuable technologies.
Experts are talking about one of the technologies still existing in the broadcasting, which are not added, since the last doubts of the environment are not yet clearer.
To this end, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are very small and seem to have no serious environmental problems to be taken.
In order to produce energy at large level, however, technology needs greater impact on the environment.
There are different options: Ocean Power is about using a system of boys connected.
The whales swimming up and down the walls are converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming over the colves and cylinders.
This three places a turbine, which has a generator again.
The electricity is sent over underwater guides to the coast.
There are yet four planned installations of this type, which are still waiting for the State approval, and some of the energy obtained may also serve for military institutions.
For the same time, the Power already produces energy for a house of goods and a parking late with under-sea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the periods treat the turbines that are eating the generator through the coming movement.
According to the verse, a long snake of possible clients expects the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the wools, then the times.
A special interest, according to the Electricity Research Institute, is currently deserving the potential that is present in the time.
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind streams, sun streams and whales, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
The energy of time is just what federal states such as New York, Alaska and other coast countries have been planned for 2009 to invest 7.5 million in 2008.
