Europe's inflation goes out in food
The accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, should first be the gross growth of the price of food.
The increase in prices in November was greater than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the Union Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official provisions were only given as a 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), contrary to Northern American, British and Canadian, did not cut the basic interest, just as it was predicted that the reduction, as well as the increased prices of primary materials and the reduction of the forced park, would cause a spirit of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the rate of inflation below, but at least approximately two percent.
An analysis is set out, the ECB is located in the trap 22: "The inflation must be negotiated" so that it should not be involved in this topic later.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, struck the record of twelve years and increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent in Spain.
The inflation was shot into the euro area due to food and energy price galopants.
The quotations at the end of the wheat increased in a 88 per cent and also the cotisation of the soja alcan’s maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, there was much more to pay for vegetable oil and milk products in 2007.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year in 52 percent, reaching the black gold almost 100 dollars the barrile last month.
Inflation in 2008 will go from 2.1 per cent current to 2.5 per cent, instead of 1.9 per cent for 2009.
In the case of analystes, the annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months of approximately 3 per cent, but the average annual rate shall be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB reduces the interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup provides a governmental crisis
After a long time, for the beginning of December, the support of the Youth Democracy Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while Gallup has never experienced such a low level - 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of safe party electors - due to the greatest firmness of opposition electors - would mean a support for more than two thirds (a 71 per cent) against the support of one fifth part for socialists (a 20 per cent).
The investigation, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democracy Association would not reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary scene: its support within the entire population is of one two per cent.
Among safe electors there is one percent more of compassionates on both sides.
The economic environment continued to be deteriorated even in comparison to the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who have especially condemned the economic situation in the country, as 46 per cent other people believe that the situation is very bad.
The families, after the most hopeful expectations of the early and summer, are now more pessimist about changing their own economic situation.
As regards the next year, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth is expecting a improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, above any previous investigation of Gallup, considered that the President of the Government was more wrong than their functions.
13 per cent of the consultants trust or trust a lot in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population does not absolutely trust the Government Boss and 27 per cent does not trust the President of the Juvenile Democracy Alliance.
One of the indicators of the political situation's configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the disadvantage experienced in the face of the Governing Boss without a government change.
Since after the disturbances of October last year, 35 per cent believed that it would be desirable to keep in power to the Government and Government Boss, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, so the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest of the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of the questioned to the question of participation answered that it would be safely involved, and another 20 per cent said that it was to participate.
In comparative way, in "a general election to celebrate this Sunday", only 55 per cent of the population and 15 per cent believes their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt of the result of the popular consultation.
A 74 per cent of the population would disapprove the payment of studies rights, a 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions only among safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of electors would be the introduction of studied rights, the payment for medical consultations and the hospital attention.
The most dear is Auchan, the Tesco has made five prices
The average increase in the price level of 16 per cent was maintained by the hypermarketing of the trade triangle of Budaörs, with the difference that the VAT has not increased this year.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased in a average of 16 per cent in the Budaörs' gold triangle, the usual birth canastal of Napi's journal, but in all hypermarkeds a growth was very higher than the thousand HUF.
As in December last year, prices had already been "dispared" in the supermarkets of food, so there was no drastic emphasis in comparison with the high point of partition.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they had been able to buy at a very high price under the nine thousand HUFs, they can not do this for ten thousand today.
The Napi canastal in the studied hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest channel was 10 573 HUF.
(In 2003, that canastal covered 6800 HUF.)
The price of the Unicum and fisheries remained almost at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase in the poultry, the noise and the amacola seed was recorded.
The price of wheat and bread followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition does not reduce the product price by less than 200 HUF.
At the same time, it was amazing in this tent that the Coca-Cola price with redimable bottle cooked less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cooked only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in the Napi Auchan coast was the most face, as Cora the most beautiful.
Our estimates, regardless of the prices of Christmas last year, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with approximately 18 per cent of the prices in the Napi canastal.
Comparing the values of the most fashioned canasta of the past year with the most nice canasta of this year, the difference was a 12 percent, while the growth between the lowest of the past year and the face of this year was 21 per cent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
The average price growth was 1206 HUF last year, so during the last year's Christmas, the increase in the VAT was felt.
Exactly this was the process that decreased trade, the supermarkets were unable to make decisions on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the marketer wrongly plans the speed of a product, it may be a significant benefit in the margin that corresponds to the volume of sales.)
The increasing price of Napi's canastal is such extreme as the increase of the VAT, that the costest of 1720 HUF was higher than the value recorded in 2006, while in the most poor, the difference was only a 844 HUF.
This year has not occurred such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the most beautiful has also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Navy seasons, a catastrophic growth was recorded in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets increased more than 30 per cent the price of consumption articles of the first need.
( However, this does not necessarily confirm the numbers of the Central Statistics Office: this Office, in the case of some first needed foods, registered a price increase exceeding 30 per cent within 12 months.
For example, besides the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
In this last case it seems to be almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was pretty decent in comparison to the base year, only 10 per cent of price increase was registered in the worst cases.
All of the harine suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which can impose the drastic increase of prices even to the multinationals.
Hypermarkets are not charged with the golden triangle, they speak constantly of positive results.
Our experiences collected, most of the three visited tents, are no longer interested in prices.
From all products, large quantities are purchased, the preserved food is taken by palettes.
On Wednesday morning, in the three tents, large boxes were made before the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that sales volumes within the country are lower, many multinationals are complainted to investigation institutions because income remains under their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the electrodomestics.
In many hospitals, the disinfectants are covered
This year, several thousand infections produced first by the independent application of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals.
The conditions of hygiene dominant in hospitals, the creation of beds and the overload of the staff do not promote the control of infections - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In many hospitals, it is even covered with desinfectants.
No longer a contact with MRSA has been made in the Hospital Janos Traumatology Department.
In a hospitalized man after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic resistant antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of county occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
An injury of a serious car accident was given high from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital soon as he had the MRSA contagio, and since then an important surgery intervention could not have been performed by the presence of the territory in its body.
Until 10 December of this year, the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System has been registered 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistance agents - said Karolina Böröcz, Departmental Director of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistent agents has been registered in hospitals, and that there is no information left.
Some of the two third parts of the infections (683 cases) are debt to the MRSA, namely Staphylococcus aureus, resisting meticiline-oxaciline.
A third of human beings bring the staphylococcus aureus (SA) into their nose without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g. inflammation of the garment, amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of wounds) reverses well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, when the antibiotics are applied excessively or inadequately, the antibiotics that normally reverse well are transformed into very resistant antibiotics and quickly affect inadequate hospital conditions.
Severe hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicemia, may be caused first in patients with transitional or chronic immune deficiency, patients with weak body, elderly or few-weighted.
In view of the doctor-director of Hospital Yanos, there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only off," said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resist to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the staff of the staff would take care of them in guys of gome and mask, and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not if so the infection can be avoided in all cases.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital in the majority of cases, but the current national hospital conditions do not promote the prevention of training and contact with multiresident patogen agents -— Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is mainly produced in hospitals and households of elderly, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, the taking of microbiological samples is not moderate.
This is also due to that the National Health Board does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come out to the public light when MRSA's infections are already produced in the patient - said the epidemiological division pharmacist.
The European Union makes rigorous recommendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicines and there are also national directives to treat pathological infections and tables.
An antibiotic therapy should be conducted, or microbiological examinations, to prevent resistance against drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The taking of microbiological samples is even less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or in the basic assistance - Karolina Böröcz.
Defectants are broken down
Scient experiments have shown that in most cases, MRSA is related to a patient to a healthy staff.
Therefore, they play a very important role in lavating hands, use of gome and masks, but in this regard significant failures are also experienced in hospitals.
The MRSA is counted by the transmission of bottles and direct contact between persons, but in national hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the patient concerned.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often aborted, beds are often very together, even though to prevent epidemia, patients should be separated at least by 1.5 meters distance.
Sorry, it can also be experienced - appealed Karolina Böröcz - that in the less favourable economic situation hospitals, there are few and many patients, and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In view of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate preventive measures are fulfilled, less infections of this type are recorded or the county of the patogen agent can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA contagio is an enormous expenditure for the National Sickness Fund, so in all countries it fights.
For example, in England there is a Government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
It seems that the programme has success, if the data provided, MRSA infections show a decrease trend in England.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Sickness (ECDC) has between its priorities the prevention of multi-resistance agents (including MRSA) and the hospital infections due to these patogenic agents.
Negative alcoholic control of the police commander that caused a mortal accident
The Periodic official report on the case of the death accident caused by the Police Commander of Title XXII has been made.
It can be excluded the possibility that he was driveing a drink or in a strict state from then released Commander of the Police of the XXII Police, which on Wednesday and caused the death of a transaction - informed Attila Morvai, carrier of the Capital General Fisheries, after preparing the Periodic report on the case.
The Periodic report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcohol, which had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic drink before it was put behind the floor.
The leader of the Police Commissioner of the 20th, Tuesday with its special vehicle by doubleing the Kossuth Lajos Street of the XXII Street, hit a 55-year-old man, who wanted to cross the street, but not in the area designed for peatons.
(This last fact, that the peaton doesn't use the cebra to cross the street, if the rules of the Tranchito Code are not adequate conditions, the driver must always cease the step to double.)
The transaction lost life after having been hospitalized.
As a result, the police leader of the ́s ́s ́t dismissed and requested its jubilation, it was the police's communication, because he was very moved to the case.
The investigation of the case is at the Budapest Research Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from a beginning cooperated with the fiscals responsible for investigation.
400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister Janos Veres and the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday three credit limit agreements in Budapest for a total value of 400 million euros to finance infrastructures of education, transport and environment as well as energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of 300 million euros for financing in the Hungarian budget for projects of transport and environmental protection, which will be carried out from the subvention of cohesion funds, from which the parties have already signed a credit contract for a value of 100 million, the contract that they have just signed is related to the use of the rest of 200 million euros.
The credit contract of EUR 150 million is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB has approved in total 300 million euros for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the rest of 150 million euros, the decision will be taken later by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovation, which will mainly use the budget for the project of innovations and research at the University of Debrecen.
The discussions also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that, when Hungary finally met with the EU the details of the Metro financing, they will again discuss the subject that if necessary or not amend the original contract and how to do so.
Se_ Janos Veres, this may take place early in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed in total 113 projects in Hungary by EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a 8-year-old profit period without covering the committee to maintain the debt's debt.
Bulgaria, the EU's immobile paradise
It is amazing that the developing of the Bulgarian immobiliary market - the attention of all Europe is addressed to that Balkan country, which was recently mentioned.
What, where and where, and who purchasing the EU market, is still more nice, which will be quickly carrying out?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for immobiliary acquisitions in Eastern Europe is, of course, some Bulgaria, with its beautiful apartments of the squire tracks and the chalets of the beaches.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, as in the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are looking for immobile in the areas of Kavarna and Balchik.
The analystes of Re/Max in Bulgaria, late or early, also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will wake the interest of the immobiliary promotors and more people will buy immobile in the special nice area of Russia.
Similarly, the Sophia capital can be attractive, trade spaces and offices promise a quick recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, which can also be a highlighted destination during the two other stations, as well as the summer and winter.
Therefore, precautioned investors have already purchased their purchases, for example in the areas of Bansko.
In view of the analystes, those who buy immobile in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Moreover, Maltese and Cypriot promotors are present and traditionally there are many Russian customers in the Black Sea beaches and in the Sky Paradise.
Foreign customers can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to be installed here buy new or renewed to a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or well old houses in bad state between 5 and 15 thousand euros to renew them later.
They need good communication and access, and for them the neighborhood of a large city, the tents and generally a local doctor.
The second category consists of chalet buyers (Bulgaria was included in December between the first 10 Vacational destinations of Germans).
The third group constitutes the real estate investors who purchase their purchases with the hope of benefit at a middle or long term.
The price of capital immobile is in constant growth, as the request is always greater.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent in the last five years.
The increase in the price of immobile is considered as the growth of the salaries.
Food and six percent of Hungarian
The Ministry of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor has been informed that meetings at expert level will be completed on Tuesday, and Wednesday after official injury will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and political experts from 192 countries in the world will determine on the Balí Road Sheet, which provides on the following efforts for the period of reduction of employment, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, until 2012.
Now there are encouraged discussions on the particularity of developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States have already indicated that it does not want to negotiate with precise numbers at the present, although it intends to reach the agreement that, in comparison with the 1990 situation, it reduces by 25 to 40 per cent the emission of gases responsible for the inverter effect.
Another major issue of the conference is that if industrialized countries, as well as reductions, are willing to provide material and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
A further agreement on the aid to provide developing countries was reached.
The support fund, provided in the Kyoto Protocol, will be addressed by an integrated guideline advice by 16 members, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Ministry of Environment and Waterology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role of preservation in global climate protection and to promote the signature of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister declared that the EU was committed to reducing until 2020, as regards 1990, to 20 percent of its gas employment, responsible for the inver-effect, whether it would be signed or not the "consense after 2012" and is willing to compromise to decrease even 30 per cent if the other large world-wide regions and developing countries are also willing to take commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signature countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 were committed to decrease at 5.2 per cent, and then the 15 EU Member States committed a 8 per cent decrease.
The complaint of Hungary is to reduce with a 6 per cent gas emissions responsible for the inverro effect for the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply - indicates the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
It is a lot of what is in Balí, since within two years it will be necessary to sign the international climate policy agreement for long-term, because, if not, it is certain that its entry into force would take place for 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments taken in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of lusts, which was warned in its latest report by the IPCC, the international citizenship of the United Nations, which is occupied with climate change, which was obtained by the Nobel Premium of Peace.
Consequently, the reduction of employment would suffer a delay and could not prevent more than 2° C of the average Earth temperature, which would have uncondensable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army reclutes in YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) was the use of YouTube services: the special units moved in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - informed the BBC.
These places are made with mini-mounted cameras on casks are controlled in the Kandahar general body of operations, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 resulting soldiers from air forces which have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "canal" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Defence Ministry was registered in the first century 2007 under the name of "Defence headquarters" and published videos of actions made in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the United Nations Community Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have its own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had loaded videos with reclusing objectives, but in the Minister for Defence also served to present the public the real objective of the presence of the British Army in the outer hand.
This type of propaganda costs almost nothing in comparison with conventional television reclutting spots - stated to the BBC the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevit ́e have some political message, since in a specific way they justifie the reason for being military action decided by the government.
Americans prepared a video game
The exercise is also concerned about the fact that, besides the resolutely edited and censured events, the distributor also shows adequate videos, such as the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, some hypocrites, officers speak as a maximum loss, however, without presenting the blooding part of the fight.
Furthermore, of Iraq and Afghanistan's battle fields have been loaded on the Internet many videos in real operations, but the British army is only lastly using this opportunity.
Americans use a little different way for recluding with shooting videos, freely, called America's Army, where in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can be placed directly instead of soldiers.
Salted tomb and sandwich at the Ministerial Christmas Festival
It does not seem very sensitive to the Monique Lamperth Work Minister: instead of the Christmas Festival, he will celebrate a job for his colleagues who will be able to delay in 2007 with salt and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, in another, they will create the Navy Atmosphere in the heart of the public officers with tombol and a brindis.
Festival, Christmas environment, concerts and buffet - so you divorce the power.
State offices are also prepared for Christmas.
The greatest Christmas Festival will be held at the Defence Minister, but not for the workers of the Minister.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts at the Harf's Christmas and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited to the family of the soldiers who are currently performing missions in the outside.
This portfolio will determine 25 million for the festival of the end of the year.
The National Footnote Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a nice party with regard to the other portfolio feasts
The feast of the MET will be held at the House of Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers in the ministry, expected of approximately 300 fifty.
At the holiday of the wallet, a Christmas environment will rule, will also act artists and will have a chance of tobular.
ANNF's birthday costed 4 700 000 HUF and was celebrated on Wednesday in the National Justice Council (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinners.
The winner of the room costed a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers of one of the UNF Departments are also invited to another Christmas Festival to celebrate a Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose, they achieved the full building of the Comedia Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA because we are not able to communicate with the competent person.
You can be assisted without trace
The CNAJ building had not only attended the party of the ANSF but also the Minister for Justice and Police, which celebrated the dance of Lucia on 7 December, instead of Christmas.
The CNAJ of them did not cover anything for their installations.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The festival started with the Minister's health words and after the dinner there was a living bailable music.
They answered the question of [original]: To attend the dance, it was not obliged to dress or clothing at night.
Health, work and local administrations are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a feast for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the contrary, the Minister for Lamperth’s Work does not expect its colleagues for a Christmas official party, but for an end-year work.
It is considered to participate in hundred eighty guests that, as the press department would report, will take only coffee and salted pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Ministry of Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, in exchange, will simply broke with his colleagues at the Ministry of Local Governments and Territory Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a shipmates at its own hall of acts with 436 employees.
The Navy Festival will have a budget of 2500 HUF per invitation - of this budget will be paid for the receipt with buffet and a brindis.
Since Janos Veres is the Minister, MF workers celebrate the Christmas each year in the same way.
However, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a receipt of New Year on 20 January, in the Ministry the Christmas will not be celebrated.
The receipt will be celebrated in the Vajdahunyad Castillo of the Municipal Park and the portfolio has been communicated, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for hundred guests.
This is the press department - it will be a very simple stage receipt, which will be invited only to specialized diplomatics believed in Hungary.
These receipts, which are celebrated every year, begin with a short speech of the Minister's health and finish with a modesty food.
The Ministries of Foreign and Education and Cultural Affairs will not celebrate any Christmas Festival - this is what the relevant press departments have communicated to [original].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were not able to inform the budget of the Navy celebrations of the Minister.
What is known is that for the festival that will be celebrated at the Museum of the Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant wheel have been gathered
Liga Syndicates and the National Federation of Work Commissions will constitute on Wednesday a cooling committee to coordinate the moon's hole that will last for indefinite time.
The Sabbath will be celebrated a middle of protest, while on Monday - on the day on which the final vote on public health law will be held - the workshop will be started.
This action will make great difficulties in the transport, since the railway transit will be completely held, and until 13 hours, the workers of the Budapest Collektiv Transport Business will also be in the hall.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Liga Sindicates will inform the details of their hole on Monday that will celebrate together with the National Federation of Working Commissions.
It will also be the Court Committee of the LIGA and the National Syndicate of Machinists to coordinate the action of Monday.
The Sabbath will be celebrated a middle of protest, so that the participant syndicates will be pronounced on Monday for a time indefinitely, unless an agreement with the Government is reached.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report the date of the end of the beginning floor.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the syndicates will immediately revoke their call to the hall.
However, if the law is approved, the wedding committees will be gathered and will decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda on Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that it is only voted on public health law in the very hours of the night, or at the best close to midnight.
As a result of the hole that will be started on Monday, it will be necessary to count significant difficulties in transport: in railways it will stop working for indefinitely, at the morning a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the interurban bus transport of Volán companies.
Similarly, in many points of the country there will be a closed half of the roads.
Numerous syndicates and civil organizations have been attached to the hole, their names are constantly updated on the Liga Website.
Some of the universities announced their wedding for indefinitely, others for time defined.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Iron Carril State and the Free Friend of Ferroviary Workers (SL·) could not reach a agreement or even if it had regarded the minimum services, though, when the Christmas Festivals were approached, they were more people traveling on trains.
The information received until now, from the beginning of the day to the 13 hours, will be in the hall of the workers of the Budapest Collektiv Transport Undertaking, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 of the morning, the Sciences of the LIGA Industrie of Thermal Energy and Educators called on a 2-hour 2-8-hour Democracy Science of Educators.
The Hungarian Physician Association will be pronounced in national hours in alternative hours and the Democratic Science of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) who are part of the Simplies Forum of Cooperation, shall celebrate a warning hours of two hours.
The most important of the four requests made by the Liga is that the Government rejects its proposal on public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second request is that they gradually introduce the new form of estimation of pensions that will enter into force in the next year.
The third is that they, even before 2010, ensure that for advanced pensions the possibility of employment that it deserves to be able to enter into the system.
The fourth reason for the wheel is that the Free Training Workers' Science (SL); which is part of the Liga Sindicators, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on railway sidelines and expects another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by Hungarian Guarantee
The Division of Riesgos Analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital is the activity of Hungarian Guarantee, constituted in August this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company's "warning on risks" is written: With regard to Hungarian Guarantee's activity, the greatest political risk is that "with the increase in existing ethnic pressures between the Gitanian and non-Gitana population of Hungary, even short-term violent ethnic attitudes".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of Hungarian Guarantee is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - appealed to the representative of the investigation institution.
They acknowledged that all this was due to one of the main deficiencies of Hungarian political protagonists: "the protagonists of public life ceased the public debate of the Gitan problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, which could base their political strategy on existing discriminations between gitan and Hungarian."
This enhances the problem, impossibles the normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the probability of enlargement of violent conflicts - estimate.
Furthermore, research institution, national guard activity, due to the great attention of the national and international average, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary outside, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are recalled that: since 2006, the reorganization of the radical and extreme groups of Hungary has been obtained in the country, and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been automatically defined by "national self-defence associations".
"The common race of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while they openly announce the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, public defence) by appealing to the ineptitudes of the police, the exercise, namely from the State. "
They aspired: All this is done in accordance with the method that gives it a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the disapproval of society with political and political parties.
You can highlight civility and the form of association in the case of these associations, not only to avoid legal issues of legal registration, but also a political strategy.
Analysis is, Hungarian Garden's activity is also a risk factor from the view of neighborhood relations.
"In the past months, in many neighbouring states, Hungarian Guarantee has been referring to a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalistic policies of certain neighbor countries want to justifie their own anti-Hungary policy with the creation of Hungarian Guarantee,
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
The investigation institution is established, the constitution of Hungarian Guarantee is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and East Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that Hungarian Guard works in such a way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbations of the gitanians that have occurred in one of the Sophia (Krasna Poliana).
By using this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
In its opinion, in the past 17 years there was a "Gitanic terror" in Bulgaria, but the State remained impotent and indifferent in the case of facts - reaffirms the Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has caused an enhanced debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic employment, which some gitan organizations of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will be their own guard.
As Hungarian Guarantee has yet shown similarities to the Bulgarian National Guarantee, it is not possible to be excluded that Hungarian gitans are also threatened in similar way, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital.
The Director of Political Capital Research, Attila Juhász at the question of the News Agency, affirmed: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can affect the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning on risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the Law determines exactly the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that I turn to the festivals - that the next year will be less - reorganized working days.
Not if it is in the EU or in North America, it is a party.
Hungarian laws make a distinction between national festivals, State feasts and festivals.
Festival days are fundamentally related to religious and historical festivals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festival - this is the last, especially so that those who have passed the old year can rest.
Every year we have 11 holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May the feast of work, on 1 and 2 November we remember our dead family and friends.
Moreover, in our country there are two days Festivals of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
It is the calendar, our state, national or religious festivals often match a weekend, so it is often made powerful when there is only one working day before or after the festival.
In addition to the weekend ends that are extended, during the previous Sabbath, it cannot be disabled from work or from school.
It is the Minister of Work that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in the exchange of the day directly or later to the festival.
This legal standard is of mandatory compliance for all patrons and their employees, as well as for public employees and officers.
It is not obligatory in exchange for enterprises and services institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the festivals.
This year the working order can only be changed around the end of the year's festivals: from 24 December it is practically stopped life in the country, since experiences are held, most people "make power" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
The next year, several of our festivals will match half or weekend, so there will be less changes in work days than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified to the holiday of work so that the workers may then rest for four days.
The Sabbath, April 26, will be working day, so that on Wednesday, on Friday 2, May, the festival day will be changed.
The second change relates to the festival of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, it will be necessary to work instead of Friday 24.
However, the year that comes at the end of the year can be rested, since from 24 December it will not work at almost any part, nor even the last day of the year is a midnight.
Six little disappointments to worry about your colleagues' lives
Emails that we have sent, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that pass us without notice: all of them are part of our Folclore' daily work.
It is necessary to decide whether you adjust to the small tribulations or avoid conscious confusions that can irritate others.
Councils.
Excuse me, I was invited to warn you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a meeting?
In the best of the cases it feels and repairs the matter, the best calls the marketing department to tell you that it has been given to you the message (that is the less usual solution).
In most cases, the matter is resolved by demanding excuses.
Before walking to bochorous explanations, it deserves the penalty to meditate on things with which you can worry about your colleagues' life and strive consciously to avoid them.
Do you take something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more irritant than when you want to pick a document, a Office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
Remember that you put the tape on the table yesterday, but for this morning she disappeared?
Do you find your lost boligraph on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't remove anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll be angry with you for subtracting their things.
Don't shoot over or post-it of the office because it can be unappreciable when you need them immediately and get exhausted before the time.
Chissing about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop sounds that are already running.
Who, what's he doing and with who?
Where and why?
Don't pass everyone the information you have on your colleagues' particular life!
Don't abuse your colleague's confidence when you're with you his most intimate secrets!
Enter in yourself what you have heard and don't judge your colleague in his absence, even though others also know his things.
Are you licensing for sickness unjustly?
When you call the office and say you're insoported and you're painful, you feel bad or well, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think that others should do your job, your uninterruptible tasks, your work for a time.
Don't hurt your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay home, communicatives, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to cope with you on the next day.
Tarares, riots, telephone calls
You're in your work, but you're thrown out of him the ridicules of your colleagues?
Did you involvingly hear a telephone conversation that would have been better not listening to her?
Don't disappoint your colleagues with your tarares, songs, talks in high voice (mince when you do them above their head), battles, constant blasfemys, expressing your disappointments in high voice.
All of these can be troubled, although they are not currently depthing in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
You don't blame others if you haven't finished anything at time, you have been invited to send a important letter or a message!
Don't let the chaos eventually rule in the office, nor the voice that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have done a mistake that hurts others and you have to repair the missing!
Ask how you can repair your missing!
Do you feel too home at the office?
Jogging and shoes: very comfortable habit for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging although your occupation allows it!
Don't be disregarded, respect your colleagues and yourself dressing daily, elegant and nice clothes when your occupation so requires it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the public's expectations
The car goes slowly on the habitual attack of the morning.
It sounds a strange composite in the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm getting the volume.
Change the time of music and to the previous tons the low is added and then the voice of a female coro as a true joy intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
National musical life didn't hurt us much with electronic pop of quality.
But now this attack seems totally different when you're listening to the new disc of Zagar.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the subground [b2]digital [b3] nationally shortly will change the image and even though it is mode again the rock garage style, broken guitars, the national pop electro has demonstrated: there are news under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pıs, touched the Yonderboi set until he started his independent career maybe because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With your project (Zagar) and your music, a jazz mixer, a bailable electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph when you asked sound tracks [b4] cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Thuruk Sezon).
The largest public knew the total that in principle only acted in small clubs when the magazine wan2 chose its first disc edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national discs, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as the only national trainer of trends, which could also be sold in the West markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are mode, but no one has asked them if they carry this label or not pleasantly.
The total repeated how it should re-work: prepared a new and even better disk.
The recently launched disk, entitled Cant Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the own title intends to set the continuity with the initial years in the city of P′s.
Then this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference on the airo, on the flight, but beyond the airo of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of the rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the disc in the Millenaris György Ligeti, the song who currently works in England with the whole The Puzzle.
The disc includes a real success of the Mr2 Petõfi channel that last transmits from the morning to the popular evening music. This ́ora led to the ears of the radiogens the high flight music of Wings of Love, with six Hungarian songs (Divas Underground).
Then everything's okay (?).
Hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what you're interpretating, in what way is a music dedicated to a selected public?
Zságer Balázs: Selected public definition for me means little.
In my opinion there are two kinds of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative music underground can also be buried, without meaning and can be composed to the same only for sale, which makes it commercially.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The hearers also work with this spirit, independent of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between your music acceptance by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign, especially in the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
This is not only the fifty-twenty-year generations of the concerts, but also the elderly.
They give much more attention to changes in light music around them, because they consider it part of modern culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
You care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I feel well seeing you've always attended more people at our concerts.
But we never composed music for the market.
We're not composing music for any purpose, but for any reason.
The role of the public is most likely in the concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the inconscient changes of the time.
Yet, I realized that if you want to fulfill the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what point do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has made his career better in the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow his way, although sometimes they try to compare our music with it.
More we work in team, we trust in the musical presence of the other and let it turn out.
In a principle, it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi music, since many of us start our career in their group and we take another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of Mr Petõfi Wings of Love is first.
Many people first listened to Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you open consciously with this style to a larger row?
Zs.B.: We didn't want to compose great successes and sell with these successes our disk.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the hardest topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a core in the gospel style.
Then I saw the idea of creating this core of the solists of good voice from our own national music scenario.
That coron of six women - whether Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Jude Németh - was then baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly make the song or girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song was a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the disc, we thought something still missing.
The agreement attached the song.
Still that night I took the song that the girls later had.
Everything came almost to the first intention and incrediblely spontaneous form.
I remember, I was very enthusiastic then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, I wouldn't have worked so much.
hvg.hu: At the concert as well as on the disc it seems like if girls were in the background.
There are no solists (excluding the short only of Judy Jay), they have no own paper, they sing together and not more stronger than music, so music is not only accompanied by their songs.
The scenario is also located in the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're just in the background for technical problems.
Instead, we didn't want to distribute solist papers.
The song also turns on it, on which we have a mouse of our ego, who is from where he has come and where he goes, let us let those wings, the wings of love, raise us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel that state of euforic encouragement that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: To what more work did you dedicate?
Zs.B.: In the musical composite actually no, rather than in the time of mixture, there were more difficult parts.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert plan or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work the groove for a long time, and then, almost at a little while, everything was placed in his place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "suspend" the disc.
Now the prophet is a fool, the escape from the Earth and the Never The Same.
A cursing bottle traitor risks thousands of millions of millions for its degree of minority
A disloyal wrongdoer.
It is as it indicates to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French giant banker of Societé General, also owner of the Czech Commerce Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a big player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and, of course, with good capacity.
He has taught a long ago, in contrast to all the large Czech Republics, the crisis in the American hypothics market.
"He has a fragil character" let him hear of his superiors, the same as they sent to the police.
But what is denied from Kerviel's answers is what the French communications media, such as Le Monde journal, are that it was a man who had a profit of over 1,600 million euros at the end of the past year, thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was wining money for my own," he assured his answers.
Exactly, in the summer, he was able to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news about sub-prime hypotech calls offered to low income clients or those who had problems with payments in the past and that these customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and aposted correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.600 million.
"When I won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify it," Kerviel confesses and adds that nothing has been left for himself, absolutely.
The whole questionnaire stated that it had made registrations so that it had not reached its discovery.
He even came to misleading the boss, even when the Eurex Bolsa began to be interested in his business.
The risk became beneficial
Should you find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won 1.600 million for the employment and that from that simple fact, that would be joyful for you."
Where did he get so much willingness from that way to risk himself?
I had to work gradually in my position.
He entered to work at General Society in 2000, exactly after the end of study in Lyon.
Its annual sale was handled between $51,000.
Two years later, he was a carrier of Bolsa, and in 2005 he became a bottle carrier with a year of $90,000.
Still so I knew I would never win as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I have already noted that they looked carefully at me.
Because of my training and my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described researchers.
But at the short time of my entrance in the company, the first great success arrived.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a 500 million euro title below.
And this was a launch mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, let's leave you.
"This is like a snow ball," said the police.
But it is said that the chiefs knew all of this or that they were more suspicious of it.
"When he won money, they closed their eyes."
Only then, the hit came at the beginning of this year.
On one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the end of the week to January half, he wanted to delete every floor.
When Monday came to work, I wasn't working on the work anymore.
And two days later, the announcement announced that he had lost $5 billion for his fault.
And how could they find him?
He's been suspected from his vacations.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor that has no vacuations is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to look at his document," Kerviel ended.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to achieve 365 billion
Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic could achieve 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels for 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will exit approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be assigned to transport, up to 150 billion billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State fund for infra-transports that will count in the next year with the amount of 90.800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve businessmen and enterprises to gain resources in the innovation of business.
Undertakings should be financed for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recent income countries as less they use them.
For twenty years for the president of Nicaragua, the court decreed
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed on Thursday the 20-year penalty for the president of the country, Arnaldo German, which was condemned in 2003 by 100 billion dollars (approximately 1.800 million crowns).
Nevertheless, a while later, he was released from the prison to pass to home arrest in his nearly far from the metropolis nicaranse.
There is nothing clear at these moments, the AP agency is that, then, the head of the Central American State between 1197 and 2002, is again between resources.
The President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, will be more dependent on penitentiary agents if they leave Germany to finish their penalty at home or to return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed that Germany continued to transfer the government's money to the account of a company in Panama.
This company was ficticity, and the account was actually belonging to his closest family and parties.
A part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
The budget was thus approved
That's it.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first established by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without support of opposition.
The budget of this year was already approved with the support of the CSSD, since Minister Sobotka and CSSD prepared it could not be allowed to not accept it.
In addition to various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the Government, there was nothing dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view, even though the most influent, adopted the new law quietly.
It's a big paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and part of the budget, pleases them or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it is hidden by the rivality of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media, and therefore they dedicate you special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The Budgets of the State of the latest governments of social democrats suffered from three deficits that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as the costs of mandataries which are not only pensions but also the social provisions which have been approved last year before the "silence" coalition of the CHSSD and KSČM elections.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
However, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and under control.
However, the hour bomb is located in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many employees to be able to obtain other sources of investment, except money from taxes, taxes and credits, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they had unproportionately engaged in their assemblies.
In recent years, these debts were able to be paid through the massive sale of energy and other development networks received from the state and privatisation.
They are not currently accounting for this resource.
If we focus only on official and checked facts, we find out that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has passed through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, what the CSSD is shaken.
This was the ideal opportunity that his government would order the state's finances.
However, instead of that, the state continued to be demanded.
The rest of countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economyed much more than our Republic.
It is a great view that falls, especially, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that we are less threatened by poverty within the global measures.
Therefore, social massive programmes are not needed that, unfortunately, in recent years have been unnecessary with giant measures.
And although they have been able to remove part of the incomprehensible popular expenditures approved this year before elections, if the age of jubilation and reform of pensions is not shortly changed, then the end of any policy in this country will be actually, and the Government will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that government politicians will be converted into officers, mechanical distributors of most of the money of the fees for jubilation and social performance.
Therefore, the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal costs of the mandatary expenditure.
The deficit planned for more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not misleaded what they could in the past ten years.
We do not want the political rulers to become only officers, therefore, to be patient and to grant this weak coalition of the government, which is not aware that the state can only cost what is able to get from taxes and taxes, peace for the preparation of other legislative reforms.
Only this will enable the paulatin achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, its and Canada decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the monetary market, more than 100 billion dollars will be received by claims.
In these claims, the interest rates are based on the interests for which they are able to provide money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will facilitate the central Europe and its.
After the attacks of September 11, it is the first time that centralities of different states are agreed in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the largest economic problem, i.e. the continuing growth of the free capital absence that the people could provide" wrote in their client report, Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group Advisory Company.
"This coordinated action of the Central Affairs has probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," added Baumohl in his report.
The loans have already spent $60 billion in charged loans, especially in the United States.
Economys are still waiting for thousands of millions of losses.
"The centrals must really be afraid of what they expect yet when they decided to do this step," said ABN Amro's main economicist, Kieran Davies.
"The situation seems to be really bad," he added.
Central authorities fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will have to provide their customers more costly.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to the recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central authorities decided that, after they could not reduce the called LIBOR tariff, London interbank tariff used for money loan on the interbank market.
This means that the people were constantly afraid of paying money even when the United States Central Banks, Canada and Great Britain decreased their interest rates several times during the holiday.
"He will have the same effect as another fall of interest rates," he said to the Regis, Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus Consulting company.
Some economys do not surprise that the step given by centrals contributes to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the immobile market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of theologists are incredible
Global climate change affects mostly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the problem of global heating.
The criticism has now occurred with the conclusion of the United Nations international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book A, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of theologists are incredible.
See Klaus is not only acceptable to the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the retoric used and the reality.
"There are only debates, are artificial fires of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech Chairman under the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important for him and that it is so interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated to the German because, as he said, "I often only meet with the loading of my ideas."
Now interested ones can be informed about their various opinions.
Klaus remembered that it is not a climatologist but that you have, you have your opinion, enough doubts as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized disertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economicist.
At the main time of the clause, it expressed its thinking that climate is constantly changed and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between sciences, that the consequences of current changes are not so big and serious, and that the efforts to influence climate development are inutile, inefficient and costly inacceptable.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with the total we consider not acceptable to introduce not-proved opinions to others, which feels a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
The issues of the present have repeatedly explained that it is not against "the reasonable environmental defensors but against militarists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same subject was Klaus in Vienna two months ago in the Hayes Instituto.
600 thousand people haven't been able to change their sheep to drive
In six hundred thousand drivers, the date was passed, and thus they were not able to change their old sheep to drive whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today, it is the last day when people can ask for changes so that the officers may take time to the end of the year to issue the new sheep.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new Year, hundreds of thousands of leaders without the valid sheep are found.
Traffic is held, the sheep has not changed it mainly those who would even want to drive it.
While the people announce a quick decrease in the exchange of sheep, the metropolis offices are filled with requests and the interest in the new sheep has increased.
The Assembly calculates approximately 2.000 daily customers.
The halls are waiting for a half hour.
In Prague, the new sheep has not yet been taken about 140,000 drivers.
The emission of a new sheep last twenty days.
However, the emission of the sheep may be requested within a shorter term of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
The drivers who are obligatory to change their sheep and do not reach until the end of the year, but they will go out to the roads without the valid sheep shall be risked by January.
The criminal will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the offence with a demonstration.
In the case of administrative infraction, the charge will be 2.500 crowns.
Previous information can be received by a person who doesn't go anywhere.
They could probably pay up up to 30,000 crowns.
The Minister invited the offices to enter moderately thousand crowns in, as maximum.

The Court reduced the penalty to Berdych's complies
The former police Joseph Opava and Petr Koňařk accused of complication with the criminal David Berdych will pass between thirty and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive end to the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives of the Department were committed against organized crime, at the beginning, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Only by revocation by the Supreme Court, the decision of today cannot be revoked.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he first expects the Court of First Instance's sentence.
Despite this, in other processes, a total of 16 years has been sentenced.
You can't get anymore.
In January, the Court of Affairs recognized the participation in 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, revoked 16 of them.
The majority of the accusations of the accused were taken by the investigation for the causes of invented causes.
The Senate of Central Bohemia, the police members in accordance with Berdych sent information from police sources to criminals, covered the robes, and helped criminal group members to avoid penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their robe to Opava and Koňarik.
The accusation refers to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to the robe, their victims have suffered serious effects on their health, but they are also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without weapons.
In the home register, the police found guns, municipality with steel, a laser manager and an ammetral.
The group of criminals, the accusation, stole tens of millions of crowns.
Except almost twenty men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other guilty guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pot and Maroš Šulej, who for now have avoided the judgment, are in prison in Ireland where they expect the definitive decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
A account for change of children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity House, Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Träbič 12 million compensation crowns more the expenditure of the judgment.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers at least 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
"This request we don't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today.
"In order to make an idea of this proposal, we need the report of the expert that the opposite party has sent to investigate.
We'll be sure if you have a resurrective value.
We will keep ourselves in the opinion that they will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal highlighted.
The amount should be moved between the 100,000 and the 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloň’s family wanted, each month, that they did not create her biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velava was used as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the report of the expert, only that it was developed in the Motol's faculty hospital in Prague.
Children's parents are specialists in psychology and psychiatricity and have suffered of psychic and stress at different levels and depths.
The situation of stress was better supported by men, even though they were fighting for the change of girls.
Women bring him worse with the trauma they are currently living and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola have been changed by the mother's house in Träbič last year, the nineth December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Chermakov and Pribyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloń.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčich, delivered at the end of October to each family 1000,000 crowns as compensation costs for the error made in the hospital of Träbič that the region manages.
All Czech Republic hospitals are assured by law as responsibilities for damage.
In the case of errors, they must be removed from the reserve fund and may be extraordinaryly requested for aid to the administrator.
The court until today recognised a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated are the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of a million crowns.
Polyvka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the fight on the brand of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
The Court of Ostrava was the first that uses the brand of the Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomás Harabish with which the actor cooperated.
Polyvka hasn't been presented in oral view today.
Your lawyer's lawyer is probably not finished and your client will recover.
"The pleit consists that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," he said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and the comic comes to all the world.
The same idea has Harabish too.
"We followed us about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the pleasure is in the money.
" After years, I realized that the project was successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
The court was used first by Polívka in its television programme.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzobohati was coroned.
Then it wasn't trying to direct it to the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later in Harabish, the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia came to be edited.
From that comic origin, there was a profitable business and business activity from which Harabish later created the Kingdom Society of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered his disregarded owners to the visitors of his farm and assistants to their spectacles.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today the Court also decided that Harabish only uses a simple idea that Polívka has made public at the scenario for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka has helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
However, he added that in the spirit of the project, Harabish and his team, who were completely dedicated to it.
The cooperation, among the decompressed parts today, continued until 2000 when Harabish organized the official coronation in Vsetin for Polívka.
Since that moment, they began to conflict between Polívka and Harabish whose culmination came with the deterioration of the " King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabish's mediation, was in the song Jarmila Šulaková, as a mother's queen.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabish and his society that has been sent by the court until today.
Something clearly could bring in the litigium, the tourning through the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabish.
The new king should go out of him.
You did not want to browse more data or dates.
"We don't have any speed.
I'd have to be something like the road of the king to Moravia.
The king should be chosen at a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can be presented." Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: overflow
To say truth, I never liked too much Peugeotu 206.
His travel characteristics were never a special thing, the quality of the change box, the handbook and the product could also be characterized as under the average.
But now there is on the market its follower, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I'm just gonna think it better.
When I tried the Classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I claimed, for example, the headspace in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi carrier means in this sense, that I will not suffer at the two meters of length.
Flighting through the World
I'm going through the inside quickly so that I don't repeat it too much.
It is a elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here would be more valuable the design invention even though the car seems to be pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we were laughing for short seats and supports.
In contrast to model 206, the side direction has also improved consideration.
And the space? and here you can feel how the carrying measures have grown.
In the Combi, the cited absence of space in the header disappears.
Maletic maletes
But the main thing in this vehicle is your malter.
I must appreciate it as very harmful (but thanks to the back-to-door port) and a well-scale storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with gome mails that provide a ideal solution.
They are not molecular, and they can be extended to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But let's stay in the deposit.
Tables are included, in the basic regime, a capacity of 428 litres is more than a average value in comparison with competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type of most sold in the Czech Republic, the Schkoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, we find that Peugeot remains at the jack with its perceptible 52 litres.
From holidays to foreign or when putting the child's cocktail is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive, then I have to quote the floor that remains quite plain after cutting the backups of the second line.
120 horses in four walks
Our car tested was equipped with an injection starting of four vaults on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to say true, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would less have to the family five doors.
It's quiet, consuming a little, and above all, it's an impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the damage of then it seemed like the fucking tube was tapped by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all bottles.
We, however, note that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection beginning of 1400 per 329.900 crowns is still possible.
Our associated places it from 410.900 crowns, which is too much.
The type of Premium tested already reaches other 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the heads, autoconditioned air, auto-parabrises, back windows automatically...
I mean, the car, all of it, costs 53⁄900 crowns.
It's very much, but it's related to the plugins of the team in the Fabia and it's going to reach a very similar number.
Now it is only to be decided by which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not integrated in English Schools
In English Schools, children in Eastern Europe are assisted and thus places fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the East Europeans now brings only a series of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of nationals increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of East European children at the British Schools is very well illustrated in the northern Kent city where the conflicts between the nationals and the Slovak migrations begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronches among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has arrived so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was taking a ten-year-old student with a green staff.
In her defence, she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
The police had to act also after an attack of two young girls of age against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls arrested him with racist insults and took him stones.
"When we went home, a boy approached us to the stop of the bus and began to kick us.
When I told him to leave it, he made us the damn to throw us hands and pearls, and then the pantalons down and showed us his back" described another uncomfortable incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the nationals even designated the conflict with the Eastern Europe immigrants as a fight for super-emigration.
The cases mentioned earlier show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite intense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately about 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacuations you can accomplish, if you choose correctly.
Arenous and golden beaches, big oils or a quiet sea like a stone.
Palmers and all included with cameras offering pizzas on the beach, frozen or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and rulet.
On the Caribbean Island, you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful in all the Grand Antilles Islands.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bathroom of the conquist of America.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place that man's eyes have seen.
Habana became a store and a port of charge of the treasures that the Spanish took out of America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American time.
The National Hotel increased at the end of the 20th century.
He commanded him to build one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was about crime in the United States (and therefore) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, games and prostitution.
They were among their guests, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In La Habana there were high buildings, the cars were running by widths that were a symbol of worship in the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a rental in San Francisco de Paula, near La Habana, and in Cojimar had his yat.
In the walls of the Middle Bodeguita, they left their signatures the world's stars of the world of all America's spectacle and politicians.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the Caro Hotel National, cocktails meets it.
And these cars already served in the 1950s, even today, are working on La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat who have come for a long ago have been oxided between these humid and wind salted.
Although La Habana, especially the ancient campy, is deteriorating note, there are no wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings.
Other places are metamorphosed in beautifulness, for example Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much money necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in La Habana but also in Varadero, the coast of Holguin and in islotes such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and which is very valued by the lovers of the railway.
The sugar candle is transported from the large plants to the east road sugar factories in vapor machines or the tricks.
His cars for decades have not been discovered and now are, machines that work, and whose models of brothers in other parts of the world are only located in museums.
Where to go?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe, just remember that in the already mentioned in Hemingway there is a museum that for those who love the writer, they should not stop visiting him.
The valley of Viñales is the most pintorous rico of Cuba to the west of the island.
Excellent vegetation growing in calice rock lands.
Mogotes, calcium pills and rocks of high-scarped rocks in the valley falls, and in their grotes are aclimized beautiful lands which form rocks that hide from the vegetation.
The valley is the place where, probably, the highest quality tobacco is cultivated in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure pure fabrics can be found with its final product.
Maybe someone seems interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was around there.
Trinidad
The old city of aboling that was founded not long after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Slaveness and sugar brought her fame and richness.
The riches became beautiful with constructions in the small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially affected by the French colons arrived later, has just changed in four centuries.
Trinity, between the sea and the sword of Escambray, is so apart that in the past 50th century there was no way to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay outside the rest.
Nothing new was built, and there was nothing destroyed, for everyone was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one afternoon, you deserve the pen to know interesting places in the neighbors around such as the Ancón Plane or the Valley of Sugar Factorys.
the night belongs to the Music House, which with its music encourages the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
A small city at the west end of Cuba, some view it as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is already confirmed by its own way.
The two roads coming from Guantánamo must pass by high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that only knows the action of the man.
This east place in Cuba has been inscribed as the patrimonium of humanity by UNESCO thanks to its intactate nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Colón (in fact it is a cross that comes 100 years later from the ship) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that there is now a hotel with its own name, the mountains can be seen and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, ron, pure, Sierra Maestro, the Bahia of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the Cuba pattern, the Virgin of the Carity of Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, it's better to see it ever.
The alliances are passive in Afghanistan, says the Americans
Small soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO, if the American Defence Minister, Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not result as it was thought, the representatives of the countries in the south of the country coincided in Edimburg (Scotland).
At the same time, as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states discuss plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through their Defence Minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to a greater activity, Great Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authorities of the Afghanistan Government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is pampable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population to start economic and security," the Defence Minister, Des Browne, said to the BBC.
The nineteen percent
The activity of Afghanistan rebels is data of the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year in 27 per cent, and in the province of Helmand up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan whose fourth part is in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, allocations have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of units.
Exactly they ask more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghanistan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete objectives for the future and how we will achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar sense, the OTAN Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
"I am not glad to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have nine hundred soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop said to the Regis Agency in the closure of the meeting of three days with the Japanese government in Tokio.
Who's passive
Among the assistant countries in the past months, the pole of whether all associates have made the maximum in Afghanistan.
By passive, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are located in a area of minimum violence and the needs of fighting there are not as high as in our, south and east of the country," said Gates.
The Sensational Sun magazine, this week called vague to German soldiers.
"Afghanist rebels discover that Germans are dedicated to play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a Charactergraph where the British troop played a rugby party in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech State deserves 84,000 crowns.
The total debt ascended to 842.1.700 million crowns in September.
This year the government planned to provide 159.200 million crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns through the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The State Debt of the Czech Republic increased at the end of September to 842.1.700 million crowns.
In nine months of this year, it increased to 40.200 million crowns.
However, since June, 13,400 million crowns have been decreased.
Today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the status of October principles.
For each check, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the State has been devoted to more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of the next year we could pass the billion crowns to 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between the 90,000 million and the billion crowns," said the iHNed.cz server, the patria Finance economist, David Marek.
Similarly, the Economy of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, also sees: "We could pass the billion during 2009.
Exactly when this will depend on the next budget we have not yet known.
If the situation was seen to change the political scene and the politicians would be delayed, it could be delayed in 2010.
But I don't see that change." he added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and, in particular, comes to the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by money of the treasure, state obligations, direct loans or for example loans of the European Investment.
The internal debt of the state increased from 38.500 million to 719.400 million crowns this year.
The external debt now has grown from 1.700 million crowns to 123.300 million crowns.
The debt of the state negotiable at the end of September contained 803.300 million crowns z from June was reduced to 13.700 million crowns.
The average end of the state debt increased in 6.5 years.
"The total interannual debt of the first to the third quarter creation of 13 per cent which is greatly given as the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a reform of pensions." Pikora commented.
Better than expected
From the 2007 state debt strategy and management strategy, the Government planned this year to provide 159.200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns through the improvement of the development of the state budget.
The amount is, in particular, composed of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be of 76 million crowns instead of the 91.300 million crowns.
The rest consists of the maximum resources scheduled for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13.300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payment, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.800 million crowns in payments for European investment loans.
He compared today before a court to Jartúm for giving a name to a peuche boss
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court of Jartúm to 15 days of prison and exemption, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of abandoning students from 6 to 7 years of age to give Mahomet the name to a peached bone when every representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was passible for a latiga's pen.
This 54-year British school teacher, depending on the University High School of Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday in her home and committed to Islam and se, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, due to several complaints of student parents in the Southern Ministry of Education.
The story is actually resumed in September, when this teacher asks his students, of 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the class's peach bone.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," accounts the director of the Robert Boulos School.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bone with the following legend " My name is Mohamed ".
The bone he - he himself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Giiyaan Gibbons, professor at the same school in Sudan, needed that she knew well and that she would never have done something that could be insultant to a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that she asked the children to vote for a name ", it is only he's a " innocent error."
The opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who described it as " very attention to their students " and " that never speaks of religion in class ".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, which is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslims is a way of honoring the prophet (frequently given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that meet the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a player?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached a agreement on the future status of the province on midnight during the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
Serbia and the Albanians of Kosovo ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regretable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status, " stated the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlineing that peace in the region was "in game", his American homologer, Frank Wisner, encouraged and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
" We do not predict violence for now but we enter in a very difficult period, " added, pointing out that " evident pressures exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troice, which reacts to the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last a month in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the pob's province to 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will take their relationship with the United Nations Security Council from here to December 10th.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth session and last negotiations since the trick has been charged by a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
And Europeans and Europeans consider that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the concession of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on a persecution of negotiations beyond this date.
"The Russia was and was committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the United Nations of Kosovo, the ONGs consider that the independentity under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to announce it in a single way if the Security Council does not solve it in its favour.
It insists on an increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found ", announced by the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fat日 Sejdiu, at the Baden Hotel, where these " negotiations were held since Monday."
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of its burdens.
But he added that the autonomy plan submitted by "pertained to a past that led to murder and deportation".
" Effect dominated "
The Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered that a commitment was always fair, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral announcement of the independence of the province.
It says particularly to fear a " dominated effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "it doesn't mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision belongs to the Security Council, in which its Russian alia has a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia " had declared the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have spent two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council. "
The journalists, Fat日 Sedjiu had replied that " Kosovo Parliament had the last word on the status " and added that any unilateral statement of independence from the Albanian would be made " in concertation " with the O».
Bush starts an agreement between Israelites and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference held by himself on Tuesday to Maryland, that the Israelites and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a common statement.
He needed that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to establish negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of 60-year-old litigant point between his two people.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a "pay treatment" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle " the terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end their colonization activities, Bush declared, reminding both of their obligations regarding the peace-making itarian in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, presided by Abbas, " would " conclude a peace Treaty that would solve all issues, without prejudice, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main problems of the painful point between the Israelites and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the happiness of the arabic re-emised homes during the conflict of 1948.
Taking the word after the American President, Abbas insisted that the coming negotiations be "global and advanced" and mentioned in all aspects of a regulation, quoting " Jerusalem, re-enters, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
By turning back to the court, Olmert committed the future negotiations to be "direct and continuous" and "a efforts to conclude them in 2008".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the end of its " vision of two states " of Palestinian and Israeli.
Saudi Arabia revealed that he had achieved an emphasis in this sense of Bush before he decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endowed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange of their retraction from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Jerusalem of East.
“A comparison point in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is attacked on the roots of the conflict and its central aspects”, Prince Saoud considers in its arabic periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police is not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Like each time in this type of events, official versions and sounds are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
The first elements of the investigation of the French National Police General Inspection (IGPN), a police car was on Sunday, shortly after the 17th street Luisa-Miguel, Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was at 40-50 km/h, without turning, " explains a police source.

The judge three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, to know that this minimum cycle was quickly reached to its left. "
Yesterday, a kind of ranure, without doubt provoked by the floating of the calzapies on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been packed up the time so that the car of the police could be broken.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical research.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsed yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a voice was quickly by Villiers-le-Bel, if it would have been the police who would have gone very quickly from the site, not by giving the help of both young people.
The IGPN, being aware of it, would also separate " any serious failure " with regard to this point.
"It is the aspect of the most difficult research, which needs more research, which must be very dealing with, " needed a police source.
Liberation found a ocular test of these instinctives who have followed the accident.
One of your windows that exactly give the scene.
"Let us subsequently down, with my firstborn who would be in the hospital, to reanimate them, account this testimony.

This estimate takes into account not desired pregnancy (24%) as well as badly planned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of each three (36%) is not expected, a study conducted by the National Demography Institute (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuvirth law which is liberalial; contraception in France.
This estimate takes into account not desired pregnancy (24%) as well as badly planned or unexpected births.
Different contraception methods such as pile or sterilet are still a failure of 5% to 6%, estimated in Ined.
The liberalisation of the contraception, however, allowed a better " dominion of fatigue ", is the institution that notes that the use of the pill between women from 20 to 44 years has passed from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births of each ten would be well planned today.

spectacular reparation on the space station
It will have lacked more than seven hours of work in the space at astronauta Scott Parazynski and its grouping companions of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular reparation of a discharged and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the citizenial activities of the station.
A risked output that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, from the speed it has been imagined, "chapuced" instruments by the astronautes to perform the reparation.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronautes had released from the lanceer Discovery, the Harmony module, a cilindric cyclinding part responsible for soon to accept European and Japanese scientists (see annex).
This module is a type of landscape for laboratorium modules.
But it must be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the group was to move a power production module with solar panels weighting 17,5 tonnes, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After it has moved, the grouping begins to reorganize solar panels of the module with a 76-metric envelope.
And it's where one of the panels, which are expanded as awardeons, has been hurt in a little bit or less than one meter by a cable that has been attached.
The switch has been stopped to not hurt the panel anymore.
The astronautes, who were at the beginning to perform a control output from the Discovery lance, and then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to carculate at the end of the 30 meters length of the teledirected arm of the lanzader added to the station to perform the reparation.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of Nasa.
High, resistant, very furious, has the very developed torso and the long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the solar panel "wound".
After inspecting exactly the damage, he sealed the fatal cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped the second " spacewalker " that had stayed near the air lock and, inside, by other astronautes such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the group.
The tool that uses, a hokey minibaston enveloped with isolator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundreds of turns, has been designed and "chapuced" by the astronautes at the station board.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely exposed before making the inventary of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had benefited from a midday of rest before today, seven astronautes returned from the Discovery lanceer to return to the Planet on Wednesday.
The EADS Title sanctions in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently decreased to the Paris Board, after the group of Nautic and Defence has announced that it will have to spen between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros in the Paris Board.
The group has been binding to review its prevision of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays of the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which occurs to the inevitable flight of the plane.
The cost of palling the delay taken in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus ", announced the European EADS builder's mother house.
As a result of these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday next, adds no more encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It is necessary to remember that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the delays of another programme, the very rough carrier A380.
Initially, the group predicted a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, on the outcome of the urnes: the Russians will choose greatly for the party of President Poutine, United Russia.
Confirming its encouragement to stability, including the author, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian president Vladimir Putin now directs a television message to the electors on public chains, already registered but whose content is stored secretly.
It makes it as a leader of the list for the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealing.
Yesterday, the president did not allow anything to be transparency by receiving foreign ambassadors, he is pleased to deliver a new burden against the O'e accused of inheritance - his preliminary theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents," he added.
If the opposition is, we're very far from the truth.
Declare a campaign missing by pressures.
The Communist Leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there are "never had so swimming elections, even at the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of the manifestations of the last weekend, the former campaign in the world of Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, is visited by his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
After these legislative elections without surprise, two more open questions are profiled:
Who will happen to Poutine at the president?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first return of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have to be informed until 23 December.
Selected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consequent mandate.
Then no successor comes.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the majority of the parliamentary and of the very powerful Russian party that would choose the Government and the President?
Whatever, in legislative elections such as presidential elections, the outcome power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the soviet homo, they do not feel owners of their destination, " recalls the socialist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
History Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of San Petersburg, is remote: the civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the spirit of the community delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a parental State, perfectly accepted by the population because this new patriarch has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disadvantage, " said Mary Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " reject themselves to personal responsibility " who had shortly proved after the URSS extension.
"What to reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social lines, including the world of matters.
And the administrative eleite thinks to preserve the status quo: 65 rulers (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
The newly imported freedoms of the O©e are often synonyms of chaos, such as in the 90s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of that the Russians will not vote either for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year age professor: "Why to reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why are they changed? "
A hard memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi files of Bad Arolsen, which described the destinations of 17,5 million victims of the hitlerian regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of stalleniers at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not advisable until here only at the end of the "human", namely in individual and nominative way, at the request of an ancient victim or of their rights.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the searchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement has been completed by all States, opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historicals to Bad Arolsen will allow " particularly on the movements of prisoners, the population of fields and the health status of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, director of these files managed by the International Red Commission (CCR).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to opening the public of these nominative documents due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the assumed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain deportation victims.
The records of the concentration fields or detention orders established by the Gestapo have been gathered after war at a practical end: find the deported or subject to the mandatory work farmers and, eventually, provide a test of their intervention in order to open the road to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent salariants are treating tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientist community, access to Bad Arolsen revises a limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz in 2006, director of the Antisemitism Centre at the Technische University of Berlin.

Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, needed the European Commissioner. The Asian and European gigantians change annually by " 47 billion euros" and "10 billion euros of services" said this week, Daniele ́Adja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that the bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential."

UMP and NC parties refuse to review the proposals of the PS party on acquisition power
The UMP group and the New Centre refused to discuss articles of the proposal of socialist law on acquisitive power, which is equal to a depreciation of the text.
Inscribed in a "nick" socialist (the session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a decade of measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the increase of 50% of the surface for employment, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products), a fleeting check-transfer or restrictions for winners.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was raised at the end of the general debate that has been made to trade, sometimes alive, between the majority and the opposition at some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on the acquisitive power.
The leader of the Members of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that its group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft rectificative finance law which was examined by the A.A. in the next week.

Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to draw Hollywood film plates to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator is opposed to that...
This delegated mission is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, declares the "rowaway productions".
Is it difficult to competite with the "Governator"?
"I have to be else, it's the industry who decides where he goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our paper, it is to offer those who will judge the best, " says.
The road to the festivals
At present, Denis Turcotte's priority is, despite the promotion of the film here.
The Okares' career is started.
All the festivals of the Coast O, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present cheese films, to give them value and to ensure that performers are interviewed.

Will you have an end of a year in ball? Experts divided by the 'subpresse' crisis.
Unless of five weeks to dismiss the closure of the exercise, investors are already breaking their hands expecting the traditional rally end of the year.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "after the statistical point of view, in December, often have a positive behaviour.
However, basic provisions should not be made in statistics, even because in the current context, uncertainties are accepted in the markets at least in the short term."
Although they are not partitaries that the road box in the last weeks of the year, these experts point to "the bursat market is supported by the existence of liquidity, intended to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed rent, affected by the effect of escape to quality values both in long and short traces".
Therefore, they believe that the ball will have a better side behavior, not excluding volatility "for all because the impact of the Fed types' decline is not known, given the high level of crude and the risk of stimulating inflationist pressures."
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, matches that it's not a good time to adventure to say that it's going to be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert assures.
Ibex has lost approximately 4% from the maximum marked on 8 November when he closed at 15,945,7 points.
Still, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyz of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearest than 16,000 points thanks to the reactivation of portfolio and traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year at these dates.
However, the expert murmures that things will be something different this year since he thinks that the rally will progress in the second week of December, after the Constitution's bridge.
The analysis does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analysis of Inversis Bank, appreciates that we are near technical levels and that we could "see a reboot of the potential that could be impulsed depending on the news that comes from the United States on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analysis believes that these are positive.
The analystes agree with the time to choose the values that will be responsible for carrying Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, of Intermoney, that "this year touchs the great values."
The expert would include the two large constructions and some builders in the wallet "when the date comes, the sector will be very deep."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank, assures that upcomes will come from the hand of the industry and industry.
Constructors may also benefit from this rally, if they are given.
"Acs takes several months recovering positions and we expect other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own way," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales at the season of maritime sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do it very well, even though there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times December has been a month baptized.
The authentic end-year rally lived in 2003, the exercise in which bursatile markets came out of the crisis caused by the penching of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a reference of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth year of profits (for the time Ibex is up to 8.36% from January) and if it can be able to account with its end-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew a lot of their offices.
Total 200 in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max Mark, represent a great change for him.
Also for the rest of the Spanish, since it is the first group that is determined to switch into the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30 a.m., and open the 10-hour saturdays to 20:30 a.m.
Another group that has also repeated at several times who wanted to expand their offices' hours, BBVA, has not yet been decided to take steps.
Meanwhile, it is prepared to conclude an agreement with the universities to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange of opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive in order to indicate whether other initiatives are pointed to this initiative in the periods of trade.
Exactly this is the goal that follows Popularity with the project.
Capture the customers who move through these areas to purchase their purchases, pymes, autonomes and trades from the selected streets to open.
It wants to have these 200 open offices in all Spain in about 18 months, because they are not new openings but removing existing.
For this purpose, the employment will modernize the branches you already have in trade areas, adapting them to the profile presenting customers from the different streets.
In this way, the enlargement of timers is accompanied by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more current design with more colorful colors.
Angel Rivera, trade responsibility, assures that this reaction does not constitute a great investment, even though a greater staff contract, since there is about six employees at eight or nine.
The offices, which will even count spaces so that pymes can be gathered there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience was positive, explained by Angel Rivero.
The Bravo Murillo Street Offices, O'Don and Gran Via de Madrid have been selected, and it seems to be accurately, see severo.
Popular account currently with 2.500 branches.
And other 60 operating under the Worldocredit mark, specialised in immigrants, also with very large hours, which even open on Sundays and Festivals.
In these places of PopularMax, they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices are counted with a large abanic of non-financial products for their sale.
'We don't want to competite our customers', says Rivero.
Currently, they have reached an agreement with Telephone to sell mobile, with external personnel to the air.
Double telecinco for the first time the value in Boulsa of its Rival Antena 3
We've done it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday, Paolo Vasile, delegated adviser of Telecinco, at the end of the market, when he found that the chain leading was duplicating the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect emphasized his joy: 'is what I am pained, not because we have grown more, but because we have layer down', he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'We fell less'.
Final Telecinco yesterday with a progress of 2.54%.
That winning is the loss of 15,66% of our years.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) is thus achieved by 4.488.88 million euros, Bloomberg data.
Its Antena rival 3, which yesterday passed a 1.52% and collected a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs the half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other quoted communication companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Prisa (five days editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
If Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to that we are talking about two similar companies.
The related fact is how we are to do, on the same market, what cost and how we make it rental in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced the last week that it was intended to become this year in the first television chain in over 1,000 million brutal public incomes, Giuseppe Tringali, delegated adviser in Telecinco and Publisca, the branch managing the publicity of the group.
In order to make this announced data real, the TV chain would register this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its publicity facturation for 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise.
In its part, the net facturation of Antena 3 increased 1.6% in the first nine months of exercise (to reach 4.4 million) while the net television income increased 0.7% (63.4 million).
One of the factors pointing to the analysis for the best related development in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high payout that he has maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alejandro Echevarria shared 100% of the benefit among its ιeaists.
Vasile assures that, although it's ready to make the decision, this could vary after the purchase of 33% endmol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be happy to our architects, whom we have already given value to 33% of the endmol'.
Analysts are set up, the market shows at the moments of a certain deficiency.

The harmonised IPC increases five decades in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to include it in the estimate of inflation in the European Union, provides a progress in how the prices in Spain have developed during November.
Its publication is responsible for the Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide equitable data on time and quality to producers in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employer for the Harmonized Consumer Prices Index, but using several statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only orientable, so it does not need to match the definitive data, which will be known on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at high levels"
The second President and Minister of Economics, Peter Solbes, said that the increase in 4.1% of the IPC in November was a "temporary number", but at the same time, the price will continue at "relatedly high" levels in the next months.
In any case, Solbes has punished in the congress passports that "although the number is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation in relation to the monetary union remains the same in the last years.
He also explained that in November it was "learer surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high surprise.
"We were waiting for a number around to 4%," the Minister of Economics has recognized the progressed data today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen over 50% to 12.000 million euros (16.800 million euros) since he entered into crisis in September mid-September and had to recover to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, a number of depths was recorded over 25,000 billion pounds, which has progressively fallen in two and a half months by the disloyalty of their customers, and despite the guarantee of the hundred per cent of the money offered by the Government and that will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename it with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to take back to a fourth part of the income in the British income in the next three years to achieve the remaining 18,000 million dollars until it reaches the goal of 30,000 million.
The major Richard Branson group, known by its calling public campaigns in the United Kingdom, aims to spending 50 million pounds annually (approximately 70 million euros) in publicity and market technology to achieve their purpose.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of Virgin's consortium, in which other three companies participate, as their favorite to save it from the road.
Totana's colleague stopped by the present urbanism corruption tragedy
The Civil Guard has arrested this morning at the current holiday of the Totana Municipal Municipality (the Popular Party) for its presumptuous relationship with the tragedy of urbanism corruption this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretariats of the Constitute and the police officer of the municipality has been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo substituted the last May to Juan Morales, the current popular member, and even then the government of the municipality, and that sources of research consulted by the SER Cadena could be the 'head' of this tragedy.
Agencies continue to register municipal dependences and Urbanism advice and do not leave any detentions in the next hours.
Moreover, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspicious of the tragedy of urbanism corruption at the beginning of this week, has been imposed.
Like yesterday the SER Cadena reported to the lawyer of the lawyer Juan Morales, therefore, was stopped to exit from the home of Morales with important documentation related to the trame.
Moreover, the subject of research, which is sources of research, is the assumed cover of Morales committees to facilitate the signature of a urbanist convention with a galean building company in order to recalculate 200 hectares of terrain.
For the moment, there are eight persons arrested.
Bono accepts to head the PSOE candidature by Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the
The former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the case that socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of the PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the midday that has held this party at the federal office of this party with Zapater.
The Executive Boss has justified the offer to the former minister because "the best" in the political life and "the best" is "the best".
Furthermore, he pointed out that "yes" seems to be the candidate of the socialist group to preside the Congress if socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would substitute as President of the Congress to Manuel Marin, who published last 15 November its decision to not present to the next general elections and to abandon its career in the active policy to devote himself to fight climate change in the university.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he returns to the political vanguard since he has abandoned it two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, as the citizens know who the economic President would be if the PSOE won elections, its party wanted to announce who the Congress would be president in a "transparency Act".
If the charge reaches, Bono expects to convert the Chamber into "the house of respect and not the insult or crying". And to make "seems more like the citizens".
"Please regret it seems that the only local in Madrid where it is not possible to speak quietly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the Government at some time was interrupted 26 times in the Senate."
He also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marin and "he's good work" and did not want to see her position again to not fall in what, it has been noted, his opposers could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate changes is inevitable to persecute both the skeptics of their predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is required to demonstrate iron coherence.
And another leader of the movement that is the president of the Government as Zapater and believes that this fight is more important than the islamic terrorism and is even proposed to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach requires you to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government, has contributed decisively to the incomplete of the EU in Spain.
Who are responsible for the failure, in which sectors has been produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Furthermore, it requires you to explain with the highest clarity to the Spanish which are the measures to take to prevent climate changes.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective energy advantages we will be binding to do, what economic consequences it will have.
Anyway, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there will not be any of these explanations.
That's exactly because it's about sacrificating and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are improper.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the center of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapater that he has been quick to refuse it.
That is, that it is to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impacting phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that lord is so useful for electoral campaigns that doesn't speak or deny or require, but he adheres mytines and inspires tenderness.
Every time it is limited to be a contracting part only and it does not want us to move into a bicycle or refresh us with the abbanic.
Detained by the boss and head of the local police of Totana by a presumed broadcast of urbanism corruption
The Civil Guarantee has arrested the officer of Totana's mursian locality, the "ar" José Martínez Andreo, the leader of the local police, the secretariat of the Ayuntament and a hostal business for possible urbanism crimes, have reported sources of research today.
The edge was arrested at its home and has been arrested after the Consequence, in which the dependencies are at the moments with many agents, who have also accused the Urbanism Conceal and the municipal management company of the Industrial Suelo and Life.
These three detentions are summarized to the six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in a operation related to the recycling of more than 2 million hectares of rustic ground in urbanizable so that the Galle Nuaria company builds 4.000 residences after the payment of illegal commitments during the past legislation.
Furthermore, two other people were not arrested but are imputed in the summary, which instructs the Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six prisoners have passed to the court today.
The sources have been informed, the former Totana director and today the autonomous parliamentary of the PP, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
Furthermore, the former woman, the property of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as the current girl of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Paul José M.G., director of Sweelo de Inmonuar, agency integrated in the said Group, and to which the subors would have been carried out.
The investigation runs by the Urbanist crimes Group of the Operative Central Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guarantee, whose agents, as well as arrests, practiced eleven registers, the majority of companies related to detained and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Roses (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a very known bird-product company in the region, which could have acted as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the greatest residential complement of Totana's mursian municipality, which would assume the construction of more than 5.000 residents, a golf field and two hotels with "spa".
The company purchased 2,2 million square metres of land that were recalified in Totana and its project would have to duplicate the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to immobiliary promotion; Conycase, which manages the vigourous parkings of the Coruña Streets, Venezuela and the Fernando Catholic place; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconize, focused on promotion, sale and installation of elements of construction.

Our Finnish composer facilitates this comment from yesterday in the most important period of Finland (for example, in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day in which it appeared, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the signature of the Philosophia has gone to the public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela School.
The guilty of death, a bachillerate student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser responsible for the assignment of Philosophia, Pekka Elo, has taken from the pages of Helsingin Sanomat's journal that teachers adopt a criticism towards Platon and suggested that studies to Nietzsche is not impressive in the mandatory obligation course of Filosofia in the institutions."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the criminal code of crimes on the Internet:
A. The song of a song would be crime with six months to one year.
However, if you steal disks for less than 400 euros, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the tent up to 1,000 euros, the currency is already crime, but the penalty remains lower than the tax (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the pen continues to be lower than the of the (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the compact exchange.
Participation in a tumultuous renal has three months a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual accusation in the work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie, is found in Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authorisation is more punished than the distribution of pornography material to smaller (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague's in the truth, someone's going hand, a very long hand.

My head-up doctor takes me away one of your articles on rare investigations entitled "The money produces brain activations, especially if the others receive less."
I mean, the feelings that generate the payment of the workers depend on what the companions win.
The study has been conducted through magnetic reasons at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
See Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
Researchers noted that if when both of them had received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if so much science would require this conclusion.
Balkan fiscal
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years by providing an intervention to the Balkan war criminals since the criminal court's fiscality for the former Yugoslavia, located in Haya.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with a landscape, because the main responsible for the killing of Srebrenica - in which 8000 Muslim bosniums died -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbish leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be free.
His names are on that list of which the documentation of the executor of his Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla' (2006, not trained in Spain), which, with the time of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss tax in New York to guard the fugitives and press the governments involved to stretch the circle.
What assurance do I have?
The car insurance, which covers the driver from possible deficiencies, provides an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as the age, the sex, the anti-eight of the sheep, the civil state, the type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Keep the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialized in a contract of insurance, which provides that the company receives the value of the first agreed in order to be responsible for the obligation of paying compensations in case of insult.
The primary is the price of the insurance, which is set out taking into account various factors such as age, sex, anti-eight of the sheep, civil state, type of vehicle to ensure or use that it is to be used, among others.
Insured companies set their prices depending on statistics, so most likely to suffer an accident, more than abonnament.
It is therefore why both older than 25 and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics reflect that they have a smaller disabilities due to their existence.
Furthermore, by putting out the accounts, companies have concluded that married people have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percency.
Increasing frequency increases the probabilities.
There are many variables that the guaranteers have to take into account at the time of setting the price of the prize.
It is therefore that the driver must well study the situation to choose the car assurance that is better adapted to his profile.
We will explain the most significant variables here at the time of choosing one or other type of insurance, so that you, besides adapting to the features of the insurance, offer you a reasonable price.
Youths less than 25 years are inconvenient at the time of achieving a safe price, such as the reduced experience in conduct and the anti-equity of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well assured is a security for any risk, there are other economically more options.
The most careful drivers can choose for a whole risk of fraction, so they get the coverages of an insurance to any risk but to a more fair price.
This type of conviction would assume that the customer pays a part of the sum of the teacher.
"The part of the sum of the client's amount will be established depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher as lower the amount," indicates Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain de First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an enlarged security for third parties, so that the customer is ensuring protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to the caused in his own car.
Furthermore, it would be robbed, burned and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are less than 25 years old, be careful and avoid disturbance as soon as possible, because this will affect bonification, reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonification is a reduction on the basic tariff that the company owns.
In contrast, a penalisation is a recharge on that basic tariff.
"The bonifications and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has been a good year, the bonifications may be allowed to increase," Noguera states.
In the past of 25 years, the drivers have easierly contracted an insurance, since the disabilities are reduced by the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommendable is to contract a whole risk of frankness.
"Normally youths cannot use the experience previously purchased at the time of a accident, even at the time of conduct," assures the director of the European Company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents are occurred in the second year of conduct, once the 'media of the news' past.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children, it is preferable to negotiate a security for any risk, even when its economic situation is allowed, it is clear.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered as assurances as the public with less disabilities, so recharges will be less.
In this case, the best insurance would be one to any risk of frankness (which may be EUR 300), or, when there is a high level of bonification, one to thirds extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They are conducting a more relaxed conduct and have a greater acquisitive power to allow the luxe to assume a greater quantity of frankness," Judge Luis Noguera.
For the convictions, an insurance is recommended for any frequency risk (which is 150 euros), or one to thirds extended when a high level of bonification is made.
It is necessary to say that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver with the potential deficiencies, but also because it represents an important expenditure, for which it is essential to study the assurance that more convinces us is our personal situation.
Celtic seeks Milan a point worth the octaves
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they miss to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions liquor, since the Italians serve to be first and to the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians summon ten points and have already certified their pass on the fifth day with a empath in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfa, who has four, not forward.
These two games of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to dispute with the World of Clubs in Japan, where it is held on Thursday 13 in half-finals in search for a place for the end of 16th.
So this group will be closed before the rest and empathy in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out by a victory, since the Italians won't want to speculate at home, and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in eight.
For a lot of Gordon Strachan, it could even serve a damage to classify whether Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because the pass is equal to nine points for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won (2-0) in the other direct pleasure.
Thus, the Millennists will try to worm the Schools night, confident that they will be set in eighth per second time in the Champions League repository and in consequent way, after exactly breaking the past campaign with a Kaka gol in the prolongation (1-0) after 0-0 of the ida.
Waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, if the Celtic loses, to be set in eight and to follow the EUFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being the last and without options to follow the maximum European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, which would be the EUFA.
20,000 people attend Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before approximately 200,000 spectators, their first turn since they were solved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) have stated a little before they start their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the group' is 'brillant'.
Approximately 20 000 people had the entries to present the concert that included a video in which the story of the group was reported at the end of 1990s.
The recycling and the global tour matches the adoption of a new album that collects its main success and two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Vodoo', published in Spain.
The five Spice Girls' integrants went out to the scenario by lighting some bracelets that the husband of Posh Spice, the British footballist David Beckham had given to them.
The sporter was among the public that was aborted by the GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had made it days ago.
In the preview of the start of the spectacle, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astrologer "he has not seen our clothes for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the spectacle."
"Sporty Spice" whose output from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the solution of the fifty two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the spectacle beginning.
"It was the girls.
I was nervous but I saw the world's feeling has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I am happy to have taken the decision," Chisholm said about the group she solved nine years ago.
The song also pointed out that with time, "the things have been corrected and we love all of us."
But many things have changed since Spice Girl's last acted together in 1998.
For the first time, the CTV television came to Vancouver in a special flight of Virgin Airlines.
When he arrived to the port, he expected a kids' army to them.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They shall act in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears of gas between Russia and Ukraine
The increased dispute on the gas price between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of exporting fuel to Western Europe from Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is addressed to Ukraine, so each rock among both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous discussion last year reduced the supply to the EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, Gazprom, monopolic owner of gas, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would cover more Ukraine, since it has been committed to pay a additional 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from the neighbourhood Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine may pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the conversations," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinakh to the news agency Re.
"The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
The last large dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This means a fall in exports to Western Europe, which was quickly up to prices.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a lot of it is still not completely developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with the gas of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS " must test foreign workers"
The Swedish NHS needs to control the criminal antecedent records of employees outside Europe, said a supervisory.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black vino after checking that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on the Glasgow port in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scotland NHS has no exact idea of the quantity of foreign staff with which it relates.
However, its report noted other controls that were correctly carried out to a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the amount of foreign staff contracted outside the European Economic Area, based on the attacks on the Glasgow port.
Bilal Abdullah, 28th, a Iraqian Hospital Royal Alexandra de Paisley, was arrested in the port after shopping a jeep at the doors of the terminal building of the port.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of the suspects attacked with a car bomb in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks to candidates to ensure that they comply with qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health assembly uses "Disclosure" to carry out criminal anticipation controls, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information out of Britain.
The report of the General Auditor recommends, inter alia, that the meetings should comply with the Guide of Crime Records Bureau, which helps employees with criminal controls in many countries outside the United Kingdom.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine revision," says the report.
Black states that the Scotland NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but it notes: "Our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that the information needed in the number of NHS foreign staff is available."
President of the BMA, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "very small" that pre-employment checks could identify NHS employees potential that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS, but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations were made," explained.
The Swedish health authorities declare that they currently have 1.161 foreign people, most of them doctors and medicals
However, the general auditor warned that the number could be higher, in part because the assemblies have problems to identify what employees they are with undefined residence authorisations.
The investigation also found that the test procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were broadly fulfilling.
This includes passport controls, work authorisation and qualifications check.
The Swedish Government is currently revising the policy and guide for foreigners' pre-employment in the NHS.
The Health Secretariat, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "It was a great interest to carry out this work based on the terrorist attack of the Glasgow port.
He added that the Swedish Government, together with the health assemblies, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment management guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they had planned to publish the next month.
Joy Division dominates in film premiums
Control, the biography film on the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five premiums at the British Independent China Festival, including the galardon for the best movie.

And Bond's protagonist Daniel ́ig won the premium of varieties for putting a British film on the international scenario.
The premiums were delivered in a ceremonie in London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at 23 years of age.

But also the Netherlands Corbin winner, already known by the Joshua Tree album's chart economy of the U2, galardonated with two premiums - to the best director and best debutant director.
The rock music was the center of another premium in the ceremonie -as Julien Temple's movie on the vocalist of The ́sh Joe Strummer, wined the premium to the best documental.
The premium to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role of chofer of a leader of the Russian mafia in London, in the David Cronenberg Promises of East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation to play hard, received Richard Jarris' premium for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifth, whose movies include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently films the Indiana Jones sequence "The Kingdom of the Cristal Calves".
Winstone said he was proud of receiving that prize, so appointed in honor by Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, dead in 2002.
"They were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was happy to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
The independent cine premiums, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes films, actors and festival organisations.
Simpatients and mechanisms of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Seera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that he arrested 208 military terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks against religious and security forces.
The state TV of the largest oil provider in the world said that one of the cells was planning the contrabanding of missiles.
Al-Qaeda Simpatizens have assembled a campaign against the local monarch, in association with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
A eight-soldate cell formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an oil installation in the East province, stated the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a 35.000 effective force to protect Abqaiq’s installations, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failing attack from Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement of the Ministry of the Saudi Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell leading by a "expert in missile management", which has entered into the country.
The Minister said that the soldiers had planned the entry by contrabanding eight projects to the country.
Other 22 prisoners were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The Government warned the religious leaders who must be more active to stop the Saudi who travel to Iraq to join as military in Al-Qaeda to fight the allied forces and to support the government of Shiita Muslim, which is considered hereafter by the most extreme Saudi Sunes.
Al-Qaeda soldiers have regard to many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policy of the real family, which dominates the government.
The soldiers recluted by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to join the pro-o-e-government of the country - had a goal of residence of strangers associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort for security forces since five months of work," said the carrier of the Ministry of the Interior to State TV.
The arrested also include a 16-medium cell in Medina, whose objective was to promote "the takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the Muslims' radical sounds that support violence against the Muslims considered apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing financial support and support to military soldiers.
The climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have been a proper place for life once, they declared science yesterday.
The data of a European space ship in orbita showed the planet the most like one of the Earth than it had previously been observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and take similar orbits, even though Venus is easily closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had similar conditions to which they made the Earth a living planet, now the sciences believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the inver-effect, the atmosphere erosion by solar radiations and the slowest solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to swim down and is erosioned by the winds and rain storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, who has studied the planet for a year, offer a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes on the basis of climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "Why the climate in Venus is so different from the Earth when two are similar planets.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario where Venus eats as the Earth, perhaps with a living environment for millions of years ago."
Police decome "Ricking Urian"
A kilo of radiactive material, which they declare is enriched uranio, was decommitted yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police carrier declared that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The effective could not confirm whether it was rich uranio but said that it could have been sold for a million dollars (480,000 pounds of sterling).
Still open
Mitt Romney says it is not worth that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow mono.
However, the Republican candidates for the Presidency are eventually accessed to maintain a debate at YouTube, where common and running voters have questions in video and send them to their distribution among candidates.
No of the questions submitted on Wednesday 28 November was more ridiculous than the snow moon who asked democrats about climate heat in the debate of the YouTube Republic party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party to the elections of the next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, co-patrocinating the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest dedicated to one subject, was focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN requested a group of indecisive voters to come up to the dial when they listened to ideas that they would like: the candidates noted little approval when the candidates talked with extremist arguments.
The hardest speech exchanges of the night were given between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioner, and Mr. Romney, which has been pointer to the crucial investigations of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to destroy Romney's reputation because he was mixed with illegal immigration when he was a leader in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former ruler of Massachusetts of contracting illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when they asked if any candidate could support a "amnistie" (to allow illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The smaller candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressor, agreed with the subject.
No one has the word to be appointed as candidate, but both are still in the career because they both warned about the subject of immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates have a view: increased monitoring in frontiers, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This subject, with the fear of toxic players in China and other concerns outside, helps the Republicans to guard, or minimise, divisions between liberals and Christian conservators.
But the debate was uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapons control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the ingression in water should be considered a torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to cross the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonas and the ballen.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the latest investigation of Iowa, thanks to his long-term Christian conservation, said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be favorable, he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent as to be candidate in the elections.
The career is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, consistently with the collection campaigns of the liberal Ron Paul's funding campaigns, and its accurate statements of the debate on Wednesday.
These two have gone out of the fund because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most traditional and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early party and convincedly with a winner message on the size of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from being clear.
Workers Dolores
Gordon Brown has deceived another hole in which he's moving; but it also comes.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It seems not to have been sold influences, nor is it exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor is it cut out of extra marital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has distorted contributions to the English laborist government party, more than 650,000 dollars of sterling (1.3 million dollars), for about four years using names, and that the party has not charged it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister claimed to call for a election, insulting stupidly the British intellectual, stateing that the opinion investigations did not affect its decision, the hope was that a strong and strong government would provide you.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the liberal democracy leads with growing engine, because fearing Mr. Brown has been Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a person in problems, showed regulatory deficiency and poverty of judgment in crisis times.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have made business groups together against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that discovered an unimaginable administrative chappie.
A three of the retraite generals started a motin in the Lores chamber, protesting against courts in military expenditure: being ministers of armed forces is, they claimed, a middle-time employment.
Now they are the multipla donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the worker secretary (and previous complice) has already released.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocablely traveling to the output.
Governments can reach a point of inspection after unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they still suspend their incredulity when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve the things, which has not long been left, that suspension is too much: public officers begin to fail; office ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; the government is putting for defence and is not focused on.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, in contrast with other political leaders, it cannot be defended by argumenting that it is new.
Although I wanted to refuse Tony Blair, he was his superior lawyer.
Northern Rock's problems and authority registration tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as a bug cancer.
And even when it is not directly involved in the contracts of Blairish - or "effective for partners", the research on the financing of political parties - the voters may assume if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The tables are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, nor has been staffed right.
And the medicine, even though painful, is to give what the tendencies of Mr. Brown's natural Stalinists have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity gifts, says that he does not want public recognition for his kindness.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't take it.
The laws against the anonimation for the large political contributors are clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know about Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously be Jon Mendlesohn, the chief of funding who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not yet involved: there is nothing that he would suggest that he knew of these actions, although the payment's hazard was made after he took control of the office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the work until now.
It has been quick to condemn its party for violation of the law, but it is diluted in making decisions for a family matter, a research committee on the matter - conducted, in good manner, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morality is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a case of the police.
Moreover, there are other things Mr Brown must do, like to find a permanent and independent leader for the Committee on Normas in the Public Life, because he has not had one since six months, and he must also be pressed by a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a strong cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and maybe a refusal to the special financial situation with the syndicates - you need measures for a party like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisting facts.
Conservators now have a good level of support in the investigations; he has two years to win voters; and the only way to move to the victory is to act with an impecable probability and strong competition.
Tiburone cards
The crisis of the hypothics subscribes is infecting the American market for credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some backshales are not excited around.
Today, since the American residence market is in crisis, depreciators have their views on the market in the country of credit cards.
The Goldman Sachs analystes calculate that losses in credit cards can reach 99 million dollars if the hypothecase crisis affects other forms of consumption credits.
Account signs are already seen.
There is a increase both in card charges and crime rates that measure the proportion of saldes that have not been amorted or who have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that he took 1.4 million charges in its financing business to the American consumer, in part due to the deficiency of card providers.
However, it's very early for the panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a classification agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point under the historical average.
The deterioration in taxes can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American person's cheap law (2005) took place a brush falling in the cheap applications, which at the same time represents a huge loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, morosity) would be growing again, or may occur that the conditions for the providers were deteriorating.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much its debts pay consumers each month.
And confidence in credit cards and values supported by assets is quite strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a signature investigation. It foretells that emission volumes for 2007 will be nearly 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection channels of the crisis between the hypothics and the credit card market are certainly available: consumers like to load debts to credit cards now that credit cards are expiring.
However, the credit card holders view the liquidity flow more than the active values, so the falling prices do not necessarily make a change in the capacity credited by the providers.
You can even work to promote the people.
The incentives for consumers to continue deteriorating the hypoteque decrease whether properties are less value than the loan value; and as a result, the debt payment of the card is up in the list of priorities.
Card holders may also respond quickly and flexiblely to the difficult conditions that hypoteca providers, change interest rates or change creditors sales.
This in theory should reduce the risk of rapid retassing of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and evaluate all loans again," says Gary Perlin, Capital One Finance Chief.
If a sudden infection of the subtract on the credit cards market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable decrease are much more real.
If the house prices are lower and a credit contraction is empowered to America to the recession, the indud industry will have a more severe future.
We need to keep watching those backshales.
British bankers declared guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were judged for their responsibility in frauds with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocents of seven fraud charges for cold with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves near the employees.
They were sent to judgment in January.
But during the audience before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. , each one was sentenced as a guilty collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, one of the Scotch group of PLC in the Royal Bank, became famous in Greenwich Natwest for the extra procedures for two years.
In the United States, its case marks the end of an investigation launched after Enron's breakdown in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were to have warned Fastow in 2002 that it was a goal of a government investigation on Enron's fall.
The accusation against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - states that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a company of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the artist of a thousand frauds in Enron, which helped his breast-feeding spirit.
In 2002, the value of the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that it would be valuable.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
The accusation is held, Fastow represented Enron, because the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers covered 7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced by two conspiracy charges in Enron's colapse.
The British triumph was arrested three months later.
Fastow is being executing a 6-year trial in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is carrying out a 3-year-old penny and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, declared in a road in December 2001 after years of tricks in accountability, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business failing successful.
The colapse has made thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive boss, Jeffrey Skilling was charged for the last year by his roles in the colapse of the company.
Skilling is fulfilling a condemnation of more than 24 years.
Lay's condemnation for conspiration, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died from an attack on the heart last year.
Down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to flight directly from Moscue to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expenditure for some of the Russian rich.
"He has the capacity of up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks that model of so many sits because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was responsible for the Gulfstream Cabine on Wednesday in the Millionary Festival, a four-day consumption orgy celebrated in a center of events in the neighborhood of the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, other 200 luxe providers had installed their exhibition stands, expecting to attach new Russians addicted to any kind of products, from the artesoned yachts in caoba to the incrossed car pairs of diamonds, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully on an anarranged porsche in the neighborhood stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's a nickle and calderly compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital seems to Dallas when he was in pooge.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some awadowed Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, former teacher of the Davis Centre for the Russian and Eurasian University of Harvard.
"As the Saudians of the 70s and Japanese in the 90s, the Russians are embarrassing as the biggest consumers and expenses of the world."
The most luxe marks in the world are looking for part of the pastel.
In another place of Moscow, this week will be held a conference on the luxo industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the President of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell luxe goods in markets such as Russia.
(The Conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, property of the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 million multi-millioners who make a total of $282 billion, the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, the second-degree riches include 103.000 Russian million people whose money is reached to $670 billion, a study of the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economicists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local thinking of sork.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of the Russians were under the level of sustainance.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and therefore we're all here," says Nicole Marais, representative of sales and marketing of David Morris, the London joyer.
She was sitting at the festival for the first time with the Russian market distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"The women are impec'e prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the festival on Sunday night, dressed at afternoon, two root agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaries.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm going to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design cart that he used as a veteran carpet dishing with Joan Rivers.
The festival aims to attraction the new rich, the type of buyers that would be willing to stay a few hours in a store that mixs marks from Cadillac Scalades, platin cortaplas, frozens of Mövenpick, based pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund tee bones.
The general public can buy 30 euro currencies ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in what mark is most costly and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patrioticly sitting in a stand of the Netherlands' real porcelains Delft, before a wall rebuilding of a painting of burnt, painted blues in hand.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the Russian rich of more traitory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their pleasures from the calling logos to the marks of limited editions, which would not be exposed to a commercial ferry.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people: millionaries in reality, millionaries or tourists are filled every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the festival last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general director of the King Koil beds, said he sold two cocktail systems of $70,000 each, seed, cashmire, and cotton treated with gold shields.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, deserved of sales for A1 Moto, companion who equipped high gamma cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said that the company had sold the anarranged Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian billion.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who changed luxe cars for specific requirements, said he had sold three car pairs in the form of chain bracelets for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000.
He showed to the reporter a car wheel designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrossed rays of Swarovski color cristals, so it was similar to a routine.
The cost: $22,000 for four roads.
"The Russian millionary who wants avestruz skin wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive over these wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of your Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian states that the phrase "Russian millionary" does not mean **e, given the price oil of the immobiliary properties.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionary, at least in the paper if it's not in reality," he said.
"There's more than what you think."
Those who were not millionary could at least be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management signature.
The company made four red phone cabins (britannian style) filled with billet piles of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said that his team had printed 500,000 billets for the Millionary Festival.
The visitors stopped taking money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on a lot of money, or a few million dollars.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionary," Karryev says.
The "chapuza" surgery could be caused by a death in New Jersey
It was the preceding day of Thanksgiving Act when Ronald Livingston looked at the "A little more healthier" window and saw how an ambulance ascended by White Cape Cod, two doors below in West Scott's adventure.
Soon, there appeared a car from the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance up," said Mr. Livingston, Restaurant overseer, that Wednesday.
"This was when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41-year-old, assistant of the Department of Newark Police.
Now researchers are going to determine whether she died because of a non-approval plastic surgeon, which is not yet identified by the police, but works at the Av. West Scott's 212 house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test, even though the results are not available until a few weeks. This will help to solve the mysterious death that you have attracted to the higher rows of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"He was loyal, working and tenaz," Mr. McCarthy said on Arroyo at a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"He was my guard."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former police officer in Newark who worked for the Alcohol Bedroom Control Committee, and left two sons of 14 and 11 years, and a daughter.
Theodore J. Romankow, Eileen Walsh, portfolio of the Union Court fiscal, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died based on an unapproved surgery procedure.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It's a current research."
The authorities said that they arrived in the house nearly 3 P.M.
From 21 November and found Mrs Arroyo in a sofa.
It was declared dead in the place.
He has spent more than one week, and the authorities have little said about their research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro was asked by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine what part of the house was used as medical advice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a marched rosal is located on the front side of the house, and a ladry dall on the back.
A bubble alike tagged as "vainillin ethyl" - used as substitute for food and perfumes - was located at the door of the cotton, at the side of a gate that drives to the sothan.
Two mountain bicycles cut out of hangs on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived to Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of an inestimable help to meet the new island city and its rude political culture.
"He would say, "the tenes to watch with this," said he.
"He was always here when I was, and also when I didn't.
It's pregnant."
It is expected that the Federal Reserve will cover the taxes to rise the Bolsa
The actions hopped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected that the Federal Reserve calms the credit conditions at interest rates, which were increased with the quiet comments of the President of the United States Central Employment.
The balls were located in London, New York and Europe after Donald Kohn, two of Ben Bernanke, the president of the reservation, declared that politicians should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuous pressure of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to satisfy markets in the middle of increased credit patterns, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "in part invested by the improvement in the market at the end of September and in October".
If it continued the trend to be raised, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments under the financial conditions for immobility and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital in the US markets and to make further shorts of the type of interest, to stabilise the credit conditions.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the US economy, such as the sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were emphasized by a warning of Bear Stearns, investment that will cut 650 jobs, which is equal to 4% of its total work, in a global reduction of costs to compensate losses of investments in the US sub-premium hypoteques.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter in London, where he employs 1.500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones ascended to 331 points, or 2.55%, closed to 13.289.40, while the wide S&P 500 increased 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 exceeded 165.5 points, or 2.7%, closed to 6.306.2, adding over 39 billion sterling pounds to the value of British first-order companies.
The German Dax increased 2.6%, and CAC40 of France was over 2.3%.
In the first place, the rearrangement of the credit pressure on the markets was highlighted after a strong request in a summary of funds to three months of the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European trade loans at 4.7%, the highest price since April 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject additional funds on the value markets in London, stressed the loan and loans for three months "Free" between the British, meaning that it was greater since September, 6.59%, after a constant increase from 12 November.
England judges the requests of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each one as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election that is at loan - with at least that particular title, is here to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael V'han, the Captain, to decide; and also because the Hugh Morris' office, director of England, is beginning to fill offers to become a national choice, and if not, in one part of time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth battle place will be unfortunate, but life often is injust and sports are also.
It is not easy to draw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because there is no happiness more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, because judgments are repeated that are always being subjective.
Is the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it just for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be done in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted at the table: there is only a place for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give you the opportunity to swallow or kidnapping to the next chance?
Of course, figures have a great impact on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eyes at the same time to take a "wicket" and a battery to get opportunities to change the order if you want to have effect as player one day.
But capturing the eye of the electors is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison is declared for "fit and good" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 careers for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 in the same average, but both have had their high moments and can wait more than these.
Shah or Bopara games in the stadium of Asgiriya can only be a question of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it may mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, fighting for setting up at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite noting a double hundred against ↓a inside, it can be still subestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, V°han and Moores, after a more discussion at the today's session at the stage of Asgeriya, will follow their conservation instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience on the exhaustity of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, it is a valuable and valuable test of the 88 principles in Bombay, 32 centuries of the first class before only 6 of Bopara, who is in 22 years older, and has excellent advances against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten carriers in his two tours in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his house as Middlesex player, and that caused a immediate Property of the electors when V'han claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" something from him that was in Bombay.
Instead, Essex's team is happy to live in swords.
He was arrested for nothing in the cricket field and his own was resumed as when he flew his vehicle in an exhibition for the English car patrocinator, Volkswagen.
He suffered less important lesions and, probably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his team companion looking at the distance, to say "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is the best player, it includes his steps in bald · to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, because it battles with confidence and ability.
Selecting the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his opportunity, which doesn't mean Shah doesn't surpass, as the tea sheets suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi re-revolutions from Syria began to arrive to Bagdad yesterday, expelled the exiles who remained unreasonable, without visa and those who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some even fled to fight against the military men who brought them out of their homes.
At Mansour's bus station, even before 800 people arrived in a official convoy of the government composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with re-eye of Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah al-Qubasi, Sunite doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the magazines, about what happened in Bagdad and that it's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," said, repeatedly repealing the chic milician of the religious soldier Cle · Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentan cease.
Cassim at Atwani, a 38-year-old chichit and professor in Amariyah's sunit area, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime does not want the Iraqs working in their country.
His chitling neighbors in Amariyah called him on a phone to tell him that an U.S. allied force helped to take Al-Qaeda out of his bastard to the west of the capital, and they urged him to return.
One of the recent arrived in Jordan was the leader of a Sunite and Chit tribe who had been led from his home in Sleikh to the north of Bagdad, by a granate attack, after he urged the citizens to arise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a milician anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my companions."
"I've been back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many have said that they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troops had abroad groups of "citizens concerned" armed and worked in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighbors.
But many have stated that they have been rejected by the refusal of visates and the lack of money in the past years, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi have been established.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old and the father of three children, voted to the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister of Chiche, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions to the visates of the re-made to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled from the country because of the sectoral tables of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving visa to the Iraqs to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunite.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left it."
A part of the reason for ceasing violence is that the sunites have been exhausted from the Chicago and inverse areas, relaxing the pressure.
There is fear that a re-eye of re-eyed oil will bring the sectoral pressures again and start the fight.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in professional training and even through the international orientation of its high schools.
Like in the whole country, Sarlandians are only missing a educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for fifty times to a non-Sarlandian who we are not French," that was the ironic moto on himself of the smallest federal state for his fifty.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system that in a study of the German Economic Institute (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" the fifth place.
In this way, higher traditional schools have a good relationship with neighborhood countries.
The Saarbrücken university was founded in 1948 by the French.
Even today, students can finish their university career with two or three diplomas.
Therefore, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15,6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them have not a library.
"In Sarre, the professional education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Economic Institute (IW).
More than five young people make their bachillerate at the Professional School. This results that the Sarre is 7% above the national average.
In contrast, the variety of opportunities for a professional-academic education is very large.
The offer of double careers, related to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and a growing demand, the number of engineering entitled in Sciences has fallen a third in the last years.
That was why the Sarre Ministry of Education obligated high schools to make more public for specialities in Engineering Sciences.
" After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms at the general education schools," a portfolio of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order that children start as long as before studying the last year of the project called Kita-Jahr, this does not have any cost, while this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
The 2003 PISA report has been decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But generally, Sarre did not improve much as other federal states.
In Baviera, students can calculate better.
In spite of the Sarlandians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandians are not French, the language of neighbors is a mandatory assignment in the Secondary Teaching Institutes.
Crazy changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela, there will be another hour-life different than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez allows the time in South America to change the time in the mid-hour hour.
Now Chavez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As the Venezuelan State official Bulletin has informed, if the new law is held, the time will be at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time-life that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies its decision saying that the United States will impose the obligation to the world on their day by changing a full hour.
Moreover, Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breaking of relations with its neighborland Colombia because of the action with rehenes.
Left nationalist said that he would not keep any relationship with the head of the State or with the Colombian Government until the conservator Alvaro Uribe continues to be the President of Colombia.
"My dignity doesn't allow me to do this," Chavez says, which is providing a constitutional reform where the citizens of the Oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be fully expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by repealing Chavez ' s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist warrile in which the release of rehens was taken.
On Sunday Chavez said criticizing that the decision that Uribe took has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you relax?", is the phrase that have already been a half million people.
This phrase stated by the King of Spain that he felt disappointed by the continuous interruptions by the Left Populists in the last Ibero-American Cumber.
In 2007, the decrease of the real salary threatened Germans.
It is a predict that this year a decrease of the real salary threatens German employees despite a strong coy.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimist predict.
In accordance with the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should account in 2007 with a real salary lower than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak development of the salaries, the increase of the tax on the added value and the steel of the prices of food and energy," reported the magazine "image" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic Institute and Research of the economic cycles.
The new loans of unemployment insurance may also correspond to employees.
The Minister for Finance Peter Setinbrück said to the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% through one year to another is just and reasonable.
Of course, the work office must not be replaced in a disapproval situation, requesting credits and subventions to the Federal State, the words of a politician of the German social-democracy party.
On Tuesday, the inflation rate with price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivative sector was made public for 13 years.
When comparing prices with the last year, these are increased by 3%.
Venus: Brother of the Earth.
Despite his atmosphere, Venus is the most similar planet to the Earth, something that has not been planted until now. The European sondae "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and remoloines in the poles, the same as appearing in winter on Earth.
For three decades ago, researchers had the suspicion that they could exist rays in Venus.
But now the European sonda has brought new evidence: it has discovered electrical waves at the border of the atmosphere. In Venus, the rays quiet at a height of 54 miles from a cloud and behind the other, accounting Crisʹ from the University of California in Los Angeles to the citizenical magazine "Nature".
It is the very model of Urey-Miller's life origin, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions on the ocean that, in its part, would have caused the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus isn't that: if there was a day there, it would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Today, on the surface of Venus can't have life: the atmosphere pressure is almost 100 times greater than in the Earth and on the surface, the temperatures of 500°C, so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Perhaps Venus is a "day" of the Earth, but it is still a ́lo," said he.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, such as the Earth's mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the ninety-years there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the "Venus-Express" study was a very important step for Venus research in November 2005.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature" are the opinion of researchers, not only the unity of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbor's planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," reports the ESA.
Despite the already known storm winds in the North Pool, researchers discovered in the southern Pool region also a corn formed by the clouds that turn faster.
This phenomenon refers to the wind flows in the higher ground atmosphere of the poles, described a team of researchers of Giuseppe Pi®oni of the Italian Institute of Special and Space Astrophics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12.000 km results almost so large.
This planet also called white star or evening star around the sun almost 225 days.
But his rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmosphere pressure of 92 bars is not very similar to the Earth, the scientists are part of the basis that both planets have been formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water was aglomerated that remained in the oceans on Earth, but in Venus was disowned in the universe.
While the carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus is most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's middle with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the President of the Federal, insists at the end of the fight between parties for the receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancer.
He criticized indirectly the German social-democracy party for its attacks to the Federal Canciller after mythin in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, concerned about Germany's reputation, and therefore said that the great coalition would end that fight for the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Kohler said to the journal "Handelsblatt".
At the same time, Kohler showed its understanding about the receipt of Dalai Lama by Merkel Angel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely vital for me," Kohler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must act with great balance in external policy, underlined by the Federal President, defending Merkel by the reproche that he received by implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Canciller did not take the distance from the traditional course of a China policy.
China also knows it," Kohler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democracy Party), had expressed its disappointment for the receipt of Dalai Lama and was attacked by the members of the Union.
In addition, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative policy in the external matter.
The receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancilleria caused great incomprehensions in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese Government refused not only the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister for Finance of Germany, but also the information sources of the magazine "Spegel" were frozen by the called strategy dialogue of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chief of Chinese Government, made the Federal Canciller Merkel Angela to recognize this receipt of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
As a result of China's position, Wen Jibao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of the Tibetan in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama proved that it is going to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region in China, which now includes other provinces.
Shaeuble warns that disturbances like the events in France will occur.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disturbance will occur as was the case of France.
The Federal Minister requires that it be done all possible so that social insatisfaction in Germany is not transferred to the streets.
They were made barricades, the vandales shot the police with fusils: after severe disturbances for young people in France, the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (The Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must fix TAMBIEN in that social problems in our country do not take the violent form."
"This is what we have to take seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in constant changes in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Shaeuble.
This does not only refer to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summary to the Islam Conference: all this is already giving its first fruits."
It's still time to seat the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Shaeuble pointed out that German suburbs do not have the same building and social problems as in France.
Young people protagonized serious disturbances in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, also, cars and public buildings were burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, has increased the efforts of the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of a imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the pause between foreign youths of less than 25 years is located above the average.
It must be concerned that there are more professional training posts.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give youths a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France " there is a large social control in the families," greater than the French country.
Moreover, most of the foreign youths don't want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat says, "But despite all, we need to be careful."
It is necessary to "build the opportunity for young people to get a job or professional training faster."
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburbium Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of cops participated in the action, and a helicopter with fairs overflowed the territory.
The responsible authorities informed three detentions, as well as packs and cars burned.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1000 police is occupied with security.
After a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Internal Affairs, announced that the police would take rigorous measures until necessary.
On Monday night on Tuesday about 80 police were wounded by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued next night in Tolouse.
The disturbance comes for a trading accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
Information provided by fiscality, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The very far from the reality of the Federal Canciller, shows that the coalition on the content has reached its last point and that there is nothing more to be expected from it.
But in what country does Canciller really live?
After her unexpected, independent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower Chamber, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As regards the reproche that it has been made for repeated dedication to external policies, Canciller will have it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that it would be a provinced way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what is interested in critics.
In the Lower Chamber, it was very clearly declared to all that reproche was appropriate.
No minimum interest could be felt, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented this way: a very high policy that flees in the external policy and remains there without reaching anything concretely.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it is very grateful to himself for the decisions taken in Saintndamm, but it does not say anything about how these objectives should be carried out here in climate issues.
Generally, this way of praising himself - two years ago the leader of the Democratic Union Party has not been allowed to allow so much modesty.
Then it's working in expressions so that it's an impulse to people.
And in this way, it hurts its public image for the pragmatic concept that solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the Kingdom of Angela Wolke, the internal problems are a little valuable appearance.
The poverty of children and concerns for low salaries?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject using subordinated prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to talk about the addition for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three efforts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It starts to throw "as if it had been on an unknown territory" when it was more concrete information.
The section of attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, have made an accurate debate on the YouTube Republical Presidential Presidency and now they should fear only a candidate from the outside.
The tensions between candidates have been noted since a beginning.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have converted to New York to "a resistance site for illegal immigrants".
He answered with serious reproofs: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani answered the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was who used illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates have the attacks: as the group of Republicans has not a clear favour, the eight presidential preliminary states use the debate in the CNN, especially in order to disapprove their opposers.
The 30-second small videos, rotated by Internet users sent to Youtube, do not have much content.
"In this way of isolation, we let Hitler get to power," that was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the people who insisted on subsequently returning to Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many critics from the veterinarians of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to recognize the "Waterboarding" torture, a questioning method, by allowing a person to fall into a person simulate his death.
The public's reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important issues of the campaign are other, not only war in Iraq or torture debates.
The public has always been very strong when they praised the conservative values and refused to take up taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"In that time, I was wrong," said Romney compounded and requested permission to people and to the television public because he was a defensor of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani did not know what to say when they asked him what he thought about literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf governments without uniform.
On one day after his release as the leader of the army, the President of Pakistan was made to swear as a president.
That's how the eight years of military government end in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took an oath for a second mandate of 5 years.
The Pakistanian TV directly transmitted the ceremonie in the presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his military head mandate to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after the power was made with an incredible military struggle, the former general governments the state as civil leader for the first time.
With his renouncement to the head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main of opposition and west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of imprisonment, which was announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
See Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the general state charger, after Musharraf's oath, will quickly cancel the state of imprisonment and will fulfil the second with the western.
Since the state of appointment in the Supreme Court was announced, there were many partial jurists of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country had all resources before the new elections of the Government head on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers died, and four other soldiers were injured.
A bomb exploded in one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
Return the Krautrock funders.
The most German band of the 70s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restaurant, a copy of "Live 1974", which was written in the best time of the band.
They were very famous in foreign countries at that time.
The assistance of these three ladies to an official food caused sensation.
Each of them has his boxes, cabs, and above all its buttons.
In the middle it is sitting in Dieter Moebius, who is 63 years old, and is dressed with a white truck.
On your left is the 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his phone computer and the guitarra.
At the dee, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, age, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes to his sounds, among them there is even a ritme.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a part of music.
It seems that this doesn't hurt the ladies.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's passionates was the fact that the Armonia band would do music again.
What is needed to be rebuked here is the following: exactly questions have shown that the name of the band was retreated in the mind of people, but it wasn't such a special thing that the public would be surprised after 32 years.
But why can't Germans also applaud their live legend of the seventy years?
In particular because the Krautrock Equivoc was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a "Echo" music premium to the members of the Can 2003 band for its lifework, in the room the surprised faces of the German pop artists were seen.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened the mouth with amazing.
Later Michael Rother spent time on the scenario during the Concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition in the foreign, are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band because the triumph was only two years old and at those times I have no great effect on the public, however, it has been successfully obtained by others.
Ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first, they were playing in Berliner Shaubuehne's sothan.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
A while, Rother had a work in powerwork and then worked as a guide in the New band! He was able to improve the fame of this German band that at those times was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster musicians in the Forst Exilie in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as repositories of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was better a life of artist full of surprises.
See they say, one day an Ottenstein Harmonia association flag appeared in the bathroom, which was a good name for the art.
There were also disappointments in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not only to meet himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was held during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that there were almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propulse Harmonia and to do soon when you tried.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this requirement is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended on the subjects of esoterism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster has revised the eighteen years and since then has been more successful than Harmonia.
The direct Property of the Album in Griessmer, that must be thanked to Groenemeyer.
Your Greenland Music Company was placed as a aim to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as a living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the New band! was again desert.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band is located in the World Culture House in Berlin.
The band was subvented with public measures of the Wordtronic festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
There is also the Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all Krautrock' influences on the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied with special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, her belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a finger.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where caves are viewed.
In the bottom there are three veterinarians who began to improvise again.
They do nothing more than fixing microphones to the body and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tons with the help of the effect equipment they have built with their own hands.
Now, electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who deepen in the technology.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment, it is sorrowing, and at a good time of emphasis it sing "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already a English term.
But it was never rock.
It was not looking for the origin of the gender in the blues, but on the music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or running from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here crys "68!" has also the right, but now Harmonia keeps the calm.
The scenario is very well reflected on what is already clear.
Where starts and where does the music end?
This can break one's nerves or give a short time of happiness.
Richard Gere only missed most cinism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Peace" are again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But the two had not much convinced.
Or the concepts are very fixed in actions and tyrotees or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't also help in this case.
At the beginning, there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, continue to hide themselves in the Balkan mountain, but exactly there, in the darkness of the country during the Bosnian war, was deteriorated again by actor Richard Gere.
Finally, we had lost the most beautiful man of the eighth years, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunting party becomes what he follows" (Why today the film titles must be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the bottom, its reporter's role in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and the cinema industry would not have been so miserable with him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his defense had kept the most of his pleasure until now.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, together with the "Moerderischer Peace" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, it is likely to be just a series of unsuccessful films on war in the Balkans.
The movie "Moerderischer Peace" can be reported in few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia of Kosovo francothers, one of them acts very quickly and that also brings him to love it.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and tyrotees, although we conclude that Serbs are not present again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without self-piste, but in war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated because there was never a good film on war in the Balkans.
In another moment, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story of reporters and reporters in the war that are going to detect a war criminal serb called "sturm", may probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are extraordinaryly similar: the small teams go to the mountain twice to do something that the army cannot do, and every time it comes to a crazy travel.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning we are presented to Simon Hunt, to whom they do not let him be just a cyclic with heart.
No, the script also provides a loving adventure with a Muslim bosney that will kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, especially when the reporters with an impressionant speed achieved what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the ≥ and all the world's heads' hunterers, who was capturing the war criminal and leaveing them to the Muslim boss so that they would be recompensed in a just way.
It's so bad that they are pleased to call on the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human.
The movie wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about them because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, so one comes to his head a very poema of Brecht.
In this poema, it is a mask of a Asian demon: "In the big strips of his front I see, and feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In films such as "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem consists not only of the type of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently, in a newspaper, he published that all Iraq movies produced in Hollywood are fashioned.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
It is almost always worth a rule: when a star is held by a crisis region or by the mine fields, then there appears something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Along the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blue Diamonds" with DiCaprio.
Probably all these conflicts had occurred in a short time space.
They have to pass for at least decades until Hollywood rushes a good movie on the film with the "The List of Schindlers".
Some movies already need more time. Classicals like the works on war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" at their time were not celebrated by unity as teachers' works.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and therefore, in our time, every murder (Massenmord) is presented directly in two televisions at home.
And that's because Scriptural authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"See or not" or "The Great dictator" resulted in such a good end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know that this bad was actually the Nazi regime.
Maybe it shouldn't be a good person to rotate a movie.
Maybe it must be like the newspaper Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant view of a artist.
When they asked him about the parallels between his historic "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "It is only due to that some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be murdered cruelly, and in Yugoslavia will always rule war.
Von Beust receives a response to the negative critical on Olympics Games.
The Chairman of Hamburg has received many critics from the policy and economy for not requesting the Olympics of the Soul.
Many people want to continue fighting for competitions in the aquatic sports section.
But Beust recalls that it must be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Trade Camera, showed on Wednesday this renounce as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times, no other project in the large city has promoted such motivation as the idea of the organization of Olympics Games.
"Unless this goal, the political impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz held the senate not to view this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Captain Ole von Beust held its statements that Hamburg's ambitions in the Organization of Soul Olympic Games were not performed until at least 2028.
"Hamburg doesn't decide on the request for Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympics Deports determines it," says von Beust in the WE_ONLINE.
He sent to the Deport Federation (Sportbund) decision expected at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympical Games in winter of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, that we were thinking to have until 2028, from the realistic point of view, we will not have any opportunity."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Deport Federation (HSB) regrets the statements of von Beut.
This makes the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg doesn't want to ask for Olympics Games.
"It's too quick to leave the opportunity, if the plans are now destroyed," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, HSB director.
A rejection of the application is contradictory to the declaration of the Senate head in a receipt due to the general of the German Public Federation of Deport of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designed Hamburg's request for Universities of 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympics Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the High School Deport Federation appointed Hamburg as candidate.
The Fraction of the German Social-Democrate Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraction) reproached the senate that he did not use so valuable time for the building of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was delayed with the development of the small village of Grasbrook because this was in plans for Olympical Games or the building of houses," Carola Veit and Jan Qust, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of builded houses, the CDU highlighted the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the Olympical Games in 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wood boxes.
Who relates the terms of Sweden and wood box, thinks about Ikea, but doesn't think about Andy Warhol.
Or so?
Currently, the wood boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighting on the Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are ́s.
After a few months ago, the Swedish magazine "Expressen" would doubt about Brillo-Boxes' ability in 1968 of Andy Warhol, the modern Museum of Stockholm performed internal investigations and reached deceiting conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the ex-director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the Modern Museet Museum, are, and almost a hundred of the other "type Stockholm", which are in the market of international art, also results.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artificial and patrocinated productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted red, white and white wood boxes with the same sample that they had "Brillo" powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 in the modern Museum Museum, hundreds of brillo-boxes were exposed. These did not warhol (from expenditure), but were directly delivered from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not artificial works, but examples (which were only some objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce a brilliant wood box in Sweden, but they were not exposed to the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of that nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of the art and the boxes as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorised by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were bought for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the Pontus Hultén Museum's president would make statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wood boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exposure in San Petersburg.
Warhol had already died since three years ago.
Lars Byström, the leader of the modern Museum conservators, investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and three of the Swedish private property that were made in 1968 in Stockholm. First, they were printed and sprayed and then painted on oil with the pincel.
In contrast, the 1990 copies show that the painting was applied with a rodle without printing exactly the coated silver. It is also not the oil painting but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Committee in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/objects of exposition."
In July, the Authentication Committee has formally announced that these "severe accusations" were accepted in the case of jabbon powder boxes.
But since that moment, everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebeld soldiers ride in Manila.
