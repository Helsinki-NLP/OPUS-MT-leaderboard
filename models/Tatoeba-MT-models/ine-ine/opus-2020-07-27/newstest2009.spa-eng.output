The Prague Bolsa ended with less points at the end of the day
After the fast fall of the morning, the Prague Bolsa corrected its losses.
The transactions of the CHEZ actions reached approximately the half of the value they had on a normal day.
At the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Bolsa repeated immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended approximately to 6%.
The down this time is due to the fall of action on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market is also expressed to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the secretary of the financial sector's stability plan.
Cases of action in Asia
The actions of the Asian Bolsas lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, although during the day, it finally reduced part of losses.
The Hung Seng Bolsa of Hong Kong during its financial daymarked nearly four percent, although later he reduced its losses by reducing the decrease in almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises who followed the movements of Chinese actions in the Hong Kong Bolsa descended a 3.8 percent, in Shangai markets were closed.
The actions of the Sidney Bolsa lost more than five percent, but, finally, losses descended to 4.3 percent.
The Taywan Board was guarded by the Index Secretary to 3.6 per cent.
"The rescue action scheduled in the United States are insecure and this affects the financial market of all the world," said the Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
American legislators should return to the meeting as soon as possible, the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal for support to the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatenes that falls will be felt in other countries.
United States blood bathroom
On Monday, the United States Assembly of Representatives 日 the financial system assistance plan to which 700 billion dollars should be dedicated (approximately 12 billion crowns).
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support their plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the shares collected the largest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' Property was nearly seven percent. A similar volume fall was finally registered in 1987.
It came down before it was announced, but soon it was shown that the proposal of the assembly was not going out, the empe_ to fall freely.
The conference is revoked: The US Government can inject $700 billion in the United States
The highest representatives of the Congress and the Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a large term of financial assistance to the American financial system.
Its vote will be made at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators made a break in the discussions on the approving the salvation plan in their form of aid to the American financial system with $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
However, it is not winning yet.
Congressists must draw up some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He said on Sunday to the Realings Agency, Barney Frank, president of the Committee on Financial Services and the Assembly Bank.
There are some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate not before Wednesday.
Economys are the arrival of the ratification of the redemption plan to represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalisation of the financial market.
Thereafter, however, it will be reached to the "depreciation" through the complete mechanisms which market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We solve our discrepant opinions regarding the way the market stability package should have," commented the democracy Nancy Pelosiá to the Bloomberg Agency.
If it is said, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators gathered on Sunday night with the Minister for Finance, Henry Paulson, to give him a definitive form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial companies the non-sealed hypotechnical assets that lead to financial undertakings to hard losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are willing to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue with the health plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is expressly on the market of action quickly decreasing.
The Democracy Senator is held by Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything possible in order that the Congress definitively adopts an agreement this Sunday.
They wish to relax investors' businesses in the Asian financial market because these are those who are in the first hour court and where the Congress could affect the trade of Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two cameras of the American Congress will vote and, if it does not, they will not have any problem at the last time.
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the next days.
However, the law will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not comply with its role, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President can take this decision, but the Congress can overcome its veto by majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme consisted of gaining financial resources for the recovery of bad hypoteches whose value was fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their hypoteques.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
Your carrier, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of the Sabbath and that values "the emphasis of both parties by stabilizing our financial market and protecting our economy".
Limitation of the blinded contract
The Chairman of the Senate Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme's money for the protection of contributors' taxes, a flexible clause of the plan of funds.
The new law should also limit the claimed blinded contracts for directors of the participating companies in the programme, and establish a committee with control of the Fund.
This would have to be addressed by the Minister for Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes helping home owners who have problems with their payments.
The Government should agree with the new payments of the hypoteques that he purchases in order to reduce the payments of the debtors at the time and enable them to stay with their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, it is, the Chief Economicist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be made but very difficult.
"And that is why you don't know with what mechanism and what price the problem activity will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan be adopted now or at the beginning of the next week is not, Marek, so relevant.
"More important is that, this week, the congressists agree with their support and give them their view well before it is possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval is reached is, at this time, the most important," Marek insisted.
Weaponsed fight: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
What seems clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for the human to add only the player.
The election is practically depending on the way it uses and the need for the future owner.
Probe will be difficult to add the most modern tocadic to listen to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as the LP disks are no longer out, and in terms of their quality there is no one objective reason to continue to understand them.
If the vinyl discs are packed in their stations with art rock, jazz or blues music, they are probably dreaming at least with this type of touch.
This is the same with the music that is on the road, namely, the compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here are price and quality categories.
For some, it may be inacceptable to spent eight thousand crowns in a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lovers who will hardly test the 20-krone market boxes.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each one.
The election is large.
Determines also the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what they do not even have the majority of mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elemental functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, playing both, having a better or worst graphy device and even getting browser.
And when we take into consideration the artphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in their bottle.
This is a small milagro, because no nerve knows to make a parrillad and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us desvantages.
How many more functions it uses in the mobile before the screen indicator will be illustrated asking to be reloaded.
And music playing is one of the largest energy traces.
A few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of them less.
In this regard, music players (in particular the most simple) have clearly a greater performance.
Thus, take note that nice mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If, besides this, they are calling constantly, for more security, a loader for the work - this is also valid for the most dear devices.
With the MP3 player, this problem will not be done, because even the worst hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem occurs in music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only one part of the devices has the USB universal engine and not all can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music is possible directly on the memory card, but only in some unreduced player units can connect small memory cards used in mobiles.
In players, with some iPod, no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music with the USB of the computer.
Most mobile and players create their order only in the music library is the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or also the user assessment.
Some devices only show a directory with tree like a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
The player serves, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific team, it is interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the ability of memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you hear, especially, music as a background and will listen to it every day only a mouse, like in the tramway, then it's enough with any mobile that plays.
What practically gets really any mobile.
Not even if you are interested in the format where the mobile or player plays music.
The MP3 plays it all and, almost, almost all music you come will be in this format.
It is located among the most extended and except for him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
At least includes the AAC format (format used by Apple and their iPod).
The best mobiles also enable, for example, online music purchasing.
Just via the mobile Internet visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument to buy a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is weak and most are limited only to the issues of fleeting success from radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, generally, this way of music sale (or GSM, Internet or Internet) is expected to be dominated in the future by the music industry.
Most people always carry on a mobile.
When you appreciate to listen to something, you will find the mobile in your bottle, while the MP3 player will be resumed at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a hearing or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player who has almost every mobile even if it is at least a MP3 player.
Prove the greatest benefit for many of the music mobiles will be your price.
The most poor costs usually less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic hearing entry.
The best, even as regards the technical part, such as the phones equipped with an entry of 3,5 mm. for classic audiculars, cost up to 15 000.
Again, the advantage of players is not something else than their easy service.
The most simple players - in no way necessaryly the most beautiful (see our selection) - really handles any person.
Minimum functions, your management is similar to the previous running cases or also to the tocadisks.
It is not a threat in the sense that we are connected to the Internet for mistakes with the mobile and, therefore, gigantic account for downloading of data.
By what device to decide
Even the most beautiful mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have generally a slot to change memory card (M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card, it will reach the two thousand crowns.
Nevertheless, be careful.
Basic models, usually, are equipped with only 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the dearest have a 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a MP3 nice player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Capacity (maximum 2 GB) is not required for more than 1.100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most exquisite music lovers, take hands of the most specialized mobile-walkman mobile (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes such a comfortable service as the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost identical use as one of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category on price, over the four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the above mentioned mark would bring them to MP3 players.
The first operator will already come to the Czech Republic this year.
Testing
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is very developed and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still miss something - the operator, which would force those to be more beautiful.
Try it's not going to come for a long time.
That the Czech operators are part of the dearest Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTU) that warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is of the most decent of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming rates, it is likely to reach a paradoxical situation - for some of the Czech mobile operators' clients, the SMSs sending from the foreigner will be better than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
Try this looks paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high covering is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
This is why the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Pavel Dvořák, has also expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operators.
It may be true that for a classic operator with his own network no longer have too many opportunities (for the rest, it would be hard to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the operator.
Exactly the entry into the mobile phone market brought a highlighted price decrease to which classic operators should have also re-entered.
At the same time, even before the input of tiburons, as well as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market of Great Britain, there were hearing similar voices.
It was shown that there is a place for this type of operators and that they can have success.
Moreover, it is not necessary to look for examples too far.
In February of this year, we informed you about the outside of the Mobilking Operator in Poland.
Only after a half years, this operator was able to get over 100 thousand clients and become the fifth largest operator in the neighborhood country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the group Penta is located that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The benefit of operators is in the possibility of focusing on many more target groups.
Moreover, so that they can work effectively, they are enough with many less clients than a classic operator.
They do not carry great expenditure in building, functioning and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer calls and messages of nice SMS that, however, often contrary to the most adjusted services offer.
Thus, for example, the mobile Tesco in Great Britain offers at least half of the pools in respect of competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it may also be a good struggle to put up by nothing trivial target group.
This operator is directed specifically to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator who likes and in whom you can trust," says David Seibert, the Mobile Entertainment Company CEO, who works this operator.
It is difficult to say if it is like a concept like that of Poland could be involved in our country.
That is why the Vodafone portrait, Miroslav Čepisk: "The Czech market is small for segments on which the majority of operators are based.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the service offer is saturated"
There are no possibilities in the Czech Republic, said mobile operators
However, it seems almost sure that if there is any operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the extension of this successful project, however, in R. Czech does not seem too hopeful.
This is better about mobilking in other countries of our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studičková, the Porter of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, he assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not drawn to this idea.
Instead, they do all that they can so that there is no potential competition.
Interest on the employment of a mobile operator already shows that GTS Novera group would like to make a further step to become a real competence of O2 Telephone in the field of business clients.
"We have great interest in it, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And how much before, better.
With this opportunity, we have met us repeatedly with all Czech mobile telephone operators.
With some of them we have been able to progress at the meetings," said the portfolio of the group, Pavel Kaidl.
Then, maybe they're deploying better time.
It seems that, by non-official information, the first official operator would have to reach the end of the year.
But for now, her appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"In this moment, we believe that the situation is enormous for the appearance of an operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
Even the present no one has been addressed to us with a complete and serious project in this area," expressed for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Srszeň, telephone carrier O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-mobile portfolio, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "We today have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally useful, can continue development."
And adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should have on the table some concrete contract that was possible to study in such a short time."
Vodafone guides its attention rather to the compliance with the own requirements of a licence of 3G.
Miroslav Čepisk adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential operators, and this regarding the distribution of costs and infra.
That is exactly what we consider as the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
The main Vodafone strategy in this field is located in the partner with which to establish a quick internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with single and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily comprehensive, but the entry of another operator would mean to increase competition which would lead to a decrease of prices, and thus to a decrease of profits.
Why then facilitate the entry into competition?
When the operators want to get something, they are lusts to get out of the same horn, testing is the agarron when U:fon arose.
Perhaps the highest pressure on the CTU was at the time of the U:fon entry by the T-Mobile society.
It tests the public information available on the web pages of the CTU.
But exactly now U:phone serves as an argument why not accept a operator.
Martina Kemrová adds this: "No longer the environment on the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the characteristic of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player in the market would provide for him and, in particular, for his great requirements."
That is why this access to mobile operators is very disappointing due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not only the position of the CTU, which, despite all, has no competence to intervene in trade claims, contrary to Great Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely belonging to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licences (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical position before this problem.
"The introduction of a mobile phone operator to the market would be possible after a conference on the infra-processing of the necessary between a mobile phone operator and a phone operator.
Even today no convention has been concluded since the offer of interested potentials was better not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," he added to our Christian Chalupa question from the UOHS External Relations Department.
These statements are not subject to the representatives of the operations.
For the offices that should represent consumers' interests is something more than one consideration, they should notice that no one is using their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign where the operators operate normally, we can note that their market entry has contributed to the low prices of mobile telephone services"
Clearly, pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and price decrease is not within the interest of UOHS.
Really, the dramaticly shocking in all this case is in the disoning reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is actually a chase, it is offered by himself.
It is the same as the price of gasoline in the gaslines because it is clear that it is the work of cattleness and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found any signs of disloyal competition and has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore, a relevant responsibility in their market actions.
The tools necessary to open the mobile phone market to operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunication regulators," Chalupa added to their response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
It is obvious that there is an analysis of relevant markets established by the CTU where telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of the commercial invitation.
In this type of market, of course, no of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a operator to appear, it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopolie of your network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must be necessaryly dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should be a warning of the fact that three mobile operations are calling on the same way.
Current complaints of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operations, many likely prevents.
Loading responsibility in the CTU is a very common truck in the telecommunications field of which UOHS wash the hands in all this matter.
We've already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Law was submitted for the extension of the CTU competition in the field of trade claims that were not implemented, even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be known perfectly by UOHS representatives, but it is obvious that their interests are otherwise.
Everything's fine, when no one looks at
At the same time, something still works unexpectedly as well as a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in the Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies who put their own prices to mobile telephone services which, however, only one part are public.
Normally, it is business dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
Normally, only some chosen are obtaining the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic business client of the same by responsibility of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that trade conditions in all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit such revenge.
"If cases were discovered like those mentioned could be spoken of violation under contract conditions that could be translated at the end of the cooperation with the given society," Martina Kemrová answered the question on this issue.
But it is pretty unlikely that this type of activity carried out by mobile telephone operators would not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
No operators are opposed to this procedure.
With these enterprises' activities, there are no disappointable profits and, at the same time, in the contrary to the authentic operators, no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk warns us about the possible problems: "the law allows a specifying of this type, however, the services of this company are only used by a fraudible so much percent of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not to his name so they can't absolutely dispose of it as a normal client of the operas."
That is exactly what it should look like at least strange CTU.
Moreover, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephone operations round the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it does not want to satisfy the explanations of the operations that they have no idea of this story and that its commercial conditions do not allow it.
We'll stop being the most dear
As it has already been clear in the text, the entry into the mobile phone market led significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, nearly in all countries where the operator had occurred, classic operations have been more or less protected from this irrevocation.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
However, in the most advanced countries, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in no of the cases have defended operations but their customers.
With formal or informal pressure, they have already achieved the first operator and with him they have started to come to another.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all of this case is going to happen as if it was a clause of driving.
Because of our experience, we can not stop impressioning that confusion of assignments in these cases will be convinced.
But we won't desperate.
If this information between bastards is correct and the operator really comes to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market probably begins to move again.
If any of the operations let some mobile telephone operators enter, it will be difficult that the UOHS may remain independent of other interested.
And we may stop calling more dear than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hino has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official hino.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official celebration of the Heaven where my home.
The new himno took it to the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bałohlavek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one a man's voice and another a female voice, another with Coro and another instrumental.
Del Canto is responsible for Catherine Priest y Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the himno arrangements are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Belohłavek considers this national cheque angle as one of the most beautiful himnes.
The Czech Radio already said that he intended to choose for the Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have made with the two and then, also with the Cor which were set in the word so that the text might be well understanded, so that it might have consonance," he commented.
The Czech official hino celebrates its 175 anniversary next year.
The song Where, my House sounded for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Cheese work Fidlovačka of Joseph Kaietán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people did it.
The first strife of the song after the occurrence of Czech Slovakia in 1918 became naturally part of the official hell.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the occurrence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" himno sounds
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Undertaking on the date on which the first passengers enter into the metro, tranquil and bus with a good electronic in their bottles instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at these moments for almost 100 000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy 30 days, 90 days and the year (these will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously carry it on their chip card in the information centres and posts of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Museum, Mostek, Nadraží Holešo, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska, Kacherov and Luka.
Goods can be purchased since yesterday on the Internet on the transport company's pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the evening, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a trade form can definitively start from the sales of billets at the metro stations, where they had to regularly make school to get out a normal billet.
The good is bought on the Internet, and the Opencard card is reloaded to you in some of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a passengers' window with prepared personally supporting interested people with Internet purchasing and with the recharge of the good bought on their card," said the project portfolio, Martin Opatrny.
Besides the library, it will also be possible to reload the electron in the Opencard on automatic machines expenses in some metro wheels.
How are these machines spent?
They're red, we're replaced by a pick-up machine, and the travelers will probably have already been fixed on them at the Rostyly metro stations, Bu日ovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there is five in the city but at the end of the year it would have to be eighty," Opatrny completed.
The good is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just introduce the Opencard chip card and the good paid previously will be loaded only in it.
Electronic goods from morning are valid not only in capital but also in their areas.
That is, in the cycling trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the residents of the central Bohemia.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague, there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," thus explained the control of the billets, Philip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which sets the hours for the collective transport of Prague.
The cycling buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's cart.
When you enter, it is not only necessary to show the cart to the driver but also to join it with Opencard in the place for it on the side of the Box.
With that, the driver controls the validity of the good.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of goods there is nothing easier than requesting the driver this information," Drapal completed.
The passengers who do not travel in the circumvallation buses and who don't remember when they are finished the validity of the goods can be addressed to machines expenses where cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, the information on the validity of your document will be shown.
Southeasts wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
In 1945, the German Sudes asked that fum was part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Cientical Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the United States patronate.
With this desire, some groups of Germans from the Southern were probably addressed to the President of the U.S. in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that today are stored in the collection of the Centic Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov requested in a letter to the American president that does not allow the return of the "Shumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of Munich's own - again to Czech Slovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want his word that the American units are coming to German lands, not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," it is written in the letter, signed with a "the people who bring the destination of Shumava in their heart".
In order that the Czech Republic with the south-east Germans presumely - these are the national character of Czech - a hope only in brutality, disconsideration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors claim in the letter to the American president who takes up for today and forever to Shumava under a protector.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are delivered to a foreign state that oppresss and oppresss minorities and is absolutely cooperating with the victory of allies," it is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign is probably the fear of repressalities of the "Check oppressors".
If the President of the United States presumely doubts about this idea of the Shumuvish Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether its residents want to be part of the United States or live under their patronate.
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge we now have of the post war story, can sound a little infant, some specialists are closely painting the expectations of the Southeast Germans.
Although the Germans had to insinue at least that it was to be discussed about their exemption from the Republic only a few admitted this opportunity.
Some hoped that the United States and the Great Britain would negotiate some clear way of autonomy for the South.
Others believed they would stay in Czech Slovakia.
It is even confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Boo.
This was in the war, as a German of Boo, round in the Baltic sea.
When at the end of the war, British people pressed him and placed him in Holstein prisoners' field, many decades of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would come to them well," said the Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czech Slovakia, if he was, reported that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes, they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most faced action in the Czech history addressed to security on the roads.
Thus, the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transports on Media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The Minister's office, Aleš Rebiček promises that he will disobey the leaders of dangerous conduct to the volant.
The 150 million campaign will be felt in television, radio, cinema, Internet and brochure.
I would have to dissuade the high speed and alcohol driver to the flight.
And to remind them also that before they go on, the circles are reached.
He wants to reach consciousness, especially of young drivers, motorists, peatons, and finally also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the announcements?
Basically human history that embedded to emotions.
And for that, the "sanguinearies" announcements for us during the whole campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters in the matriculation.
And in a blood bottle is the word "pages".
This must symbolize that man at a time of disappointment can come to pay with his own life.
The announcements will "meat fear" to the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was allowed to be inspired by the campaign conducted in Anglosajone lands where strong images of accidents can be observed.
It promises that it will reduce accidents and the number of dead in the Czech roads.
The announcements have been developed by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and fat for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and latch system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red seamforum is going on and thus spends time.
The latigo is threatening demand or accident.
The drivers must remember the risks," says the hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
It is therefore necessary for an informative campaign in the press and, mainly, a negative publicity, concrete psychology.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there are some panels installed by warning about some dangers, it will probably soon be merged with the environment and the driver will not give you greater attention," Korjan warned.
Olmert would almost all the areas occupied in the exchange of peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, was pronounced on the refund of almost all the lands occupied in 1967, namely, West-Jordania, Jerusalem east and the Highs of Golan, in exchange of peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth journal.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all lands (occupated) if it is not all," Olmert said to the journal.
"It is sure that we will stay with a hundred of these lands, but to the Palestinians we must give one hundred like them (of the lands of Israel) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that in the case of refund, this would also be included in Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn't want tractors or excavates to pass over their feet as happened to one of my best friends, then he will deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed to the two attacks of July in the city where several dead and tens of people were wounded.
It will be necessary to find "a special solution for the temple hill, holy and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to keep Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted further.
Return from the High Golan
Olmert was also pronounced by the receipt of Israel from the High Golan, which from his point of view is an inherent with the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also make concrete efforts by the part of the European Parliament.
"I don't propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's retirement," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to divorce to win the Golan.
They will abandon their current relationships with Iran, they will have to abandon their relationships with Hizbulá (Chita movement), they must be separated from the permanent support that causes Hamas terrorism (chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the azafats illegal in buses?
The law is unknown, cannot walk in a long distance bus
With regard to the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, we have the question of whether the azafats and passengers can be moved through the bus during the travel.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the azafat activity is opposed to the Vial Transit Act," says the carrier of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which last week the twenty-twenty-year azaphat died was obviously caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus was crossed on the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting at the side of the driver at the less safe location of the vehicle, despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly breathing, and at the precise time when the coffee is distributed or periodically.
Here that plays the paper is if the bus is given, it is the technical permission, with foot places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit down.
The long distance buses of Student Agency have no sites to stand, which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to the currently.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was removed and we reached the agreement that passengers could go to the bathroom by the bus running if they had a seat," he commented on our position.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no evident legal interpretation of the role of the azafat - no legal provision explains this function.
Not if any legal provision prohibits transport agents to carry out any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of the vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less tactfully, the Hanzelka portfolio.
The Director of the Department of Transport Traffic on the Road of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, thinks, in contrast, that the law takes care of this issue.
"Depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have stage sites.
That's all," he says.
Business is divided between urbans, where there are sites to stand and maximum speed limited, interrupt us with sites to stand with a higher speed permission and the long distances without sites to stand, with the highest speed permission and with seats equipped with security circle.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP expert in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Horien, does not see important problems in the bus movement of azafate.
"In the development of the travel, there is no great threat to danger, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Neither if it is here, there is the security that the turbulences come and that the azafat can be cut into the head."
" However, if the bus suddenly broke clearly that physical laws are valid.
Similarly as in a city bus or in the tranvie.
The safety of the azafat must solve it by the internal regulatory of the transporter," he also thinks that this problem is unresolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter who offers the service of azafats.
It's two hundred employed in him.
The director, neither after the accident, considers that risked job.
"Now, when I have the impression that the azafat position is risked, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when in.
"I'd even buy expenditure," he says.
In terms of security, Asiana has no azafats in its vehicles, Alexej Litvin, who leads a small line compared to SA.
"We have no azafats, we are against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a mortal accident," he said less than one year ago for Tiden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident of the line that one in Napoles died a young azafat of Pilsen who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the stationing car by blocking the step to the bus. Without using the intermittents.
His conductor tried to avoid it in a quick manner, however, shot with the part of front.
Janchura refused to have been sold by the two sites reserved for the rest of the azafat.
"These sites are not able to reserve them for long distance connections, they are locked."
The company intends to ask the driver of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the sentence of the sentence on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenditure also by the guilty.
Reform the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of azafat in the bus, in which 30 experts of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working for a year ago.
" However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the system of points, maximum autopista speed and the use of the mobile during the walk," says expert Horein.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the azafats something that threatens the safety of passengers significantly," ending Hanzelka carrier, that the safety control in bus is the competence of the police and the Security Office at work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Francfort
In the letter of the Joint Directive of West LB for its collaborators, there are no big words.
By the combination of Dusseldorf units with DEKA, a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group can be formed, as it says in writing, published on Monday
West LB, breaking the `competitive block' with sustainable ability of benefits would enter into that business.
Furthermore, such fusion may be a beginning for the following fusions in the field of regional areas.
This is how it understands the text, when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because as before the West LB is under a huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union but also from the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services, which recently has made clear to the Government of North-Westphalia that remains a little time to find a solution.
Since a while, too from Francfort, many have been spoken about the union of such type between the DEKA, that Sparkasse's customers know about their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the leader of DEKA, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, allowed to know that he doesn't see any sense in the fusion of the street, held on the street ́zer Street, with a regional place such as Helaba or West LB.
However, the management Council of the DEKA, which is now composed of the regional and Sparkassen associations, has responsibility for a joint directive to begin negotiations with West LB on common trade activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just started, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time in the Sparkassen consolidation, the name of the DEKA is shown, with its 3000 partners, among the most important businesses in the France's financial site.
In 2003, the situation appeared so that the DEKA could join the Renania-Palatinate region and the Helaba region.
This initiative to create a three-parting union has been no results.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse Government expressed against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two also did not find the same language.
Instead of this, the Regional Renaissance-Palatinate is the dialogue with the region of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of the DEKA fusing with other regional areas.
But finally Günther Merl, president of the Joint Directive of Helaba, expressed that he was against the plans of coexistence with its own.
Independently, it seems to be more clear that the union of the various public rights areas is necessary.
Then, when the elections of the Baviera parliament are going to pass, the BayernLB union with the region of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the continuing pressure will increase, Helaba will miss partners to do that.
In the south, it could be only a young partner, although it has even been much better than the financial crisis that Stuttgart and Munich's immobiles have done.
On the other hand, Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which has 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with West LB.
In any case only the North LB remains.
But such geo-strategic reflections are just one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question on a trade model that could ensure the future for regional Property, which Sparkassen-und Giro-Verband has not answered until now.
Finally, the West LB can be discomposed, but it is, of course, not the own desire of the Property.
In the letter of the Joint Directive, there is also stated that there would be a complete solution for all of them.
As co-existence between the natural parts of the parts of the DEKA can be compacted, it will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, he attended Elena as her girlfriend, and therefore everything seems different, he says.
After them, at the side of a 5-litre beer barry, Kaiser is built a huge ose tiger that shows almost 200 participants in October Fest that low sounds can produce in its garment.
First, Elena gives Luca a palm-case, then a bed.
From Bolonia, they arrived to Verona.
From there, from the parking side of the train station Porta Newa, tonight at 23:45, three buses, `Munich, the festival of the beer', press at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are intended especially for the Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the iss of the parking at the side of their flag the South Americaans are singing, they have already started to feast night.
Marco Watch says with a lot of sound, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who carries a long cover with an artificial skin bowl and wheels with silver pieces, belongs to these buses.
Since five years, they come to October, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the praises, at 22:30 the flight.
The night there means only unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The travel costs EUR 75, including the receipt of the welcome with a beer Kaiser that was made is the Baviera cleanness law, illness insurance and guide in German-Marco attended a language course in Francfort.
The buses are already on the road in the bus with the "Brennero" address
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the silence rules on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they will still need forces.
They are to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian matriculation make another pause in the 8th hour before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco Group has the arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking at the Prado de Teresa, there are some 50 other buses in Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are meeting, Marko has his last talk about how to walk.
First, you'll put a yellow fat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", at the gotic side is the page of the Marco Travel Office on the Internet: "knowscersiviaggio.it".
Second, "When the doors of the campaign's tent are opened, that means go!", Martha cried on the morning.
"Go!" Go and occupy the back sites in the campaign's tent.
"Don't take the sites forward, for we're going to block, and all with yellow fats don't sit in the same banquet, divided throughout the space!"
A litre of beer, please Marco, cost EUR 8.25.
Unexpected property
Show the security people we have good tons!
He's just going out of his place, he's already busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at the ten and half you have to come here!" Have you understand?
And now everyone goes to the October Fest.
One, to mark the way, to the yellow grass in the trees, trading signals and even in a cart of the elections of a large Popular Party of Baviera.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of October, which is known as "the end of the Italians"
There are no accurate data about the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel over the Alpes and are torturingly entering campaign tents, and 10 percent of all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Police of Munich receives aid from seven autonomous police of the province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red de Baviera that makes a statistics of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, are in front of the English (approximately 60 assistants) and the Austrians, take the first place.
The preferred tent of the Italian campaign is thus called Hofbräuzelt.
Nights without sleep for the Believes of the King State
The Dutch's stabilised system, focused only on the last week by the Federal Minister for Finance Peter Steinbrück.
Well, that the politician would use the word "relatedly" and added that the German area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the end of the week.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the financing of Munich immobile, quoted in DAX, receives from a consortium of Germans a billion loan in order to resist turbulences on the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation said to Reʹs: Credit aid increased up to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate will use has to throw interests.
The money comes as from the privates also from public rights.
The cause is the losses of the Depfa branch.
It is a report that the state financials with the money provided for long-term projects have only financed a short period - which is now not more possible because of uncertainty in the markets.
In the first half of the year, the reserve of capital in reality has fallen in 95 per cent, 2.37 million euros, and the percentage of the own capital has also delayed a little of 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
In comparison with the same period last year, the continuous income of financial investments and net benefits of financial operations fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some value titels also tend to be lower than 70 per cent, in EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many income of the refunds of the compensation costs of the ex-group Depfa and the refund of interests is the federal tax code and the business organized for consortian companies, the negative salary could cause a deficit with approximately 16 per cent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former State financial at the beginning was lost in speculations with industrial credits for the immobile, which served for reason for the foundation of the Aareal.
Since much money could not be gained with the financing of State projects, the Defa emphasises to intensively dedicate himself to infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors and States (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the branch that has a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is said very impressively.
It's a fact that the dividends have cancelled.
For 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Real State Hypo became an important state and financial financial in the infrastructure area.
As the customer depth does not have, he, compared to others, is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market.
With the severity of the investment and the Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the concession of interbank credits was essentially decreased because the stakeholders were deteriorating their liquidity.
Each year, the Real State Hypo needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of the Defa credit portfolio of its short-term refinancing measures.
The Real Estate report is covered with a credit for the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets which are now essentially not able to work"
Other sources say that the refinancing is guaranteed by this money until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Joint Hypo Real Estate Directive, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the pre-time.
The German Central Property and the Federal Financial Service Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are part of the basis that the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That must be expected by the  skuldists and the creditors of the crew.
However, because of the dynamic and implicitity of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even imaginable that financing is not needed in its full volume.
But the contrary case cannot be excluded.
The voice of the last Sunday hour was still almost in vain, so the temporary salvation can also not be quiet for at least anxious people.
The share price falled to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
The loan courses, in contrast, are really good.
While priority debts are almost not changed, the loan courses are clearly aligned with the position in the property registration.
They are particularly affected by all the loans of the former branch Württemberg Hypo, and the loans of their ventures are based on 2009.
After a significant growth of the Depfa crisis and acquisition affected by the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its loans which were previously an investment for speculations must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the Governments, the Governments and the lowly affected governments are still ready to support the system, as long as it can be removed from the deterioration of pensions within a period.
Or something will happen, which will not be able to imagine anybody-- the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the crossed news about partial statistics, the security already in its border has now become a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because the believers will pass the night without sleep, breaking the head on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
A short-term investors can still put the final point and use the new transport of losses for the next payment of profits on change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When the first day, Sylvana Hiltrop, 16-year-old girl, had to be presented at the High School of Tachibana, the girls began to laugh: Germany is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchange she tells Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before going to college, I was afraid.
I live at Tokio's border in Kawasaki's direction and I'm going to train 40 minutes to the High School Tachibana.
I had to find the way alone, for lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as rigorous as in my house, in Baja Sajonia.
From the eightth morning the students come, at the nineth less than twenty begins a little with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I had touched me to present me.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks very pleasingly in the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put a old wallet of my mother's anfitrion family and also a bluss, calcetines and black skin shoes.
Then, so dressed, I put me on the puppit and tried to say everything right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and in a week it'll be my birthday.
At this point, I was very happy because I had started studying this language for two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have kissed, laughed and made signs and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her about my Mangas.
This belongs to the Japanese super-equipment vocabulary and means "mona, nice"
Then I quickly slew my place.
The girl on the side had a big smile, for her was a honor that the exchange girl had to sit at her side.
The rest of the class was quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really asleep.
Everyone talked at the same time, laughed and asked many questions -- at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then, in the recreation, all of them took their Bentos.
My family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else else than whispered German bread pieces.
He had rise with grass, small salts, pipe and algas, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases, I don't have any idea what this way is here in Japan.
The things are rare, and they have a new sabor.
What's sure is that everything is very rich.
Then, maybe with an appreciation of marine circles in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, the wells are not just a breakfast.
Sometimes a girl prepares a very artificial festival made for a boy and gives it in hope to be able to meet him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very interesting in seeing if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokio to attend school a year.
Then I always answered:
"Good, because I'm fascinated."
Finally since years I prefer to read Mangas.
To be able to understand better comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me, I was absolutely sure that one day I'm going to travel there.
It's also because I have a bottle by tradition and customs.
Here they have a great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I'm not still feeling lost here, though Tokio is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Mouse also have feelings
It is said that a rate or a rate feeling the danger is running away, why is it also scared?
Joseph Le Doux, scientist in the area of neurology, is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
How can you control if they, behavior in the similar way of us, feel the same?
In a web magazine called "E" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
ONLINE SPIEL presents in a series the answers selected to the question What do you think you are true without trying it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or someone else could prove it until now, even though we can prove that others have conscience.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and generally on consciousness, we enter the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rate is in the danger, it does the same as the other animals: the dead is made, fled or attacked.
People behave similarly, so some scientists make conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain make us difficult to contact our subjective experience with the animals.
First, almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the front frontal floor of the brain cortex (as a result of their participation in short memory and the executive functions leading to conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal cloud of the brain cortex, including knowledge of whom we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even the man is different from the other primates.
Another particularity is located in the human language nature: As most of his experience is united with the language, this often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even when the conscience would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it did, in many cases would be different from most of our states of conscience.
Therefore, it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If it, like something interesting and subjective, doesn't let it be measured because it has the special hardware, nor let it be analyzed by our experiences, so his research provides us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
The processes of consciousness of animals can be investigated without taking into account their content, and that is what happens during short memory studies, especially in the example of visualisation.
But with this approach that they followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing is more important to the neutral corrals of the conscience than to the causeal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal bulk of the brain cortez for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for feelings?
I devote the fact that in the emotional system, a part of the brain that is responsible for it is active, the same thing is happening with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when brain activity takes a space of the defence system (or its consequences such as the body's reactions).
As regards this point of view, feelings are very fixed apart from the brain cortez which distinguishes primates and especially humans.
As a view of the language nature, there are classifications of final feelings because we can distinguish and classify states with the means of words and grammatics to be able to describe the states of others to usself.
For example, Antonio ́co, contrary, thinks that feelings are resulting from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortez responsible for the body feelings and the encamp tronco, Jaak Pankseep thinks the same, but is more focused on the encamp.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against it, but I don't think it is.
Pakseep arguments that what mouths and men feel as afraid, maybe it feels in two cases like this: But how can it be controlled if mouths and men behave similarly feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockpit flee, then why is he afraid?
I believe that the similarity of the behavior yet does not prove the likeness of experience.
That is true that neuronal comparison helps: mouths and men have similar encamps, the cocktails otherwise don't have at least one brain.
Is it the crack of the head that is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of mouse?
I think mouths and other mammifers, possibly also cooking ( Who knows it?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behaviour of mouths that emotional feelings because their feelings probably distinguish primarily from us (for human conscience refers to special circuits and languages).
In any case, there is expected progress in the area of neurology as the same measurement of mouths and men is expected.
As I don't investigate the language and my mouse conscience, as well as feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see any more than my in the fields, but I prefer to progress than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm practical emotional.
EUFA Platini President: Grace term for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the suppleant Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government views the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as the proof of the confidence of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's campaign together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnistie for our country.

Distressed contrast of Dennis Quaid
She wanted to promote a new movie, talking on a private life interview - and she has problems with her former husband: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star designed her former husband as a adulter.
He's angry and contradicted.
The subsequent war of the two roses in the former park of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors have shown publicly an unappreciable fight between them.
The last week in an interview with the magazine and InStyle Meg Ryan for the first time spoke about the reasons of marriage failure: "Dennis was a lot of time appealing to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her unfaithfulness only after divorce.
The reason for the discovery of private things was Ryan's work with the pressure for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to the designation of him as a female husband was clear: "This is injured that Meg counts the history of our relationship in another version," said the 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "plaudable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will "remember in public pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is again married and a short time a father of them.
And that's how it ends with its statements, putting it out: "Be as if my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
The prices of the airlines and hotels are decreasing
In the first half of 2008, airlines and pernoctations in Europe were more beautiful compared to the last year.
A current study is made, the aircraft billets in Germany were made to 50 percent.
Aeroplane billets and pernoctations in hotels have been made renewable - these are the results of a study of the American Express Travel Service Provider and Financial Services.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the increase in prices in the first quarter, the second half-year changed.
After the prices on the hotel market continued to grow for many years, pernoctations in many sites were made fair.
In comparison with the last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June, prices have already been reduced to 3.6 per cent comparing the last year.
The trends were more sensitive in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
See American Express, the reason for that was the debilitated dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of tourists and travellers decreased."
The decrease of hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Francfort or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline prices also showed the trends to the highest:
As a result of the increase in the cherosen prices of the Economy class travellers had to pay for a average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long distance flights were even more than 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of the aircraft in the Economy class, compared to the previous trimester, decreased in average to 12.5 percent, but the changes in prices for the Business Class and the First Class were small.
In Germany the change of prices was more significant than in other European countries:
From January to February, the prices increased to 11,9 in the second half decreased to 23,6 per cent.
It is a study, the prices for national flights in Germany even reduced to half.
The cause of price change is from one part the increase in flexible economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane, the request is decreasing.
On the other hand, there is great competence for the Open-Skies Treaty that liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the tensed situation is the cancellation of non-acquirent distance flights in aircraft companies, as well as a large number of aircraft companies that in the first half of 2008 declared in cheebra - only in Europe were 24 aircraft companies.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a gol and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes leader.
Luhukay of Borussia hasn't yet gone to make the decimal goal.
Krisoffer Klein presented very well the strong landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player begins to play late and failed to do a gol.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by repeating the event, it was clearly read about his owns.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second gol," he urged Hermann Rieger at the cabin input of Hamburg's stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacubes, the rest time ended, and most of the presents were again on their sites.
Rieger was almost for three decades of the HSV physiotherapeutic, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who were a part of the group.
Therefore, his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant trainer, had his head and lifted his fingers in a seat signal.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's main trainer.
His order was the same: Wow, the second gol!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all pleasant to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard also wanted to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petová (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that Gladbach's very weak team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"It was a sweet victory," said Martin Jol summary.
This Monday, Hamburg's SV will fulfil its 121 years.
On the Sabbath, the spectators had already feasted their own, the heaven to ○ on the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
Previously, part qualifications in the table correspond more to the liga's speed than to the domination of its HSV.
The kipo with its forced players late like the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the goleader Petsen as well as Jansen who has been removed from FC Bayern needs time to join, but the kipo can still not handle with its success.
"We need more than feeling and dribbling," Jol requests.

Dark material affects the traictory of space sons
Since many years, a mysterious phenomenon causes the discovery to researchers: The Dark Material has affected the speed of space songs during the so-called gravitational assistance to the manubre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The "Ulysses" spatial sondae spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel tuberculosis are healed now threatenes you to die in cold.
A mysterious phenomenon for years ago, anomalia during the gravitative assistance to the handicap causes the disagreement among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maniop of the traictory of space sons while they get an acceleration using the gravitative field energy of a planet, for example the Earth.
This allows space songs to cover fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space sondae used this physical truck as did the sun-Ulysses sondae.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as it is expected is the venerable law of gravity.
Increasingly often speed irregularities.
Improvibly the songs have greater or less speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now .
It was called anomalia during the gravitative assistance to the man.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the General Theory of Albert Einstein's Relativeness, which describes the force of attraction of the material for the space curvature, cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the physician and § of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton, thinks solemnly now as before Einstein did not confund and explain anomalia during the gravitative assistance with the so-called Dark Materia, where the astronomes remained in the universe.
"The reason for anomalia may be the Dark Material that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of Dark Material only for ten years.
It probably has the attractive force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Material is, in contrast, completely in日 what does mean that it does not send and refresh any electrical radiation, especially no light.
The estimates of the science are calculated by the Dark Material are at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists in Egypt are free
As the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed, after ten days in the hands of sequestrators, the tourists in Egypt must be released.
Sudan sequencers had a million of the redemption.
Six sequestrators must be killed in a tyroteo during the release.
Five Germans are severed in the south of Egypt.
The negotiations on the rescue have already been started.
Germans always fall on the point of attention of the sequestrators.
The WE ONLINE magazine relates to the most important cases.
It seems that European tourists in Sahara are free.
The same information provides the state-Egyptian television, the arabic Al-Arabija television and the Italian communications media.
After the news about the release in the Italian Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister for External Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our companions and other rehens are free.
'Now we control your health status,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reporting the state-Egyptian TV.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the wilderness are on the road to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reasons for a tyroteo before the release of the rehenes: The descriptions of a Egyptian security guard were ready to end the sequestre, but the Sudan army suddenly killed six sequestrators.
"The problem was resolved.
They were in line with the ransom," said the guardian.
It was just to "receive the rehens" when he suddenly arrived "this surprise".
On Sunday, the Sudan soldiers have killed six sequestrators and two of them have been arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The sequencers have made from Germany the redemption for six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the rehens.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" replied to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the sequestrators were afraid of their security.
The report is reported by the sequencers intended to release female rehenes after receiving the redemption.
The men had to be arrested until the sequestrators had a safe way to flee.
The German ambassador in Cairo 日 take the position regarding this report.
"Suicide Leaved" parental abuse
The court is held, years of abuse for his father took a woman to kill themselves.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old from Stithians in Cornwall, was sentenced to five years of prison after accepting eight offences.
The Royal Court of Truro, at a investigation study, knew that he had regularly joined his daughter Stephanie Randle when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court recognized that Mrs Randle was suicide in her home in Mutley in Plymouth, 1 April 2007, at 34 years of age.
At the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to join her and sell her eyes before taking her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court recognized that Mrs Randle, who used a lot of his time working as a voluntary for the National Trust, was disappointed by the abuse he had been involved twice a week.
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife refered to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfist and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "rejected life".
In April 2007 his true father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in its apartment of Plymouth.
Mrs Rande should have killed herself with a plastic box.
Mr. Randle replied to his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that was concluded, saying, "I'm just cutting her and swinging her eyes.
He's never been a sexual attack.
I feel responsible for your death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetichist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when she was only seven years old.
This unappreciate saga ends with the victim is removed from his own life.
More clearly, it is that if she hadn't done it, the question would probably not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I noted the effect that the description made by the father and Stephanie's mother was abused over her daughter for the years.
she could have had a promised, successful and happy future."
A official loaded by data loss
The BBC was informed that a officer of the Office who had given some secret documents on the train in June will be accused of the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a travel by the Defence Minister, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is probably the less serious burden in law and it does not provide any indication of the intention of crime.
The BBC responsible for the Defence Frank Gardner reported that the sentence had come as a surprise for many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal issue between the Defence Minister and the Bureau," he said.
The employee, which cannot be appointed, is loaded under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause related to the protection of the information.
The Real Justice stated that the officer should be accused of the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive work of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
The documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately after his home to a secret place.
Building companies have the B&B price
In Britain, building companies could be acquired at a price of more than 80 thousand pounds of stars after the redemption/salving of Bradford and Bingley.
The Government, in fact, provided 14 billion dollars to protect the depths of the 2.6 million depourers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies who use the money of the loans, including the 59 building companies.
The Director-General for Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "human" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, 14 billion loan should be refunded after Bradford and Bingley's hypoteques are rescued.
However, the interests in the interior are charged each year to the 700 financial undertakings holding deposits.
The Financial Services Funding Plan confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions who have behaved with humility ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less responsible.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It means that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will increase to 450 thousand pounds of sterling pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds of sterling in order to acquire the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, declared to the BBC that this situation is injust.
"It is humiliating that institutions who have behaved in the growth of the immobile market are called to pay the price produced by those who have been much less than responsibility."
The BSA is held, there are no data that indicate the failure of any company since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the next weeks to find out what options there are to protect the building society and its members against what could be a relevant price," Mr. Cole appealed.
The interest returned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest, which may be almost two times more.
Since building companies are mutually organized and have no employment, their members will end ineviting you by paying the price, either greater rate or lower interests in their wages.
The price of milk ascends from five pens per litre
The inhabitants of Jersey's road will have to pay more for their milk.
The newspaper Jersey Dairy announced that the highest price of milk products will increase by a additional five pens the litre from the next Monday.
It is the second increase in the price of this year, after an increase in two pensions in February and after the investigations carried out by a consultative company.
Tradeholders may decide themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Rejected freedom under confidence to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court of Bangladesh has increased the request for the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that it can be led to prison when she returned to her country.
His defendants said that the court did not grant him the freedom of 50 million tax extortion ($ 729.700) to a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various accusations of corruption to your charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next weeks, but his party, the Awami Liga, has said that the government of the country, supported militaryly, is first full of freedom.
The responsibles say that while the freedom was given to the foreigner to get medical treatments, it is not clear now what the terms of its release are or if it will be able to stay free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that they will make an appointment to the Supreme Court against the Order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court of Justice has requested freedom for Sheikh Hasina, insisting that he could not obtain freedom under confidence because he was already in treatment in the foreigner under conditional freedom," said its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let us interact with a resource against the Order of the Supreme Court."
Her defensors argued that she needed freedom to return to her country from the foreign and prepare for the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his country after 17 October, which a leader of the Awami Liga referred last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, adopted power, but was released in June to go to the foreigner and received medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia have all the charges they are accused.
Fears for the campaign against polyomielitis in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the United Nations - have not been able to use a recent vaccination campaign for anti-poliomielite vaccination due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations have carried out a vaccination programme in six provincies of the country.
The organization reports that children could not arrive in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A United Nations portfolio said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or obstaculated thousands of officers while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB lost legal challenges in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Committee after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the ITV rival of radio distribution.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Apelation that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9% in ITV under 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests prevent competition and allow their disloyal influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought his action package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Anti Monopolio reported that the acquisition of participation in ITV by BSkyB was aware of the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competence Committee to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulators were opposed to purchasing.
BSkyB, recommended that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and was a disproportionate medication, particularly why, said BSkyB, would have granted its voting rights.
New research in the adoption of statunidens lawyers
The United States General Prosecutor has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the exhibition of nine statunidens lawyers in 2006.
The reason was that the General Inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the action by the administration officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, the legislators and the former Manufacturer-General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
The Special Provider Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the employees in question during the investigation have lying to researchers in order to prevent justice.
"G's claims of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or solved," General Prosecutor Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the designation of a special prosecutor with the power to force the witnesses to leave their statements.
The debate comes when nine statunidens lawyers were removed from their charges by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for lower performance.
But later, it was known that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others of their colleagues, and many observers concluded that exemptions would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers concerned had worked in the persecution of some Republicians, high profile members of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate electoral fraud claims against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and condemn the cases of the Government
and can be dispedid at any time, but not removed by political reasons.
The next Chief of the Department of Justice, the General Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the exemptions, rejected its position.
A certain number of other officers of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the General Prosecutor is very critical about the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for the exemptions, which "abdicated" from its position of leadership and was "noblely non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officers, including Karl Rove, the former Bush co-operator, were criticized because they did not cooperate with the research.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honour
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored in the Q Awards for his epic Heaven Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will collect the special premium next week in the ceremonie that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition would be "a honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group is carrying candidatures for the premiums of this year and makes the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-header of the magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that spent time and gender, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, repeat an excellent vocal capacity like that used by Meat Loaf.
A instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hell.
The song was first known as one in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
But Bat Out of Hell of Meat Loaf remained nearly nine years in the classifications and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in the past years, including a surgery operation for its heart arithmy in 2003, after a colapse during a concert.
In 2007, an aguda laringitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later, it happened that he had a kist in his voice.
Dark city road, often lived and maybe ready to sell
The city of New York has thousands of adventure, bullevary, streets and other ways, some famous, others simply serve.
However, many people, including veterinarian taxists and local residents of a long date, are difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and is extended north of the First Calle – before I found the Second Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This silk, more or less than 30 feet width and 120 feet long, is similar to a powdered road more than one active way.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirators.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company who has recently built luxe buildings in the First Calle
that wants to reaviment Extra Place and create a passport to the tents and bottles that are expected to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirators include the old neighbors who commented to be pleased by the truck carrier simply because it is one of the last rest of the block past before the neighborhood of buildings.
However, the Department of Accommodation, Preservation and Development of the city, who has the street control, does not have any interest in possessing it.
In the Committee on the Victimity for the use of the land this month, the representatives of the Avalon Agency made a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, predicting that the street would remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented in the next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community's headquarters, said.
"The city is property today of very few spaces and we would like to continue putting extra Place," Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced a few months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install seats, including some to be used as coffee, in expectation of accommodation of spaces.
The idea Avalon could buy the street came for the first time during this month
but Michael de Milly, a portfolio of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned road and the possibility of converting it into a public area," he said, adding that the sales proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a carrier of the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the Agency's mission was the development of property more than the management of it.
In comparison with its more colored surroundings, the Bowery's, Extra Place has left a floor in the history.
Some believe that he received his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great property finger was divided between his children and this east franja of land was not charged by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the rock monument that closed in 2006, is opened in Extra Place, but the street may be better known by the graphy of the establishment that goes out in the Ramones 'Rocket to Russia' album.
"The environment was magn," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the graphy in November 1976.
"It was filled with bags, clothing pieces and barriels, cartridges, sheets, horns."
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about East Village's insurance, have been opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modesty, must continue to be public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, almost without changes, a race of the city that should be tute.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has provided part of a story of the city's history on Extra Place, published by the New Yorker Journal in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little hard and unusual road, dark also for the day and marked by oxidated and anti-ventane oxided iron storage gates, with old weekly magazines that are split through the channels."
With few episodes, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rate was cut to the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now collected a lush clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and a empty beer bottle of approximately 22-oz were near a new lot of rejected magazines.
Some passengers said that they rarely took attention in Extra Place, but they suggested that you could be given a little.
Mr. Fields noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I've spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humid and ascherous places."
The debate on bilinguism: interest in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilin education.
Lance T. Izumi, an elder associated with studies on the California and the Director of Research Institute for Public Policy, is with the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling effectively to the Spanish voters is a difficult business.
The proposals for education made by Barack Obama are the example of this.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "the African-American and Latin students have significantly less probabilities of graduating than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
In order to combat such differences in the events of the employment, Obama's education plan is particularly aware of, among other things, "balin-traditional education" for the English students.
However, the question open to Mr Obama is whether the commitment of bilin education, which prefers in school education in different languages than English, is effective to cancel distance in the final results.
Let us, for example, take Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognised primary school in the east region of Los Angeles Condado.
At this school, the large majority of students are Spanish and family with low rent:
More than one third of the students, many of whom recently arrived, are in the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of the fourth year students has been positively evaluated in the 2008 Mathematics review.
and almost a surprising 93 percent has dominated the English and Art test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, constant evaluation of competences and does not tolerate any excuse.
In addition, and here Mr Obama should note, in accordance with Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Calle, the approach of the School for the Instruction of English to the students is in the "total interest".
Intrusion in English means almost use of language in the treatment of the instruction content.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to the bilin education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students like this last that has come from Mexico and that if you enter the school 12 months later you wouldn't be able to collect what it was."
"Function," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to repeat by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of their party on education (the National Education Associations have been long-term defenders of the balanced education) and their constant support to the balanced education is dark to predict Mr Obama's response.
Although the immigrants must have English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the question by allowing people to stop worrying about the legislation which is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to improve the system and closure the laguns, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, more than from them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls brushfully after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil is drasticly reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American redemption plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Gross oil action decreased from 7 percent, reaching the barrile at the morning negotiation in New York Mercantile Exchange, 99.80 dollars.
The price has decreased over 20 dollars per barrile since Monday past.
In the last two weeks, the markets of basic products have been shocked by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful Uracans in the Golf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145,29 per barrile in July, the prices had fallen almost $90 per barrile at the beginning of this month, before returning, again, due to the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety was emphasized by the investors once on Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress they said had reached a agreement during the weekend on the highest redemption plan in the history.
The news was shaken by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far away from ending.
The evolution in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's operations, which the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European Fortis financial conglomeration.
The Barclays Capital analystes said, at the weekend, the negotiations that led to the ransom agreement "seemed not to have reactivated the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation is deteriorated, it is expected to decrease the request for basic products, including oil.
"The perspectives for world equity, interest and exchange rate will be more uncertain," the Deutsche Bank analystes wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape from this account.
From the prospect of products, our most accurate concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will be spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Analysis of the economy has reduced its expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption because of the crisis in economic growth and the predictment of the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second quarter of foolishness: team sets record
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things were developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a deinflation game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis commented.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Cardinal Ars had been played with perishing under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point, the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a half of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect preagging for a afternoon, where the relationship development between players had a big step towards it.
Favre found Coles for two more meters in the room, one of them when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre from all the steps they went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been big, independent of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were in prison, the defence of the Cardinals was misleading to the quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking tiro and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric wanted another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was committed to the lack of Warner.
In the last turn, the missing obliged by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken the property with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard patrol to win a final 34-0.
It's the bigger points that the Jets never did in a room.
To the team trainer, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the crazy at this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the territory.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Release beauty encamps its world record
Once again, Haile Gebsselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated that many view it as the biggest corridor of the history, overwhelming its own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and become the first person able to run the carrier of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the hall carrier at 2:03:59, Gebsellassie has destroyed its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebsselassie has established the world record number 26 in a career of an impressive length, so he has established a world campaign or a global record for any distance, from the contrarreloj career to the marathon.
Last month, Gebsselassie has not participated in the olympical marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps in a too alarmant way, in retrospective - that air pollution will engrave its problems with asma.
Instead, he was pointed to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunset and 48 degrees at the beginning of the career, 55 degrees at the end - Gebsselassie won this Sunday, using in the mean term about 4 minutes 43 seconds per milk.
Since the trailers such as Gebsselassie and Paul Tergat de Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last de_, since Ronaldo da Costa de Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebsselassie said to the journalists who had suffered disasters in the pantorrilla two weeks ago and had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left you fresh, not oxidated.
"I'm very happy," Gebsselassie said to the journalists.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything was good."
The athlete has been subject to some critics - especially in Kenya, the African-East Rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating their careers, generally, avoiding meet with many stars of the world marathon, is based on the marks as if it was a career track, and put the records in front of the sense of competition.
But this critical does not decrease the size of the ability of Gebsselassie as a corridor.
This Sunday, at the walk of four Kenyans, Gebsellassie reached half of the career at 1:02:04.
Two elite corridors of Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebsselassia after their marks were decreased.
But soon before three miles from the meta, Gebsellasse took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who ends second at 2:05:36, enhancing his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi came to the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, but now German citizen, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record at 2:15:25.
The early past, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in the Beijing Games so it was described as a loss on the back, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best personal record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon that was running.
He made a smart calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenia and Ethiops to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Cyprus of Kenya finali at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, proudness and tests of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of the Great Orlando, at few kilometers from the city, rude and colosal, there is a quiet people, where the proud and complications of African experience remain very clear.
Eatonville, the first city totally inhabited by black in the country and the place of the infant of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer so simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good naitors, many guayabes, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a peregrination place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Year Zora! Feria in Eatonville to tax Ms. Hurston, the most spectacular writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the Florida Travel Leader produced by the Federal Scriptural Project of the Depression Sea - is still a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the years ‘30, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that the rural blacks in Florida often resisted to keep their true ideas with the white man, that "they know so little about us and that they don't know what it's going to lose."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many are still cautious to the foreigner.
"We are very cautious about how our story is recorded," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of the entire life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"He must be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a triunph and fighting paradox.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black and a community of nearly 2.400 people living under a double level of poverty of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the Southern rural culture - sometimes awarded, other loving - that was born of slavery in America.
It's not strange if those who live here are proud and reserved at the same time.
And anxiety about the image of Eatonville really empires for Zora, as here no one calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her native city to the world to its deep books in dialect like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's leadership transformed the city, only out of the Road 17, a road running from the centre of Florida often inside the history of black and human drama.
With ciment face both in the life and in the life, Mrs. Hurston brought her readers to the property tent of the first master of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then in more private areas.
"From the road to the left hand," he wrote, " there is the modern public school maron with its white finished, its well-keeping gardens and game partys, careful for Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also refers to the new husband of Dash widow and writes that Glenn Lee "sell drinks of any kind and everything goes with transitional rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to the autonomous government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Shora she described it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortal was quoting men who were singing songs without color about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a living excentric that often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, he did it without prejudice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and carrying bags in a city that still is proud of clothing dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were sarcasticly laughing.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," followed Mr. Franklin.
But, added, it balanced in her chair in a back party with view on the Sable Lake, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, " she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer printed.
As most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have seen it.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman at the Barnard College in the years ’20, it was buried in an anonymous tube in Fort Pierce - Florida, where it was living.
In Eatonville there were no large memorandum ceremonies, nor large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrappad in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn reached in the 1980 ’ s.
The officers of the Orange County wanted to put a five-way road from the city to subscribe to Kennedy Boulevard, the road of two main carriers of the work community.
The expansion of the area of Orlando had already emphasized the Interstatal 4 to ≥ the west border of the city.
The proposal arrived at a moment when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended to him idiomatic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the fight for racial mixture led hatred to the community.
"In that season, a group of white chicks, went through the city with narrows and everything against people who were sitting around," Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him against a car sandwich."
In a letter of 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the journal The Orlando Sentinel, criticating the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "instead of honoring my race."
R The residents today say that the discretion of schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened Eatonville cohesion and undermined the confidence of their youths.
"The black kids were used to be abrazed - I agree this - it was used to cover the teacher morning and night," N.Y. Nath, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, an unfinished organization.
This was, added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wouldn't blame your teacher because she was white - there's a cultural break there," said Mrs. Nath.
Civil rights, however, helped to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over the eggs, as she did, with boldness, confidence and lines such as: "How can anyone refuse my company's pleasure to himself!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tube of Mrs. Hurston and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a biografic acclamation of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, re-producing it into the American canons.
The road project reached right at the time the most tragic daughter of Eatonville was again under the reflectors.
And this time, the old neighbors of Mrs. Hurston saw her as a saver.
In 1988, the community comes to plan a feast for Mrs. Hurston to show what the conduit could destroy with that road.
Thousands of admirators arrived to the inevitable event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the consequence has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road at five ways would have been putting on what you would call curvature speed, a real civil proud," said Mrs. Nath.
Mrs. Boyd said it simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People out of the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National History Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a reavimentated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomalia in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, you may sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a soil rain, in a small city as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come seeking the history of Eatonville, of their meaning, are often still carefully treated.
A preliminary permission is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men who work in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has deficiency for the red, are still afraid that his island community can be misinterpreted.
Yet, as the Hurston Festival has extended, there has also been a greater level of national proudness.
Youths, particularly, are tending to see Eatonville as Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, work, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civil sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's neighbor, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who has planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work at the local government or by the Department of Police, which he said he could need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two of the 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have described Eatonville properly.
"The majority of people, if they are attracted to go to here, they will have to think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," said Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very pleasant city."
Here, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed far away from the kioscos and the gigantic television screens in Times Square, they would not be seen in the eye of the Uracan.
They could never imagine that behind the glass fabric of the knife offices located above their heads, bankers and spectacular fund managers that monopolize New York are diarious with the worst "day of the office" since the 1929 bathroom.
Children for the delivery to house continue to resume their metal cars for the tea to the stairs and carry out muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin men are still arranging between buildings of charged apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 excentric printing trucks attached to a yugo to their necks. The officers still wait for their food to take from the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon in the working days.
However, employees are waiting for their bagel to the sales cars, and it is impossible to find a taxi between the four and the five of the afternoon in the days of the week.
I looked like there was no crisis absolutely, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimist previsions that exist, I decided to open a new account of deficiencies.
Although I had calculated the time necessary for the operation to match the peace of the end of the afternoon at my local office of JP Morgan Chase, a school of more or at least 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the worker's window, to recover its efficiency or to make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service, where all life clients order their checks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large storages and new customers want to open their accounts.
The majority of these people told me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal trust banker", and they were at school for the same reason as I am.
In contrast with me, they have already removed their reliefs from the smallest ones in places from where they had conmutated them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the State Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called award associations (a little like a building company), from the credit unions, and from the boxes of departure of their national city whose chairs only work within the state of property, and who say to treat customers as their family.
Last year, 15 of these have failed quietly.
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion assets, entered in the cheap, and as the Neo-Yorkins were driven to their homes on Friday night for the end of the week, another, Wachovia, with some 440 billion depths, he was looking for a redemptor.
The workers of the offices and tents that remained before me, fearing another collapsus, were transfering their money to a safe resource, which is the most of the redemptions on Wall Street.
New York's persons have become financial experts in the last weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on a phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failure, and his distressed executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were complained about the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, fifty-five and something I've conserved in uniform to my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my buyes at the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the country, that "now I have all my benefits in the funds of the monetary market.
The conmutation is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tubes profane at the time Austria approaches the de
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left side of the extreme party for the freedom of Austria and Philip Dewinter Belgian, attended to the extreme party of Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to present the organization "Citents against Islamisation" in Amberes on Thursday 17 January 2008.
There are trade signals that represent the mixtures with a red line that translates.
The police is guilty of extremists for profaning a Muslim cementary in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties of the extreme extreme did great profits in the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tubes were severely damaged in the Traun cementary, near Linz, at some time between Friday night and this morning, where the police believed that it was a organized action.
The criminals broke Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the tubes, but researchers think that this could have occurred because of the intention of hiding the real reasons of extremists impulsed by hate against the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to elections.
A portfolio of the local Islamic Community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of profanation, which came to the Muslim religions when the month Ramadan was going to end.
Meanwhile, Austria will prepare for a round of introspection after the round to the dee in the Parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme parts of the votes, which were nearly 30% of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Association for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on the anti-immigration vehemity and some of their slogans were considered genophobs by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 per cent of the vote, made his campaign against head and burkas, and expressed its opposition to the considered food related to Islam.
At its last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the appearance of Islam.
Both parties are trying to build mixtures and minerals, arguing that they are symbols of the current islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Inquiries and analysis conducted immediately after elections, which have confirmed the extreme of the country as the strongest political block, indicate that the change has occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel in the foreign for Gary Glitter
The courts have held Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star of sexual abuse of children, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges introduced a six months after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain to France.
Kent's police formulated the trip to the foreigner on Thursday after the judges had produced the evidence of the previous sentences of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend audience in the Judge of the Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A portfolio of the Judge Service said: "The Tuesday 25 September at the Judge of the Ashford Magistrates in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's traveling to the foreigner as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities who wanted to travel to the foreigner, being under the register of sexual crimes.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the foreigner for more than three days
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date of seven days of exit.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible place of Glitter's stop in the court.
A police carrier of Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or in the foreign.
A police carrier of Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or in the foreign.
"From our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's people is the main concern of Kent's police and we work in east cooperation to monitor the behaviour of sexual crimes registered in the condeal and to reduce at least any risk that can exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, between 10 and 11 years of age.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow you to passport control and finally fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied the entry and he fled back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted on returning to Great Britain.
He probably arrived to Heathrow 3 Terminal on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrades Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to be registered as sexual criminal.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 by the possession of children's abuse images.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui ́th, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was quiet and rejoiced to know that they had made Glitter travel to France and Spain.
"Master outside scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Fotograph
No tacons, no flights, no external traces.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenc, deposed of the concentration in the interpretation to get the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimity, at those moments, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of some hands, disappointed because they are not going out to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-people" changes the theatricity of some places on scene with songs, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the graph collects the specific icongraph of the flamenc from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flamenca Photograph, the exhibition "respects the international importance of the flamenco, more daily", explains the creator, who states that "Flamenco-people" "can be people anybody but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical artist images in the scenario.
These people retraced "in the street" are artists of passion, tristeness, joy... capturing the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, there is no need to take photos from the scenario.
They take their personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to catch with the camera the personality of the majors of the flamenco."
With the sabor of the festival "Sant de les Minas", Bauer empe · in 1.997 a long journey to travel to the songs, guitarists or dancers with a cart camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and material, correspond to the classic graphy.
The application of various stylistic media breaks with the classic base of the image, confidently modernity, idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolutes and surrounds every day."
It is not the action of dance, song or touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captures with its art to the public.
The search of a meeting with the essence, with the dude that is made in a way of feeling, being and being and have been the constant of this work presented in the El Fotomata gallery these days.
Known figures of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Friend, among others, configure this selection of almost seven photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of the flamenc, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits expressed in the sample.
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Sportart Projects of Veterinary Sports".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the dictionary admits that "I love to trace people, to meet them and to enter an instinctive in their life, whether a long or short instance.
I think the portrait is the most difficult type within the graphics.
You find yourself or you're with people, persons, sometimes you don't know, or they leave you just a few minutes to get the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as ́official, I always try to make my ideas real."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, which leads by the title "Flamenco-people", is shown in the Galeria El Fotomata, which is held at 20 of the Street of Mata, parallel to the Aameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the news that writes is "a fear"
It is enhanced in places that it still doesn't know and turn on unknown matters, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa's attempt to take the new project in which he works, a novel who has a protagonist to Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorable to the Nobel Price of Literature admitted yesterday in its step by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that you today are occupied "is a fear" and that "all indicates that you should not write" the news.
"If I was smart, I wouldn't, but I'm gonna do it and I hope to finish it once," he concluded in its intervention at the exchange feast of ideas, thoughts and words that you have seen passed through the city of Acueducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the dogs" was one of the figures of these figures of the third and of the feast of the word and fulfilled the prophecy.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the premium Hay Festival for being the most voted writer of the participants - an old and "Our mutual friend" of Dickens-, filled the forest of the theater Juan Bravo.
Present by Félix Romeo, found before himself a public delivered to him who was made very short the time when Peruan, with a wonderful and great memory of humor, repeated how his literary vocation was born in him, resulting from the "extraordinary aventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than what he lived"; how it writes of "disciplined" to supplie his "inspiration failure" with an intense documentation work, correcting and reacting much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas have affected their vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are supported.
The Spanish newsman recognized that "no way" is to measure and know whether the books change life, "but I think that it is a pure entertainment, an efímere experience", underlined Vargas Llosa, who said that this "he has effects" and "the most inconform people", so he asked the writers "no abandon the freedom" and "remember with responsibility" his vocation.
The climate is the festival of Pozoblanco that also remains without regions
The festival of regions that closed the feast of Pozoblanco was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking that the floor of the place was not found in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the road.
The inklemences have been stuck with this festival, since two of their three feasts have finally not been able to celebrate.
The Sabbath was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second road of planned towers.
The cartridge was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Baptista, who were going to be in a Castillblanco cave
So, just on Friday, there was a party.
In him, the triumpher was Daniel Luke, who cut three ears and went out to the necks, after leaveing passes with pleasant and steady.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante salted his two holidays with salutes and one ear, which granted more tendens than his toreo.
Yes, the worst was still the Julie, who passed through the case of Los Llanos without penalty or glory.
In his second tower, after a feet of refreshment, the bronze of a large part of the public was gained.
A control in Álava is running in a carrier with two thousand kilograms of hachisis
Five minus ten of the morning.
Trade control of Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Arminnón (Alava).
Agencies give up the two employees of a car and they run away.
Your load, more than two tons of hachisis, wasn't like to stop.
Agencies persecuted and stopped one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., was informed in a communication by the Department of Interior of the Vasco Government.
The arrested person has been accused of trafficking of drugs and public documentation.
The incident was registered when several officials of the Alava Trade Unit conducted a transport control in N-1, in their pass through the municipal term of Armihon.
They were available to stop a car for their inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, quickly accelerated and checked.
The agents started their persecution until the vehicle stopped a few kilometers later in the arc, while their two occupants were able to flee to the cart for a forest area.
The ertzains finally reached one of them and covered from the 2.178 kg of hachis that they transported and found after inspecting the car, a Iveco Daily.
The back part of the vehicle was loaded of hachis, so it was transferred to police dependencies for an exhaustive and weight inspection of drugs.
Furthermore, the officers checked that the registration had been "--" because it did not match the collection in the documentation of the furniture, so it was also imposed on an arrested crime of public documentation.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate for the detention of another suspicious, who has been able to escape to the career as it was said, and to determine the outcome of drugs.
The detention, A. A. J. of 28 years, was postponed to police dependencies in order to perform the relevant diligences and will be sent to justice in the next hours.
Stop Heather Locklear actriz by conducting under the effects of some medicine
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for conducting under the effects of some medicine.
A test has seen to perform strange hands when they are out of their parking in Montecito, has been revealed in the magazine People a carrier from the California road patrol.
The test has detailed that about 16.30 hours, Locklear "was walking down the accelerator, making a lot of sound, taking out the car from the parking back and back, and walking back passed several times above its sun-shirts."
Shortly later, the testimony, which, as the beginning, did not recognize the actriz, saw that Locklear stopped in a nearby bus and went out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actriz sitting inside his vehicle, which was partly blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents brought it to the specialized centre of drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
A police carrier has been shown co-operative and alcohol has been rejected since the first time, although "the officers were first observed, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspicious of conducting under the effects of any substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at 19:00 a.m. although she was in freedom for a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear went out of an Aranna treatment clinic where it was recovered from an anxiety and depression episode.
Calls urges the U.S. Federation to take their competence in the case of Silva
The IU General Coordinator and Member of the United Iceland, Gaspar Llamazares, has assured today that it will be the regional Federation of training that will take a decision on the case of the former Youth Council and Deports of the Assembly of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has spent last week after being accused of conducting family treatments.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and the organization will be the one who must take his competence," he said, "Lamazers on the action that the party must adopt with which he has to be adopted in the Sevillani Constitute.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations on irregularities that Silva could have done: "I always defended that this type of matters should have the maximum level of transparency."
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public charges".
'Sangre de Mayo', the epic appeal of Garci
Inspired in the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recalls the famous rise of Spanish against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious movie in his filming with approximately 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the cinema has “Illy illustrated the torrent of characters and social analysis” that has always wondered in the work of the newist known, has explained today during the presentation of the cup, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevar would be before a wide list of interprets.
May Sanger, with a metrage greater than two and a half hours, is stretched this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to become a ministry for Telemadrid for more than four hours of duration.
Great amazing of the Galdós' age, José Luis Garci assured that he had fulfilled this round "a child dream", which should thank the Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community had responsibility to round a memorative circle three years ago for the second centurion of 2 May, something that he accepted always and when the report was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Madrid Community has granted in its entirety constitute for Garci a "single opportunity" to enhance the decorated and appropriate clothing of the portrait of "a atlonded Spain that was wrong by the leader to fight, since the fight for independence led the people to a huge delay with the government of Fernando VII."
But the cinemaist regrets not to have financed such as the Alatriste or the Goya fantasms - more than the double of the Sangre de May - so it has not been able to rotate some placed scenes in a script signed at Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has cooperated almost all his career.
Therefore, the director of Rever to begin, has made it its usual form of work, the scene with the actors, with whom he often tests before the road and those who do not make casting, by looking "humiliant" and considering that "part of the office of the director remains in attending the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry where he works".
Many of the interpreters matching in Sangre de May repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar four times - of whom he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Holywood A ́mia, the own Sangre of May, Seven French bills and the finally selected, the blind girasoles, are not representing a young generation of the Spanish cinema, "that is what to be known", he assured.
With this Garci movie, you don't expect prize.
"In the beginning you think you're working for the posterity, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you're complying with another movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional tragedy.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of Sevillana Dancing Tortola Valencia
A sevillana dancer will also make a sevillane baller.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenz Tortola Ferrer) and mother Andaluza (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana camp and when she was three years old, she moved to London with her family.
It was a free and specialist dance dancing in east dance.
He had a passionate life, a pious of the freedom of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corse that prevented the free female movement.
The life of this woman who marked a Danish and Estatic revolution in Europe of wars fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepaoa and she proposed me this character and seemed incredible."
It's the dancer, "we're not going to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of your dance have suggested me the flamench's fats.
So, "the dance of the maripose" suggested me a guy, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanks.
Your dance was without and to me they told me that my dance is also inside this esthic."
The montage is two-special partnerships: the Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of its spectacles, just as he did in the "Open Gate" and with Master Matilde Coral, who has spontaneously wanted to cooperate with who he was.
"Matilde makes a major Tortola, the character of matureness.
I am happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honest about it."
The mount also relates to the musical and gitarr composite of Jesus Torres and Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Moron; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violation of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal accompanying of this kind of artists who were divorced in all its lusts, and who always walk in love with them."
In the work, the life of this woman that was developed in such remote places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as it was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's of those women who have a huge influence in a given time and now no one knows and is much less worth their work."
The spectacle will start today at 20,30 hours in the Vega Lope theater.
The publication of the "Recently Married Poet Journal" also closes the Trinity
The presentation of the first and illustrated "A Recencased Poeta Daily" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is included within the activities scheduled by the Cultural Board of Andalucia to celebrate the "Trinio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the purpose of remembering the fifty-year-old anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Price of Literature and the loss of both.
In this way, the "Trinio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the ree′ of this work, with the International Congress celebrated in New York, with the restoration of the Museum House of Nobel and with the itheant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light shop", which was incurred last month of May, and that, after traveling through the various andalous provinces, it will be expected to travel to New York during the International Congress.
Moreover, the Culture Council of the Counsel of Andalucia has bought a total of eight hundred exemplars of the "Daily of a Recencased Poeta", published by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal poetes.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is of the Sally Field actriz, who worked with him in "Ascension of evil", and gives the idea of the American cinema department, and of all America, before the impacting idea that Newman has gone.
Look that they costed to give him a Oscar.
And that's been retreated since 2007.
And that I knew it was very stuck.
Still that's been a madness for everyone.
Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expressions, and now I've lost a big friend," Robert Redford wept, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid to make the ridiculous or to overgreat.
A father of the cine and the country was dead at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-estimation of the ground, seeking unexpected reasons for dignity.
When the time is so hard and without men and very few beings to admirate you remain, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was incarnating for everyone a nearly platonic ideal of beauty and reality.
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and defensor of lost and winned causes from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdose to his home and organic food mark.
All a gift to a country who has costed much to overcome a self-suicide food culture.
The expansive valley of Hollywood Barry admiration without taking attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel ́ig, found that he didn't die a man but a era.
Other English, the Oscarized Director Sam Mendes, said to work with Newman was not less than the summary of his career.
The bad boy coming from 日a, Crowe, was attracted to call Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left us the very high list to everyone," George Clooney observed, perhaps one of the little ones today is attracted to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the need of probability and having a serial and remote life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in the media jungle today.
But there's someone, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then he was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when they certainly overcome the opportunities to not be.
"But why am I gonna eat hamburger out of the house, if I've got a ticket inside?", I'm just kidding himself.
In heaven, he was astonished by the proud that his daughters coincide with their fans on earth, something not so common in America.
"From all the great papers he interpreted, no one was so proud as the devoted husband, loving father, unclean grandfather and dedicated philantrop," they say.
The imperfect career of a olympical Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they are celebrated in Madrid a few olimpiades and, after 2012 failure, may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect career called her, and my judgment was the worst career with much I was in.
A colmo of unprojects that, since then, if they consider it as an evaluation and I would examine, would be a very clear suspension.
But we're going through sides and from the beginning.
The unnecessary begins with the collection of the throat, which makes you to go before.
What doesn't seem bad to me, but if they're already making you go to give it all (which's the chip to avoid knifes in the car).
No, no, no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the throat (earlier unforgettable, go only to it) and (after the relevant school), surprise!, there was only a row 'S' for the cup (second illness, because I need a XL rate)
In what world do we live?
Or have you decided to buy only small shoes with less screens and more beautiful?
Well, things like these are a little bit compared to the day of the career.
Besides having to go very quickly to pick up the chip, the school at the arrival is 15 minutes and also, you have to leave the mochila.
More than 35 minutes was waiting, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11.000 people are expected.
So, as it was to wait, empe_the career and we haven't left the mochila yet, though once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
Furthermore, the rain amene’s expectation of more than 40 minutes, which joined with popular rebellion conatus and appealed to the box.
I think about 500 people will certainly have pulmony tomorrow, and some like me, nor will they appear with the right time in the classification because of the chip that they gave me that, I imagine, it didn't mark my output correctly.
Since then, if you asked me about the perfect career, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream with a well-prepared olympical city.
Microsoft Search Recipientist (virtual)
At the MIT Emergency Technology Conference of Microsoft has shown a progress of a new image recognition system and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intellectuality but able to perform some basic tasks, such as requesting a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the campus of the company) by listening to what the conversation hears.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they take - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Grouping the currents is also the discussion groups.
In the sample video, the recipient detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to it and that it is not a employer of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and says he'll take care of him soon.
Everything without screenshot to.
Impressionant.
But that's, of course, the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of your operational system, Windows.
This week has been very talked over a change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many programs associated.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers arise with the impressive instead of loading commercial basury, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be at least.
All one finding note that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "external" to Windows.
The change of road is thankful.
Microsfot has right, the operational system will lose importance, and also software.
When Google Chrome went out to the network, it was one of those who were summarized to the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many mentioned accurately that a browser is not a operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the incredible layer to understand the Hardware and Software.
Complete the same role as your wife or your husband when you have to tell your grandmother something.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but we need to think of the "dead" of the operational system, not as a absolute truth but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People always give less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spent more time every day by navigating than in the window environment.
For what are the half of the applications coming in the system?
At least it's more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less, than View.
Less heavy, less reloaded, less completed.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating your online services and they are finally an alternative to Google.
They need it unexpectedly, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post took it in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of a month.
In the refrigerator machine, a cartel asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the network.
Last week, truly, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come to the beginning of 2009 but to the end, rather to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly search for the Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to take place.
The Fabuloso Marcel
Paul Picasso was carrying her at Costa A日, Caprioo lighted one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of blood', the same as Al ́ino in 'El Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola and forms part of the uniform of the gay muscular park.
And if we get to number star appearances, we can go back to the image of that pointigud bigote force that lifted up weight in a ambulant cycle.
In essence, it's not more than the typical inner masculine bottle in cowboy, cheese, and without manga.
The 'tank', which calls the English speaking, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels declines over all others.
First, by his rebombing name - even though it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which you have to do with the deport because it receives its name, it is accounted for the legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loves the song Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' highlights the other by its excellent cotton, by its unisex court, by its distinctive escudo and by the small Belgian flag (only recognible) that the most embryo patterns carry out as detail in the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian signature is not only focused on its top tanks.
It also includes sudaries college, back boxers, cashmer cards, cocktails, marine trucks, babies, mini shorts...
Take thoughts for underwear comfort.
Although it's a pen to leave them as an internal clothes.
They're too nice.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't care about me."
Her enormous similar to her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica is often but full of vitality.
Now the sisters are very seriously taking their new activity in mode.
For Monica, they're much more than some beautiful and famous girls who provide their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion of the signature of Mango in its new seat, as well as the presentation of the most important model premiums than the Spanish house sponsorizes.
Silent and tired, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection we have idead my sister Penélope and I to Mango at this new winter-session, as well as assisting the presentation of the second and dictionary of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
On what is your new collection based for Mango at this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister as well as me loves the movie of the 50s and 60s; we have taken many references.
Then, I like very much for a city and observe women as they dress, as they combinate and mix their clothes, I do much.
Bailarin, actor and design, you're a very polyfactic woman, right?
I think yes, but at the end, it's all together and they have a lot of links in common.
I liked my clothes from a little while; I wanted to go home to my grandmother to shoot in the armies of my tante and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attractions park.
Then, of the dancer, I always tried to care about how I was clothing.
You know that the dancers like us to make our stylisms for classs and tests, to look at us at the speech and feel good.
And in the actor's paper when they give you the clothes is when you really find the person.
So, everything is united, yes, with great respect to designers and professionality.
You've been fulfilled not long ago at the 30th, have you been in crisis?
What's going on.
I feel better than never, I like 30.
I find that the woman is done, has experience, and she has saved life with less errors.
To me, the biological clock doesn't give me them.
I did the things I wanted from a little while, and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, are you thinking to be a mother or not?
Since then, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me and I want to be a young mother; this is not my desire.
I don't care about the candidate.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with love.
As regards the movie, you're stuck from a number of streens you surrounded last year.
That's what I already want you to see the light.
I, that I am a woman coming from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I want everything to be clearly, it can't be.
I'm pleased to train "The last hour" and "Search for Christ's Tube".
Seeing that they look like...
A few days ago you've been debugging on a passager with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going up to a passport to make a model.
Simplely, Naomi Campbell called me, whom I have already known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial defil for his organization 'Wellow for a better world' and the clothing we showed - I took two pieces from our collection to Mango - it was up to recover money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that Naomi's tired heart.
There's so many things about her that, I and I know her, I would tell you that many are not sure.
Moreover, I'm staying with that part so good that she's involved.
He asked me to roll for a so noble cause, but if I came to ask me to do the pine, because I also.
For the benefit of women in the third world, what is needed.
Reciprocal alcoholic drivers must install the 'alcohol'
Internally, the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholism should install in his vehicle a system that prevents the dry vehicle from dragging, or if it does not surface.
The initiative has already been announced last June and now is already included in the annual memory of the State General Fisheries, which is a pilot project which will take a period of one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so this will also receive a vial re-education course.
In the experience, besides the Vial Safety General Office, they will participate in the Directorate-General of Trade (DGT) and the Technological Institution Fund for Car Safety (FITSA).
Statistics are set up, between 30% and 75% of the cars declared more than once by driveing beer, take the car again.
Alcohol would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in spirated air and prevents the car to be cut off if the driver doesn't shoot abches; or when a alcohol concentration is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is greater than 1000 euros and would run by the sanction.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduced crimes to 65% during the first year of implantation.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save life to 115 people every year.
The measure is attached to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to cope with these behaviors before they occur in criminal crimes.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be made by means of a legal way, and, however, the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in a organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial vehicles and public services.
Exactly tomorrow, the Congress of the Members will vote tomorrow to a PSOE initiative in which this system is proposed to be installed in school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With britannical puntuality at 17.40 p.m., the time set out in the programme, he landed at the presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez of Mexico DF, the Spanish Air Force airport in which the Princes of Asturia traveled.
The sun was departed, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a turn to see the real couple descending from the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours ago I had asked the street, to the taxist, if I knew that the Spanish Princes visited the city to formalize an official trip.
Oh, very good, then you can't go to the port to load that hour... she's from here or so...
- No, sir, she's Spanish but she lived here for a few years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican pressure knows very well who are the Princes of Asturia and the importance of the travel.
Many are waiting for the hangar of the port attached to the red lamp and a military valley formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honors.
The Prince appears smileful, dressed with a marine, and she, Princesa, melena to the wind, very soft, doesn't use her habitual "peep-toes", perhaps had communicated her that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a squeet stopped to the dictionarys before they go to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the gate of the hotel where they are located, one of the four majors of the city, expects a diaracher of the Mexican TV reporter.
The best given premium of the mode
Perhaps there is no place in the world's closest to present a mode premium, which Paris and perhaps there is no more exquisite and good designer living than Valentino.
Mango just presented the second and .. of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international projection of the new mode talents.
It's charged with a premium of EUR 3000,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first, looked at its designs in Mango's escape in the 54th of Paris's Haussmann Boulevard and almost weeped from the emotion.
Indeed, it is the second largest tent of the signature in Europe and it has just been incurred with 1.335 square metres of surface.
The first is in London.
So many aggressions, united to the desire to thank the designer Valentino that was presiding the jury of the claim, made us end at a luxe dinner in the opera Garnier of Paris.
With the neighborhood of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart departed of penny and doing trips of heart, by the recent disappearance of his brother, put a cart of the House and some addresses of ELAH, which cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a canon of almost two meters of length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his home dinner.
Andik, owner and master of Mango, did the honors and he is so gentlemen that I ended, at the baron of Roøjil, without cake, because they both had been delivered to two ladies.
Monica ́z, who came to the tent with bottles and bags - of own design - and for the dinner, transformed with a six-long black clothes, was when in the night passed by the oper, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, took up one of the bars and made a hiding of 'ground plue'.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the pass by the dependences of the palace, but he taught us at the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we could enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canon that moves on a motor - and by John Traō, who arrived to Paris's intercontinental hotel, with his Sabanas, his toilets and requested before, that there were no guardians in his room.
Stars under the stared heaven of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to view the caotic and frenetic daily life.
And for a little time, all are gathered in a book that will bring relax to the libraries on September 30.
The wakeman is almost punishing when it sounds every morning at 7 of the morning, but it is still worse to imagine in the agitated rythm that imposes the current life.
The office is called pressure and the back pain computer.
Stress is the bad of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily disconnection and disconnection problems with the work world.
No, the number comes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 100
At the margin of the yoga positions, the classic massage or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book all a 'menu' of opportunities adapted to the pleasure and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or a ≥ personal relations, this 'manual' demands such faith.
Furthermore, it offers other procedures such as to be in contact with nature or recepts of 100% of nature that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenalina no longer runs through your venas to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the sofa, distract your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk sleeping
Some kids talk about the night.
I do not mean those who are very disappointed tell us something that has happened on the previous day, but children who speak sleeping.
The first time it happens to the best you take a sust, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a good change in the dream that is called dreams.
It's very common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one have told you that he talked about the night.
This phenomenon can appear very spontaneously (one time in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodic (all days, once a week, once in months...), the child does not repeat anything next day.
There is no unique cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other changes of dream such as weaknesses, night terrors, night enuresis (slaughter) or sonambulism, but it doesn't have to be like this.
As we have mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever tables, stress-free or overexcitation.
In any way, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tonne of voice, slow words, a murmure or anything contrary (scream, swimming, long talks...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, the child should be observed and consulted with a specialist, to check whether there is a question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives it out of this way.
We have said that it is a goodly change, so it does not have treatment, unless it is associated with another change of dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with a dream apnea or a stress table).
What you can do is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the kid much before go to sleep.
So seek quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are fearful or a little violent.
With very nervous children and which costs them to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them buy a certain internal calm.
This will please that the child can have a more quiet dream.
Once the dreams appear, keep calm.
Remember that they are innocent for the child and that the next day you will not remember anything of what happened.
Benefit Councils
Don't wake it up.
It is inutile, for he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's relaxing.
Remember that if it is shown very troubled during several episodes, it would be appropriate to consult or find out what is that generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (what is not the most usual), do not fall in trying to make you a questionnaire to dismiss your information.
You won't get anything, because when you're sleeping, you're not aware of how to organize your thinking.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming to say that, so much care about how you interpret the information and the conclusions you're getting out.
You never tell the kid that you can ask him about the night to know his secrets.
You don't have a shit.
That generates much anxiety.
In summary, don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's an episode that takes only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of the victory in its field after a long period of escape.
Without having done a good game, the team created many times of gol and was able to make a gol to win the game.
The rythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty to express themselves.
After a first temptation of Captain Kauffmann, who rose the square with a remote tyre, Illhaeusern was going to take the "power" and by a remote Funderflick turn, then with Hirn up, Romein with the foot point or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we didn't stop crossing the center campaign and just left Riahi in appeal position.
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Riahi and Temporary for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Ilhousiens with the Marais gol, well-being to collect the ballon in a first tentative of Diebold (53 ').
But the guleator Illhousiens can't spend much time his happiness and will be forced to return to the guards a dozen minutes later and thus leave his team companions in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not use the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven ilhousians who returned a little back to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a significant pharmaceutical, the ballon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishers
Before switching to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a round to British.
With regard to the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who intensely disturbed the entries of several British and normal gates on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the Gate of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to find its representatives there.
These promised to take it " with a construction spirit " and they hope " to come with specific proposals "
This presidential visit coincides with the General Joint of the " Crisis Committee " established by British fisheries to achieve measures against the increase in gasoline prices, which marks a record at achieving EUR 1.14 per liter.
The portfolio of Eliseo David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to rescue and to save the conditions of employment and recompense of mariners. "
Fisheries are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried operations to reduce Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused such attacks of almost 10 km.
The Kiberon Sport Gate has also been locked, but connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the peninsula of Quiberon.
The mariners have already shown on Monday their determination burning, raying the alba, neumatism and wood palettes before the brest gates fuel deposits, and Lorient, while manifestations occurred in Concarneau or Saint-Brie.
The movement was spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the boats stayed at the gate, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishers of La Turball and Crossic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped the blocking of the important refining total of Donges.
Boulogne-sur-Mer fishers decided to wait until this midnight that will take place the ministry to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday in the development of movement and its participation in the meeting provided in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsibility of the national fisheries committee, which did not sustain their movement.
" The village will pro" because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris, for example, Liliane Cariou, the President of the Committee on Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who are not paying taxes on gasoline, currently pay about 50 centimeters per litre but believe that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached with only a gasoline with a price less than EUR 0,30 per litre.

With 228 votes against and 205 against, the representatives refused to the Secretary of the US Treasure Henry Paulson the means he asked.
About two Republicians of each three have made their plan.
"This is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress that cannot adopt a plan ", Lindsey Piegza, of the Financial FTN.
"This shows how much the market had with this plan, "added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days comes "too late."
"If the project is really deadly... the Fed and other central members will quickly take the relevance (the Central American N., the Network N.) to manage the crisis, which would more appreciate the credit conditions, " said Brian Bethune, head of the Economy and Finance of the Global Insight.
And more accentuating the feeling of emergency, " every day it is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza underlined.

Obama, winner during the first television pain
At the first debate of Friday between both candidates in the White House, another occurred to know who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign general quarters announced their own victory in this television fate followed by a third of the American families.
The political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not "brilliant bastard" to allow him to break his low in the sonds to five weeks of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose review of the public opinion published last Saturday, grants five advantage points for Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the democrate who went out well.
Among the unexpected electors, which are those who count, Obama went out winner with 39% of the investigated, while 25% of them granted the victory to McCain is a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm its advantage on Thursday with the good expected performance of his member of his own candidature, José Biden, during the first and unique public debate with her rival, Sarah Palin.
" It would be a mistake to subestimate it.
He has good instincts, "before Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventh-year-old McCain showed his inadmissible experience in external policies, underlined the "inhumanity" of his opposer on these issues that were in the heart of this first love.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president " also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican television publications.
Obama underlined that he represented the future.
Without disturbing, it was concise and precise.
Real is its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the picture of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it, " replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republician because he had not considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the e-s. "
"The nineteen minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama claimed yesterday before 20 000 people who had meet for a electoral in North Carolina under a recent rain.
He did not speak the words "medium class" or "workers". "The financial damage is clearly favored by Obama, which is considered as the most able to save the economy that is at the border of the precipicium.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," I loved, yesterday, the influent and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an ancient member of the Clinton Administration, compared the " good economic instincts " of Obama with Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
The democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the end of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Reaffirming that it would be at all to decrease the taxes of 95% of the e-countries despite Wall Street surpluses, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the implementation of a potential energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45 kernel park from here to 2030.
Proudentes, both candidates addressed the issues relating to the financial salvation plan of $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted last afternoon by the Congress and extremely improved.
"In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and or Others showed the last Sunday at the main place of the Belarus capital to pre-ciphere the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of Belarus were gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closure of electoral centres at the Central Place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of legislation.
While no results were yet announced, many young people had come to manifest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " The dictator must be released."
Some recognize that they have not voted: "for what, because they will do what they want with my vote ", says a young man.
They do not believe that the scheme that has made the foreign observers good in order to renew the contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the congelation of certain assets, could be raised if these elections are considered as observators.
It wasn't the opposition.
" We have been placed by the electoral commissions, and our observers could not participate in the votes summary, " complained Jouri Potemkine, the portfolio of the Union of Democracy Forces, a heeterogenic reruption of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, underlined by Alexandre Milinkievitch, an ancient candidate for opposition to the presidential election of 2006, and leader of the European movement, because the importance of the votes is, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some members of opposition enter into Parliament, it is because they will be appointed but not chosen.
" But its entrance to Parliament may mean apparences in television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which has many debts from Russia, comes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we're in danger of being a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It highlights that the numbers of participation seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote with precipient (26% of the electors in Minsk) promoted manipulation.
"Have you noted the elections? Ask the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the two last political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centres.
And there will be at least five members of the opposition to the Parliament, those who agree better with the power. "
The silence of the night comes back on October's place.
In the television, President Loukachenko and members of the Electoral Central Committee are welcomed for their success.
Interview - Sangre is back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Decary, had the right to rejoice because Hema-Quebec was again one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
In particular, he recovered the confidence of the public that was seriously empty by the scandal of polluted blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, national blood reservations administrated by the Hepatitis C blood transfusion Service of Canadian Red has been contaminated by the Human Immunity Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
With regard to this drama and the disapproval of the public, the Government of Canada made in February 1994 a public investigation, presided by Judge Horacio Krever, which intended to explain the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such disaster would not be reproduced anymore.
While Judge Krever was long in presenting his relationship, certain provincies then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provincies and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Quebec eats its activities, nearly 38 per cent of people were still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Decary reports.
The situation was disappointed.
After having made a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years followed, we have recovered the public's confidence, " said proudly that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Quebec population had the successful confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary recalls, however, that " confidence is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of caution.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of human variant of the crack disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which when we don't know and when a serious disease can evacuate it, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterised by a degeneration of the brain that leads inevite to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we rejected the blood of people who have remained more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been demonstrated out of doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of caution that was applied had the meaning. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests that allow to detect the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not the antibodies against the virus, which based on the tests used until now.
Nuclearic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first virus could be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period in a period less than one week.
We so substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements have allowed to decrease the risk of taking aid by blood transfusion.
Today, every 12 million people are risking HIV contaminated blood.
"It means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, more than 24 years before a HIV transmission case is overtaken by a blood product.
I think you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover health without anxiety," Hema-Quebec's address head.
" Our challenge for the next dead is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what patogen could occur in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting that, for example, of the Western Nilo virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly watchful ", follows Dr. Decary before submitting that, in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply.
" Needs increase because the population is older.
As the most aggressive anti-cancerogen treatment of patients often needs a injection of red blood or tablets.
The age of the population has also effects on the network of blood donors that reflects by average only 3% of Quebeques acceptable to the blood donation. "
However, everyone with good health, 18 years old and corresponding to the criteria of admissibility can give blood every 56 days, either six times a year.
In the meantime, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from aid or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where Malaria is ruled, they will be excluded for a period of a year.
" With this 3%, we are able to keep an inventary covering hospital needs.
The pains are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they are older and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is hard to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to be regular donor.
Since the current life is very discharged, we rarely find the time to pass a hour to give your blood ", Francine Decary is disappointed.
With a budget of 297 million dollars annually, Hema-Quebec offers not only blood products but also human weights, including bone injections, heart walls, eyes globes and skin that are almost used for the great burning.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood of the umbilical cordon in Quebec.
The mubilical cordon that anciently was considered biomedicic waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for treatment of serious diseases such as leucemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the place in our thousands of blood samples of the umbilical cordon, and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We should begin to propose it for injection at the beginning of the next year ", needs Dr. Decary who describes this program of cordon blood as very popular.
" Many moms are disappointed that they can't enjoy this, " since Hema-Quebec has no resources to offer this complete and costly programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The Effect on Semifinals
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the semifinal series of the elimination series of the first USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in summary) near the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive part of the final quarter series, in the Saputo Stadium.
The center campaign Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time, the center campaign David Texto and Rocco Plan created many occasions of gol.
Roger Levesque was the only one who distressed Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Remember that during the first party of the series of games, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a damage for 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle's suburb.
The Impact will be measured to the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifial.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the flight party to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps accessed the semifinals for 5-4.
The Impact should be held to Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday next, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Shortly – Kovalev's Victory Gol
The third number one of Canadians is ready to take the season.
The composition unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a winning for 3-2 of the Canadian to the free towers in front of the Panthers of Florida, yesterday night, in the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec collected two aids, and Kovalev collected a step in this profit, the Tricolor quarter in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only gol.
"I'm not ready yet, for the Russian.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play at the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a ovation."
Charest is busy in the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the execution of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general advice of the Liberal Party is completed, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (left) is chosen during the part of today's election.
Reject the limits of our last large north border ": such is the long-term ambition Jean Charest presented with visual force remains in the large lines, at the end of the general advice of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday.
After him, during his speech, images were projected.
They scrolled, in three large screens, spectacular images of embalses, mineral explosion, from Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media such as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this hour, although he has seen that his time is very full.
The North Plan is the fourth side of a "vision" which the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the hand of work with France, a covenant between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been subject to a presentation.
The Prime Minister was limited to explain why the North was " a joy to the great potential " but he did not give a term, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
What may be more developed is: particularly the election, the forest, but, in particular, the mineral sector, the growth of the coming countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains " no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
This " territorie twice large as France " is our house, is in Quebec.
It's not only our home, but it's in us, "he insisted, as to show that he requested a national baser myth.
Quebec was built very much thanks to his relationship with the North, underlined: the ride towards the gold in Abitibi, the Quebec Engineering, the Bahia James.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," added, after having made a theatrical pause to view the large map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebeque territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec always revinded, needed the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line in which they do not agree for a long time and, when the opportunity is present, I repeat that position from the Government. "
Moreover, "with climate changes, we have to reflect on our vision of the North, " he declared about the passport of the Northwest, which will be opened every year because of the ice fun.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupation of the territory is a duty.
What about the residents of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful for them and that the project would benefit them, particularly for young people.
Two ancient ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ancient deputy of the Quebeque Party in Ungava), have already started consultations about 30 communities.
A interministerial committee presided by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has a significant role empe · some jobs.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summary " but a " common vision " in which " will be given.
North development would be made in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respected for the environment, " promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuing one with the first liberal ministers who predicted it.
" Like the liberals who predicted us, we have otherwise thought to transform challenges in new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurrent issues of the weekend, which begins on Friday with a great cocktail to subray the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the power of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rebuild Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adelard-Godbout.
"On Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and nationalization of election, in Bourassa, which made the Bahia James our party was able to forget the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he called another reference, that conservation, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the theme of Eastmain1a-Ruper Embalses project, Mr. Charest stressed that its service was planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I intend to be there," he trusted his soldiers, raised applauses.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would not be elections in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not refuse the possibility of launching a vote, which law allows you.
It highlights that its time is yet full, especially because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summary.
The General Council of the End of Week delivered the Liberal Chairman a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: The Liberal Party of Quebec claims in particular to recognize the " Quebec specificity " in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec be named members of the Council of Radio Diffusion and Canadian Telecommunications and that they have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we accept the large lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The Chef of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Government Landry had launched in 2001.
She, the liberal government, reaching the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had done it, "We would have made progress today", Mrs. Marois commented on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote that has been done today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Government Plan.
"But what you want is that this is not just a spectacle," commented leader Sebastien Proulx, in the substitution of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacations today.
Letters - A Deshonoured Land
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister for Justice (Oh irony!) in Harper's office, which was allowed the past summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "vertànce" for Canada.
Deceiving this woman that led an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all western countries involved, who has not repatriated his national that is closed in the concentration field of Guantánamo.
It is a government that does not take into account any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were re-evaluated had occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Gibea Convention, rejects its promise and allows a child to live in unhuman conditions.
The only one who strives with justice was to evaluate the responsibility of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, International Amnisty and the Association of Canadian lawyers, particularly, support the restoration of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a balanced process in Canada.
It is this government who closes the eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult be psychologically devastated, without doubt forever after so many years of exaction.
We have not yet realized that, but we have now assisted an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that he does not have any meaning.
It has already come to the time when no more moral exists: we can maltrate, torture, arbitraryly capture a Canadian citizen as the Governing Boss wants until now minor (what will happen after 14 October?).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that entrusts the Virtude, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government rejected what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews is provoked by this renouncement and nothing else.
Free Opinion - The orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
On 17 September, Levoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, president and director of Canadian Minera Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, Barrick Gold that the largest aurillae company in the world tried to make a six-million euro difamation process against three authors and a small editorial house in order to provoke a transparency public debate.
If it is true that judges are independent and imparcial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in case of persecution by disfamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Why, if Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to damage who is attracting to support a contrary position?
The result of the dispute has little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must expenditure significant amounts in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very desirable weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the bottles almost without the miner.
The tactic, in these desirable fights, is often to destroy the applicants in order to introduce a friendly arrangement that will promote the opposition, as well as to fear who will be attracted to re-examining the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he had to present his vision of facts.
In contrast with what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally done for the change of ideas and not for the shoes of garbage.
It was therefore enough for the mine to open its books, its documents and to establish a real debate to the newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent search equipment that could have explained the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust the public opinion, and he guards the requests and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver probably explain how you can ask for a "public debate" from the opinions of this?
It seems that this word is designed only to the very payable lawyers and not to all the Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, delegates also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, it's that the public that supports the authors and the editors of Northern Canada do it especially because it's the brutal way of mine.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge it, but having a fundamental civilised change of arguments, not in the context of what many people feel as a persecution-mordace (forwarding the " public debate ", Barrick Gold has just made a requirement for the authors of Northern Canada intimide them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal discourse, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against university freedom of search and truth, essential by all democratic society.
Reject the right to cite reliable sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that disappreciate the rich companies of this world in a country such as Canada, under many persecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Northern Canada.
He has a response right.
The university world, in which we belong, has already been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The dismissed persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not like to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to set devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Rescue operation from Wall Street - Democrats and Republicians are agreed
Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, at the time of the Republican and Democratic Republic, finally reached an agreement on the most important economic salvation plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion American dollars that intends to deal with the financial crisis that has been seen in Wall Street for months has to be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular: a better control by the chosen ones of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the invested public money, the new provisions to contain the number of houses in charge of payment, as well as a supervisory right on payments paid to the leaders of the subsidiary companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, last night, at the end of a marathon of negotiations that were two days.
"We have made great progress in view of an agreement that will be effective in the markets ", said the representative of Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to put the economy and the economics and and employment before the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the traumatism, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of the and the lives will be big, " said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been completed very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the humor of investors.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have been reached later to negotiations, were more favorable to the agreement, however, without expressing their disapproval of being obliged to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama gave him certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that would allow the owners to keep their home and the payment of the overliding companies by the State.
" When contributors are asked to take exceptional measures due to some's irresponsibility, they must not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented in the American TV.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, asked in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, answered: " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to do and with which we can progress.
He said the option to do nothing is not acceptable."
The plan of 700 billion is intended to buy with the money of the contributors of doubtful debts, the risk- and inventory assets of the American financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis caused by the extent of an immobiliary bullshit, which led first to the delay of the risk risk credits before extending to other common forms of credit credit (PCAAA) and providing a liquidity congelation and a discharge of the financial institutions and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elections who have made the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe that we have gone out of this commitment since the democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only assured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of cleaning the expectations for everyone at the Congress, we also added a provision that if the Government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new taxes that would want to help him recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, which can be added to 100 billion billion if the President seems necessary.
The payment of other 350 billion would be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will receive shares in assisted companies that will divide you in the case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of delaying the embarrassment procedures relating to residences obtained with immobile loans if this plan is, as well as the fixing limits on remuneration and on metal compensations paid to the leaders of the undertakings affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives from today and to the Senate on the next midnight.
Despite all its efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
The Republican Scott Garrett, member of the camera funding committee, declared to his electors that "with any evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not that consists of bringing profit from the contributors. "
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an encourager of a small group in the Congress, presents the problems in other ways, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economy teachers, among whom three Nobel Prices, wrote us to say: we asked the Congress not to quickly and to examine the way to take, " said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had again the evidence of the world nature of the crisis.
After an urgent responsibility, the three Benelux countries announced the part nationalisation of Fortis group by 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Belgian Governments, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French BNP Paris would notice that he was refusing to buy his competition in cheap since he lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risk-immobiliary loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European and ten largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," said the Netherlands Minister of Finance, Wo ́Bos, yesterday.
Instead, we recover a voting right on the influence and influence.
It's just something that abortors and families will now have when times are uncertain."
This time, on the other hand of Mancha, the British Government seemed to want to nationalize another financial crisis.
In the case of the English press, the government would carry out all loans in Bradford and Bringley and over 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of immobiliary loans.
Spanish Santander noticed yesterday that it would buy the offices and accounts of the British.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second, after Northern Rock, that the British Government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His eyes to eyes represented their triumph for a long time.
Had the American actor with a lovely smile released from his narcissian side?
Yes and not.
His power, his sensitivity, and a talent that was obviously will also have removed him from the record of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But what a big bathroom!
Paul Newman, dead on Friday, at 83 years of age, because of a lung cancer in its Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American cinema icons of the latest years.
It is less phenomenonal than Brando, who seemed very much and has been considered a rival in the movie for a long time, more deeply fragile in his game, but also the apostle of freedom and extent of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes big children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a Jewish father of German and Hungarian origin mother.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without self-measured, last quality mark.
Because in him was projected all a loving country of the self-factor man, the fighter of the war of the war, wounded in the fight, which at the beginning of the 50 ’ s studied the dramatic art in Yale, and then frequented the Actor's actor in New York, before triunning in the theater, in the television and soon in the movie.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot classified in second position in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the Joanne Woodward actor.
The secret sides of this secret, discrete and compromised star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the spectacle that we don't know very well.
He's a honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the films this weekend, while their large roles were played on the black screen of memories.
More than a half centuries of the seventh American art in everlasting change to it.
Many memories return to memory like the cowboy with pleasure of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who makes his unbelieving wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc tissue of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More close to us (1990), we evoked your sensitive Mr Bri ́, disappointed by a marriage that did not comply with all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed through the film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, murdered, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hate), of Robert Wise, a role assigned to James Dean, repeated after his death, which really lan't Newman in 1956.
This sympathic mangant in the fantastic film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar at the best movie in 1973.
Amazing and winner player in the great film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which worth him in 1987 his only Oscar between nine nominations.
This guy who changes the years was he.
He still.
The times change during their career.
Young people know him especially thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a hokey team on a little orthodox ice.
His fans saw you again in 1994 in the Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers of Coen.
With a latest role of the Irish mafia's father in the Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was rised.
In contrast to several film legends who left the career quite soon, Newman remained much in the world of the cine, accusing Hollywood, his ears, his sticks and his concessions.
The French cinemaist Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he often interpreted the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholic, cabrons or desperates, whose races reflected the rebelliousness.
As a performer, Newman revealed its real pudic sensitivity very unknown.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (see the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female melancholy portrait.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, power and triumph.
"After the numerous homenages that were deceived yesterday for Newman, his big friend and old partner of weapons Robert Redford (you had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) he was very sad: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important races of the dead actor.
On the other hand, its legendary career is also hidden a great military for civil rights, technology, independent cinema, a questionnaire against Hollywood's people.
We have seen a lot of his face rule over the vinagret salsa boats, salts, galletes and other foods, judgeing this method as a bad pleasure method, though empe > as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Fund for infant in difficulty.
Newman, rather than satisfying his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and until the end, your father was incrediblely grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In the summary of a model citizen.
What were they produced in the Zuschlag & amp; Co. factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal process will be initiated against Janos Zuschlag and its complices.
The political and its complainants are accused of committing significant damage frauds, in the way of business, continuously and in the form of other crimes, including documentation.
The Research was used for the purposes of the funds obtained in the public concurrences in many times justifiing the fulfillment of tasks with factures.
The public funds and the assemblies - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasure of the Balold Fiatal Organization and in part in the box of individuals.
The method, which was also known by researchers, was to justifie the covering of the funds obtained in public concurrences with factures behind which there was no real implementation, the different associations never fulfilled their commitments.
The accusation is held, most of the factures were fair.
To this end, the taxiers received the market in the Jossefváros district and the seals were made in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that, in the name of which company, the facture should be carried out was decided among others at that tour by the Superior Region of Balaton where Janos Zuschlag sent to István Sidos.
This last admitted that for this purpose, he should choose hosts and restaurants.
He requested a fax for its consumption, and these served as a model to construct the factures which were presented among them in the concurrence of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the Capital Assembly.
These factures were signed in their majority by István Sidos and its complice Andrà ōri, who our information was better written the reports necessary to obtain public subventions.
One of his "Studian travels" sides chose a beer.
Two factors issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its complices, this gastronomical centre provided food for a group of ninety people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, the center manager is - so many people are not at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the facture issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
After one host of the locality of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people couldn't join themselves on one night, but in the fax, there were hundred and thirty people.
But the large inspicual factor manufacturers also exhausted when they signed the Gastronomic Centre Pigal Kft. Because in the tendery of books itself - the information given to the Fiscalia - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövért and Hoppá.
Gy\ź Farkas, manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by fiscality and showed the factures, he knew that it was documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He aggregated: Besides the formal problems, he did not agree that the facture was set up 100 people, because there are only 11 rooms in which there are not so many people.
Furthermore, food was also included in the fax, while the restaurant was not working a long time ago.
The enthusiastic factory manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organized travelling outside, so that in the payment fabric they showed stupidly a travel service within Hungary, which was also not coincid with the practice of the Agency's expedition of factures.
Moreover, as it was assumed during the investigation, IVA also included in the document, although travels outside the European Union were excluded from taxes.
Among other things, the IVA measured was also wrong in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövért Foundation, since the services of that company were not charged with a 25 but only with 15% of the IVA, and the employees of the hotel were only extended to machines, however, the facture was manual.
Furthermore, the "expeditors" also made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they placed in the fax as a activities carried out on road transport - it was assumed during fiscal investigations - does not perform the company based as investment adviser.
Similarly, by formal differences - inadequate format of the facture, I assume that the factures issued for Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, for XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
Like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfeherto Sport Camp, whose representatives refused to have sent those factures.
Implementers also noticed that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was coming (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyríregyháza was in liquidation process, so the liquidation process responsibility - is our information - refused to have sent that document.
The factures expired consciously
Another group of factory manufacturers is constituted by those who were aware that they should send ficticial factures.
The Esély Budapestert Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of the Baloldal Fiatal -ifjú Szocialisták, issued a facture for about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredert.
The Manager of Collab Kft. - The accusation - one of the accused ones, Ludovic Gjorfi, convinced him to send ficticial factures.
The Biogate Kft, currently under liquidation process, also cooperated with Zuschlag and its complices, which in 2003 provided factures for an approximately five million HUF value to the foundation Jobb Jövért Alapitvány , the Atlas Egyesület and the Forösfeny-Egyesület association , without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital also, since then the prepared factures were cancelled but they had an invitation to report in their documents to this.
The following group of factory manufacturers includes those who have some link to the accused.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the complainant of the Ucrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with ficticity seat in Budapest, which was occupied with the trade of fuel and vehicles.
This company expired numerous factures for an approximate value of 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of information media.
The data of the investigation were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should also have split the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that has expired on behalf of the Atlasz Facture Company, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány by covering the amount itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by brothers' albanese at the request of Iván Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - the accused - that they did not receive work.
But it benefited from these companies, since, on request of its compliance, lawyer Zsolt Sente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent factures on behalf of companies for Zöschlag associated organizations: for Atlasz and Y-generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave 15 different factors for a value of 14,2 million HUF.
The Fisheries considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the amount of the factures.
That man even used the Szi-Beri command company to send ficticial factures used in the Biztos Pont concurrence.
The Y-generation and Šövetség in Modern Magyaroršágért presented a concurrence in January 2006 to Ta ́sics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), of public use of the Socialist Party.
The concurrence received 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use money for the purposes of the concurrence.
To avoid discovering this, five ficticial factors received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the faxs of the record of the departure that Ard Kemecsei had at the chair of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused ones will probably report in the judgment - as they did in the Fisheries - the course of facturation.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the own main accused Janos Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
After its confessions have not been very detailed until now, and even though he repeatedly promised to speak about everything, this has not done until now.
The question is: What is it interested in doing so? For perhaps in turn to the revolution of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists have reached a agreement with him so that Zusi may take all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, could even be offended for these days, because to deal with his prison conditions, he requested a home arrest, but he was rejected.
While many authors of very higher economic crimes, who have never returned the money, are free or at least able to wait in their own home, he has no chance for it.
Psychology of surprises: Why are we spent more money?
Participants of the substances are intended to expenditure more money and overvalue the product.
Neurological and economicists at the University of New York discovered the economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
The study appeared in the Science magazine, people don't want it in competences such as eBay substances, so they prefer even paying a price.
The scientists have set the neurological scheme of this "play" through experimental substances.
One of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in a substance, and as long as it was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the subpots, where it is a fundamental element to place more than the other, the game intensified the function of the complex called strategy located under the brain cortez.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
In this way, scientists are explained, the increase in stages is explained as a prevention to not provoke an intense reaction to the strategy.
In order to base their theory, the economists of the Scientific Group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment, three groups rebelled against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply communicated with the real value of the product concerned, and its integrants were apostated.
In addition, another group was promised that if they win, they would receive more $15.
Instead, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the submarine, but in the case of the submarine, the integrants of the group had even lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing " against the failure" were willing to apostate even more than the members of the control group and the "ganator" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory previously.
After that, the phenomenon of the subastas was explained only with the joy of winning and risk prevention.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we are now reaching a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of Economy in New York.
Hepatitis: What should you go to the doctor?
In the world, some fifty million people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary the chronic heat disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of contagious in this country is calculated in hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the people do not know that they are contaminated.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different hygiene diseases caused by virus.
The symptoms seem to be very much; the heavy infection and igtericity are characteristics, but their patogenic agents and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogeneous agent are propagated in two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or congestioned food), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with blood and body humor (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consumption of infected food is shown by a bad general state, deficiency, abdominal pain and disappointment.
After that they appear in the skin and in the white eye the ictericia, the excrement becomes clear, dark color orin and healing can last even two-three weeks.
Annually a million people die in the world in cancer and hepatic cirrosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that the estimates are held, only one of each ten contagious receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: without treatment can produce hepatic and even cancer.
Most of the contagious don't know that it's fair because this patological agent ruins in paulatin form the heavy cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
It is therefore very important that premature recognition, systematic medical control.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
There are now about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be discovered with a routine control, it deserves the penalty to consult the family doctor when experimenting some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered at time, it is possible to eliminate the body’s virus, so the contagio can be removed and prevented cancer.
On 30 September, the World Hepatitis Day was organized for the first time in 2004 by representative organizations of the Hepatitis.
It is aimed at calling attention to the causes of chronic hygiene infections caused by viruses and the importance of their pre-acknowledging.
Does it pain at least to whom you believe in God?
The result of a recent research, religious faith has a calm effect that also delighted the death of Catholicism martyrs.
The scientists of the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experience: analysed that religious faith in how it affects human pain - reported the British Journal Telegraph.
In the context of this unique experiment, the shock was applied to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheis, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
There are results, Catholic believers have been able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the research series in which the academics also participate in scientists, philosophers and theologists of the various departments of the University.
The analysis occurred in the following way; they set a scrutinous instrument on the left hand of the patient, which applied the chock of the trailer.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their look at two paintings; the Virgin Maria, the work of Sassoferrat of the 17th century and the Lady of the Army of Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious encouragement among the faithful, while they chose the oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a peaceful effect.
Patients spent a half hour in a MRI scanner, receiving 20 shocks of tricks in four follow-up parts while watching the religious or other topic painting.
The Catholics said that when looking at the Virgin Mary, they felt in "security" as people "protected", "sustained and in her heart ruled peace."
When they observed the religious theme table, they felt a 12 percent less pain than when they looked at the work of the work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impacting image, a similar effect can be achieved with the atei also, just needs to find the appropriate image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality," Wright advised.
After these amazing results, one questioner remains: what would have effect on the regulation of the pain if the faithful were shown by the Madonna of Property or other pintor of its wave?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary drag even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
In his tenth birthday, Google can seem to be found both in the people's bottle and in the sky above his head; you know where their vacations passed, what doctors are visiting and what's interested in them.
But it's Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a paralel with orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times magazine that the main goal of Google is to gather as much personal data on your users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of the founders of Google: "We meet all the information of the world in a system!".
The leader of Google is still at the beginning phase of the efforts to handle all information.
At the question what will happen within five years, Schmidt answered this way: I would like Google to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the work that would be better to me?" - but the software will not be able to answer as simple as the users do not have enough information.
Not all internautes are conscious that during their network navigation, the keywords, IP addresses and pages have been stored exactly at the end of the search.
For example, personalized Search that has debuted two years ago, users can store their own navigation history, can again consult what they were looking for, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more customised searches - in this same logic, the Recommendations will be based on which the system will provide us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopolie.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is more fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, anxiety for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they are not only preserving, but in justifiable cases, there are also third parties with all the expressions seeked, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the internal parties.
The most debated example of the recent times may have been the coordinated action against Brazil pedophiles, when Google delivered the Brazilian government information on its website, Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the contrary, the internautes concerned about the rights of the people, in May, when the company with the EFF, an organization for the Defence of Electronic Rights, had successfully shown before the court that had a right in their dispute with the FBI: if the sentence, it could not be obliged to Google through any of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(The Federal Government has at the same time achieved the pretext of strengthening the law on the protection of the approved infant years ago, approximately fifty thousand web addresses and some thousand phrases seeked, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, neither the full lists of web pages and key words in the last two months.)
This is a pretty contradiction with the view of Google: those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their intimity, their private life starts using Google services, and they are rebellious against it as against multinational image companies.
Meanwhile, the northern American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internautes and users of other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguardian corporation", not so to their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by Windows as conqueror of the world, for both fighting for the same purpose.
This can happen because Google does not ask users any identification code or money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems younger, more co-operator than the official gigant practice of software.
But it may also be because the geeks see exactly the very difficult relationship between people's rights and the Internet that was actually produced by one of the key words mentioned in the last years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about cooperation, leave planned springs behind us and use the available communication channels, and while these measures are different individually, the essence is still the same: showing us ourselves.
A young man can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and even can join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which provides a list of their music habits, then they can include them in a monitoring system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo gallerys are automatically shown in the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of which the girl, for example, seeing the flow of graphs of the morning after the common friends, knows with whom the first night passed her fraudulent boyfriend or can dismiss the employer of a company because this writes his sincere opinion in his blog on the direction of the company: one thing is safe, the definition of the private life is completely revalued.
The life on line of a person is what she shows from herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of our day's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least intends to squire the Google monopolie, can do it (e.g. starting with the Scroogle that uses the Google search system, but does not leave runs).
There are many people who do not want to be registered in the collective pages to avoid finding them, but they can replace Google's "online" applications from the text editing software to the image and reading news applications with alternative versions that do not connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion expects almost to openly the day when Google shows his true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars values more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the publicity agencies, so that services which are introduced more rapidly cause serious head pains not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the higher direction ↓ strictly the protest of the employees after duplicating the price of the infant guardian of the company, considering the unlimited number of employees, but this is nothing compared with the fact that in 2006, Google had ceased before the pressure of the Chinese government and the company was filtered all information that violated the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service with antelation, but only when it was ready to work, that if it is sure that the problems of the next months and years will be able to renew the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and archive of books and magazines of Google will win the dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own whole health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google will create a genetic database, it can provide a good primary material for science works writers, the Scroogled, the popular news of Cory Doctorow, describes the future in orwelia, in which only a man of Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two young men of age helped to delete the shoes to the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police asked two young men of age about the double murder of Ozd who, as suspected, helped to delete the crime's runs - said Tuesday, the carrier of the General Public Order Commissioner of the province of Borsod.
Youths recognized the crime that was imposed on them, and they are currently accused of crime faults.
The two minors - if it is, the information of the Hungarian News Agency is about two girls - they can be defensed freely.
For complication, you can receive up to five years of prison.
The accusation of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - is in prevention arrest since Sunday .
The crime is accused of murdering several people with premeditatation and codecy.
Research has been shown that 23-year-old young man had a large amount to a 53-year-old man.
The accused didn't want to pay his debt, so the midnight of the last week cited his creditor at the office of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year daughter of the victim.
The MTI information is given, the young man was prepared much before to commit crime, because he committed the murder with a hidden weapon before in the crime place.
The police analyzes with an expert to the weapons and the circumstances of its use.
The Borsa de Varsovia presented a offer for purchasing the Board of Prague
The Varsovia Values Board offered two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - for a hundred percent of the actions of the Prague Values Board.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Values Board of Varsovia, confirmed the offer made by the Polandians, although the Czechs previously excluded the Varsovia Board of the potential new owners of the Prague Board.
The reason is that the Varsovia Bolsa is in the hands of the state.
The 99 percent of the actions are in the hands of the Poland State that wants to sell 60 per cent of them within a few months.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the Polish offer was the highest of those who were offered by the Prague Board.
The Czech press is offered, until now they offered the Vienna Bolsa, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Bolsa, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Board and the Deutsche Börse.
Peter Koblic, the leader of the Prague Values Board, declared last week that among the interested people the worst owner would be the Varsovia Values Board and did not dismiss the possibility that in a future the Prague Values Board would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Bolsa in approximately 5 to 10 billion crowns.
The agreement of the EEC could be sold about 90 per cent of the actions.
The largest owner of the Prague Values Board is the investment of Patria Finance with a participation of 25 per cent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent.
Financial crisis from the view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the more deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the North American President - views the Republic of Rome - the President has not been able or has been able to achieve its own party's support for the draft law quickly made, which is the goal to solve this unexpected situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of which the multimillionary investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is better to talk about a "second 11 September".
It is a part of the madrileen press, Washington is the exhibition chivo.
In the view of the World, the error of the United States' political direction was that led to the world economy to the border of the abism.
Increasing the risk of distortion of the Northern American monetary system, and this will then affect the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the vote of the Congress, the risk that Washington does not provide a political instrument to treat the crisis is the danger.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the largest transformations of capitalism history is carried out.
You can't make this threat unnecessary - indicate Ginebra's Days-Indegger.
Some states still today can bring a safe-life circle to the tambalant financial institutions, so that they can save them from the cheap with the money of contributors.
But if the dominion is still more deviated, then the new funds will be no longer enough, nor the new improvizations.
The European Union Member States need to leave their nationalist egoism on one side and centralize control over fragmentated financial markets.
The crisis financial institutions only received more than 100 billion euros on Monday - reports Der Standard Venus, adding that the concerns that, as did the North Americans, also European contributors have to pay much money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not yet severely been occupied with the crisis that occurs as a conname for the Continent Year .
"Salvators" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they definite: in what cases is it justified to use contributors' funds to avoid a greater wrong?
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the beer
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions, unless the imitation of existing obstacles in nature?
For example, one of the abeyors.
In an amazing project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the bullets gave the point of department for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the collection prevention systems.
Nissan, in collaboration with the University of Tokio, designed the robotic engine management system of type BR23C imitator of nature, which gave her the characteristics of the abortions, with the final objective of creating a system that can extinguish all collections.
Each airplane creates its own special oval space that actually seems too much to our security protection capsule - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exposure, RP and development and research technology director.
They play an important role in the eye composed of the abortions that are viewed in all directions in an angle above 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composed eyes, the engineers used the me system of length by laser rays.
This identifies the obstacles before the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculating its distance and sending a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle immediately transformed into a handicap to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot by imitating the movements of the abeyers, changing the direction by rotating the wheels as necessary.
In contrast to any existing system currently, this manual is completely instinct.
"If it wasn't so, the vehicle's robot couldn't repeat with enough speed as to swim the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratorium and the project of vehicle robots.
Reverse immediately and instinctly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable internal layer of the security capsule, in a layer in which currently all types of collisions are considered inevitable.
All the process must reflect what one is doing to squire others.
This process must be performed in an open and close the eyes.
However, in the contrast to the beverages, the movement cannot be moved up, down or diagonal, but it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of roads
Instead of the infinite possibilities for the beverages to swim others, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car to rotation movement and acceleration, as well as frenage.
The BR23C uses litio-polymetro batteries that are lighter and is greater than its energy density, which means they have a longer life duration than the litio-ion.
See Andoh, the important is the instinct and intellectual reaction and not the data processing capacity, not much less than the storage.
This device in each second only must process some input signals and repeat if it is.
This data is not needed to be stored or repeated with an instinct logic based on the data of the previous manuals, so it uses only a few decades of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes memories are required.
This is the first step to develop the technology to straighten the obstacles immediately, which is calculated by Nissan, can be incorporated into the models made in series within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit in the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to its destination, scapping the existing obstacles on its road.
You already have the name of this dear kid.
The written version of the Financial Reserve Package Act of 700 billion dollars has been prepared, which will be applied in several stages with a view to purchasing the bad loans of the debtors.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
It was timely from the East Coast during the new consultations that took up until midnight of the Sabbath, the leaders of the Congress reached a agreement in turn to the 700 billion dollars financial redemption package in total, after several days of discussion - informed the King.
We have achieved an important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the Northern American Congress, and that there is only no formalisation of the agreement in a document.
The commitment taken on the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, talking about the result of the commitment, said: This programme will work and will be yours, but other measures are needed. If Pelosi, it is not to save Wall Street, but to return to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, namely Sunday before the 8th night, is Washington's hour (or before the two moon morning, it is time of Central Europe), without providing a spectacular spring in the balls.
On the draft law called for emergency law for the economic stability of 2008, the first Monday will vote on the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the evening, and we are highly encouraging both parties' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - stated Tony Fratto, the portfolio of the White House.
The programme is different from the original proposal of Bush's administration to expenditure every 700 billion dollars to buy tickets of bad-quality credit credit values.
Now only half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress will probably vote on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will buy titels of credit funds, bad rates and the destination of another 100 billion dollars depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent after a new decision of the Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: it can be purchased at the same time by bad, hypothical and credit values, including other type "venture" credits.
The purchase can be made in substances or in direct form - informed the competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the concerning elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to pre-dama.
Henry Paulson said: The law assures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to satisfy the urgent needs of the North American financial system, it is the purchase of bad financial means, its assurance or the prevention of risks that could cause demoronisation of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as they sign it - he agreed.
Instead, the heads of those who are in charge and wait for State aid can compute with the official limitation of their compensations, which the North American argot calls just gold paracaids.
Only in certain cases, payments will be limited, in addition to limitations of the form of aid of the Ministry of Finance.
Limitation means that if the ministry purchases in the framework of a substance, an additional tax shall be imposed for the gold paracaids unless the malfunctioned boss is jubilated.
By purchasing exactly bad credits, the Government will intervene aggressively to ensure that boss' compensations are not exhausted.
Furthermore, existing gold paracaid contracts will not be changed, limitations are only referring to new contracts to stimulate the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the Northern American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the revenue of the general directors - the Democrate Barney Frank, president of the Congress committee, has commented on that measure.
In addition, the State will have the right to purchase actions of participants in the programme, so the risk of contributors will be reduced, since they will finally even be able to gain profits with the transaction when the economy is recovered and with it.
The draft legislation in the next five years shall be submitted by the President to the Conference a proposal on how to make contributors losses of the financial sector.
Of course, at both sides there were those who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the North American citizens commanded us, namely don't protect the dollars of the contributors - said the Republican Congressist of California, Darrell Issa.
His democracy colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, appealed: the measures insisted on the same as they are responsible for the Wall Street democracy.
Industrial prices continue to be increased
In August 2008, the national industrial sales prices increased with a 0.1 per cent compared to the prices last month and with 12.9 per cent compared to the prices of August 2007 - reported the Central Statistics Office (KSH).
Industrial export prices ascended with 1.1 per cent in relation to July 2008 and decreased 3.9 per cent in respect of the previous year.
As a result of the changes in internal and export prices, the industrial production prices increased with 0.7 per cent in respect of the previous month and with 3.2 per cent in respect of the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only in a minimum measure, with 0.1 per cent.
Internal sales prices in processing sectors increased at least, with 0.1 per cent for July.
The increase in prices was in August 2008 in the skin and calcium production sector (2.8 per cent) due to the increase of 4.6 per cent of the bottles and circles and the increase of 2.5 per cent of the calcium.
The highest price level of plastic and chemical basic materials resulted in significant increase in the chemical branch prices (1.6 percent).
Price decreased in the petrochemic sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper manufacturing, editorial and printing.
In the rest of the processing industry sectors, price increases between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent were recorded.
In the supply of energy, gas, heat and water representing a significant weight within the internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was registered in August, firstly due to the effect of the increasing of the official prices from the first July.
In a comparison of a period of twelve months - in the national sales of processing sectors - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemic sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metabolism sector, a increase of 13,2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drinks and tobacco industry, a determining weight, was increased by 11 percent.
Price decreases were recorded in the textile industry (2.5 percent) as well as in the manufacture of machinery and instruments (0.3 percent).

The next year will no longer be needed to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many opportunities to enter into force approximately 12 January the North American-Hungary agreement on the exoneration of visa - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents.
In its opinion, "practically everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the income premium will disappear, but tourists must be registered before their outcome from the country of origin.
Since today, the leader of Hungarian diplomacy holds conversations in Washington.
It will be interviewed with the State Secretariat of Condoleidad Rice with the Median Star of the Merit Order of the Hungarian Republic and will support negotiations with the international policy advisers of candidates to the presidency, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
So Barack Obama, as well as McCain are for the financial redemption package of the people.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates to the presidency of the two large North American parties, assured their support to the 700 million dollars aid programme on Sunday, but there are politicians that require the Deputy Minister for Finance.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration, after several days of marathon, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreed on the financial redemption package of the people.
The financial package intended to solve Wall Street's crisis and freeze the congeled credit market, became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more than their rival to remove the country from the economic crisis.
The most recent investigations, when the economic issues were placed in the first place, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared from McCain's advantage that had been obtained after the Convention of the Republicans with Sarah Palin's candidature to the presidency.
In a campaign of Detroit, celebrated on Sunday last, Obama expressed its hope that the Congress will quickly adopt the 700 billion dollar package law.
He emphasized that the proposal includes those patterns of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We must act now and with responsibility... is in danger of employment, relief of you, as well as whole industry and stability of the whole economy," he said before a majority of 35,000 people.
He did not benefit from the opportunity to qualify obsolete McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview granted to the ABC McCain, he explained that "we'll all bring this to hard penalties... but he doesn't do anything simply is not a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control committee to the Ministry of Finances and the limitation of the compensations of the executives, which insisted on it.
Obama stated to the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted the Minister daily.
The Chairman of the Congress of Nancy Pelosi appealed on Sunday that the Congressists will probably vote on the draft law already on Monday.
German speaking area print review
The group of de is intact, only within the own group, the most conscious electors have become -• Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Baviera.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent red coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the e-electronic German magazine Franz Walter, in its article titled "The Baviera Revolution consumes her parents" analyzes the reasons for the CSU's wounded dramatics.
It is known to the polytologic, the erosion of the CSU has been started much before the triste Beckstein-Huber had assumed its charge.
Social Christians for several decades were developing in Baviera - and right now these modern citizens are those who give their backs.
The change of a era is at the same time a problem of all the Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not absolutely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed for almost ten years ago: the inadmissible hegemonia of a state party was disappeared.
Ten years ago, the CSU received 47.7 per cent in 1998, for the first time under 50 per cent since the fifty years.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, which is still during the so mentioned period of Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the consuming provincie of its progenitors .
Sociologists have been pronounced this 40 years ago, but in the time, they have been very wrong, but secularizing, the results of the education and seating of the North Germans in the developed regions of Baviera have had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU electors.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities, and it also has political consequences.
The group of de is intake, only within the own group the most conscious, critical and more testarid electors have become.
It is amazing that in the last weeks, the conventional groups of citizens were those who have been removing more from the CSU; the autonomes, the small industrialists, those who have bachillerate and diplomates.
The support to the CSU was thus reduced by less than 40 per cent.
The press (depresse.com)
The Conservative Journal of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article "The Presidents of the Parties are very reserved in coalition issues" - it is concerned about the confused situation of the internal policy after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to be mixed in its internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, but the green in exchange do not want to make consultations on coalition yet.
The elections have already been held, now everything turns back to coalition; in the debate held at the public television, the leaders of the party just left a few of their bars.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman asked the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, at the position of canciller.
He suggested that they disapproved Schüssel-Molter's era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Multiter re-eyearly for the red offers.
He said that the cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann’s introduction into the internal issues of the OECD.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter into the coalition, these issues must be discussed without doubt within the own OECD.
The President of BZÖ, Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government" said Haider.
Jaróka: It must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Assembly for the Equality of opportunities has been started in Paris, and its employee is France that this year is also a representative of the European Union's turnover.
Livia Jaróka, member of the European People's Party by Fidesz, in its message addressed to the full, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most severe violations of gitan children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was incurred - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social matters and equal opportunities.
They assisted the representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations.
Jaróka - the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, gitans remain out of the work market first for their lower school level.
"The majority of gitan young people have not finished the average education and because of the bad quality of the basic education, only one insignificant part can obtain university diploma."
Jaróka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights.
Investment in the education of Gitan children at age may strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
The European Parliament is concerned that these issues should be largely conscious of both gitan and non-Gitan.
As soon as the school begins a gitan student, more opportunities will be to become a active member of the work market; to the rent and consumption tax they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The Gitanians, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure the right to quality education and to ensure the abbolition of segregated and low-level education," said Livia Yaróka.
Euro-deputy, the European Union's objective and active unit is needed to accelerate the school disgregation processes immediately, so it is essential that the proper implementation of existing and scheduled antidiscrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Gitan children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Jaróka said.
The objective of the European Summary for Equality of opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting of the last year held in the sign of the "European Year of Equality of opportunities" is to ensure a single forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equality of opportunities at European level and at national level of Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision on the happiness of Huber-Beckstein failure will be taken
Despite the severe electoral damage, no heads have yet been cut in the walls of the bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has currently been post-term.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, Prime Minister of the Province, still remains in their posts, but it is not known until it will durate grace.
The lucky of the party, who has suffered a 17 percent electoral damage, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The integrants of such a criticised person left to interview: they do not have so much interest in their positions.
Thus, they intended to calm the furious members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who on one day after the "sunami bavaro" had personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was on the top of his career - the social union reaches a 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the struggle confirmed against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent were obtained.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopolio" in Baviera, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the South Province, of key importance for Hungarian economy, conservators continue to predominate, in the future they must without doubt make coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the renewal of the party, President Horst Seehofer, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the reduced intellectual group starting negotiations with the Liberal FDP and with Free Electors on a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
The strange destination is that in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the hit of Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly removed from the scenario to the ambitional local policy.
The maximum leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, it will also receive an active role of Stoiber that has still been moving the arrows in the bottom, the former leader of the Province and former President of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the worst day of its political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical observations to the CDU, in their opinion they would have deserved much more support for the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the damage as a warning for the CDU and for its own Angela Merkel.
After the elections of September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel may not be cancer if they are not able to highlight the CSU together that played a crucial role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
It is Merkel that hard penalties could hide their deceit for the failure, the losses of the CSU will not affect negatively the big Berlin coalition.
What is naturally related: it will not be easier to treat the vulnerable CSU and the crisis of the continued social democrats.
The SPD with its 18,6 percent reaches its worst result since 1946 in Baviera.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections of Sunday, there will be no member or member in the Belarus Parliament.
The Russian observators, this is explained with the welfare and stability guaranteed in the country of Alexandr Lukashenko, in turn by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is better explained with violations of the law committed during the votes.
The OSCE who sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognize the electoral result.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated by a hundred and ten Members, has no opposition for more than one decade before the elections of yesterday the unified opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who, for the fourth time, renewed its mandate after the elections of 2006, would be "permitted" by the amendment of the Constitution this time to the introduction of some members of the opposition to the parliament.
So ODSZ removed the boicot that originally wanted to do.
On the basis of the expectations of opposition it was that Belarus, which is more economically dependent on Russia - which has taken a loan to modify the import of natural gas in a far more face of Russia and who has contributed to the sale to Beltransgaz, the owner of gas from the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow the income to Luxembourghenko and other high-level politicians for having an antidemocracy political regime.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, by evaluating the electoral campaign, focused more on positive phenomenon and not on errors - such as the participation of taxation to a third of the candidates of opposition.
However, the primary report of the OSCE on Monday criticized even the campaign - in which the candidates of opposition could not appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the context of votes.
Without all this, in view of the opposition, there is a improvement in the political climate: political prisoners remained free and Minsk is available to a small confrontation with Moscow, refusing the recognition of the Separation of South Osetia and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - a month ago considered the two regions independent.
- We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been started - stated to our magazine Alexander Milinkevich.
The candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006 is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow the entry into that Parliament to be a person or a member."
The opposition is not planning to organize protest manifestations by seeing the results, but rather to make electors their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the press of opposition in Russia, local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that they are still more supporting the change between the elderly also - said Milinkevich, saying that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate or if the convictions are officially the most subvented by the regime.
As a result of the demand of the country and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that the decomposition of social security is "like the silence of the cementaries"," Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, contrary to the opposition policy, qualified democracy to elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe not in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is not something else than the witness of the matureness of the Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "From now and again, it's a break before it begins to work"
It has never happened in the Chigi Palace History that would put auto-ports to control the input and output of the staff.
but since today he starts with this measure against who's sticking and then goes to the bar to take a coffee at worktime.
This newness has been presented today by the Minister for Public Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Automatical doors," says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" needs the minister.
"The new seasons of responsibility and transparency are now opened.
This is Reformism," it re-describes Brunetta.
With the Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council's Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of auto-ports is also important from the yes point of view".
No resistance has been found by the employees, assured by the Secretary-General: "a change has been made by the workers and the cooperation has been made by them."
Finally, no longer breakfast at worktime; no more coffee and middle months.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, laughing, "a good capuchin at the 7th morning is a holy hand."
A convention at the Superior School of the Public
of Rome, the Minister states that "in three months the absence of diseases of public employees has been reduced by 50%, meaning more than 60,000 people at work in a year".
And adds that it is necessary to make the public more effective
Italian, "which salarial dynamics," explains the Minister, have been doubled in the last 8-10 years with regard to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For now, millions of public employees have been united to oppose the rules of Brunetta decree with the supported request by the Codacons.
"When the Ministry of the Public Function shows the numbers, the smaller labour absentism for diseases – writes the consumer association – the people of the 'busy workers' are continuing to increase .
The workers of the right and productive public administration are actually millions in Italy who have joined wars to the illegal standards of the decree."
In particular, the Tar is responsible for the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by disease due to service; the timelines in which medical control visits are carried out and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
A jobs, Napolitan: "Crecial Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents have been observed, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths have been approximately ↓00.
Numbers that testify the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost a double death in the case of murderers.
To call on the attention of institutions, social forces and media of information on this dramatic issue, Anmil today celebrates the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy by the victims of work accidents, instituted on second Sunday of October.
"The concernful data distributed by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirms how important the question of prevention in the work is," in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association Mutilated and invalid by the work, Peter Mercanda.
The head of the State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant associative efforts for the prevention in the workplace, the protection of lost workers, the assistance to victims' families and the public opinion".
"A "basta" has been manifested, sincerely, to tragedies that, by their dimensions, lead to the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead of the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamic."
Napolitan does not hide that " there is no doubt a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particularly, many promoted initiatives in the field of school for a more direct conscience takes part of young people who enter in the world of work.
It is a debt to maintain vital attention to the phenomenon, not to breathe the alarm on social severity, to implement and to improve legislation rules.
By its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber underlined "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which distorts the conscience of each of us and makes all institutions a decided efforts to put urgently end."
"Data on accidents in the work seems to indicate a light positive walk, but this does not remove the number of white deaths too impressive," commented the President of Anmil Pietro Mercande.
"We don't really want this "decreasingness" to be translated into less attention, because it's just when the attention reduces the explosion of tragedy.
"We believe that at general level it is still too little to contrary the phenomenon of accidents and the medicine can be exercised to multiple actions.
They are needed, to our criteria - has highlighted Mercande – greater controls and inspections, but also stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world. "
"There is a further effort - he has added - why it is aware of the communication and the employment of the public opinion.
But, especially, it is a greater sense of responsibility of employees in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercanda has declared "the deteriorated progressive level of subsidiary protection for the victims of the work" and "the assistance derivation to which the system is being addressed in the past years".
"The goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the employer - he has added - because the lucky one who is accidentally not needs to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under accusation, risk audience
Hearing music at high volume for a long time using computer music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent lesions to hear.
The European Commission refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the emergency and recently identified health risk (Cssseri) of the Ue, published today in a broadcast communication in Brussels.
"From this scientific opinion – read in the note – is that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with laptop devices weekly for more than one hour a day with the high volume device risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity."
"I worry about the fact that such a high number of youths that often use phone music and mobile phones at high axis level can unconsciously destroy their ears in irremediable manner," -- Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific tests - follows the responsibility of Ue - there is a clear risk, and we must repeat quickly.
What it tells is to make consumers and provide this public domain information.
We re-examin, as well as the existing control systems in light of this scientific opinion, to be extensively effective and to take steps with the new technologies."
Bruxel had requested the Cient Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of laptop musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the sound that originates.
"The scientists - concluded by the Executive Ue - confirms that it is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the interested parties that measures may be taken to better protect children and adolescents from the exhibition to the voice resulting from laptop musical devices and toys."
Currently, there is a European security standard that limits to 100 dB the level of sound of laptop musical devices, but anxiety increases as the auditive damage that can result from an exposure to such sound sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damage by providing solutions such as reduction of levels and exposure time to sound.
According to its opinion, the Committee Cient · Ue notes that the users of computer musical devices are listening to a high volume (meer than 89 decibels)music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for the maximum volume in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for more longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that 5-10% of the users of such equipment and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, German gives the Commission the way for the future of capital
Today, in March it is closed, the accounts will be made in June.
This is the calendar set by the municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new seat behind the Termes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will deal with the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the assembly and the communal advice will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official ball" of the municipality and its inevitable Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it intends to subscribe German – will provide proposals for Rome's development in which those who decide politically, the assembly and the municipal advice will be able to follow.
There is no more role position, but only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, works will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announce the inevitable – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome."
The Commission's accusation of inutile, since its opinions are not binding, the German answers: "All depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am safe in Rome, it will be essential.
Policy is almost always involved in the management and in returning events.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and long-term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for Rome's development and its future."
The inhabitant of Rome also intends to note that "this Commission is not an unusual body or a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and it will serve to participate and reason the best minds that the capital expresses."
For Germans, actually, "the needs to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a level-spot, of which we absolutely need, thinking with a single spirit to his future."
A future that, in need of the inevitable in Rome, had not only limited to the current communal borders but would look there, not only in the opticity of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital, but also in view of the role that Rome can and must develop as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a American political note that interests you to pass by independence: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, reduced the US economy and had relations (as he also gives a private citizen today) with the enemy Islam."
Increasing attacks against Obama as close to the date of elections.
a Miami lady wrote on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he thinks he wins the highest charge of the nation who has had two rulers and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and do not answer the question of the electors: Will he be a good president? And they are the sondees; they all say Obama wins and with a good advantage.
In this case there is also one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A journal of the Mississipi, in the entrances of the south of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the cabin to vote, we will well know who will vote by the American patriot.
Get out one side of the mentality and have a ́erta to the last.
"Tell what they want, we'll think where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you come to win Obama, we'll go from America.
Never mentioned before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the weapon wins for democracy is George Bush.
1500 people have requested: What errors have been made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to the back.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost life and the Americans have not been forced to make the valleys.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been the weakest point of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic colapse is also caused to feel for journalists: in the magazine is time of courts. Many people blame the Internet, "assassin" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been interpelled by →W Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
However, today the journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for journalists and journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the courts made in the room where the editors work to perform the magazine are a big problem.
It is a problem that should be solved, the interviewed journalists should be, if they do not want traditional journalism as they understand most of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but completed pessimism predominates today on journalist and.
Six over ten journalists and executives are convinced that the periodism at national level is following a wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printing against emission.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest editorial houses are opened a break on the Internet, for many views such as the "master" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" warned journalists has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are broke technology in the hope "to do something good" for journalism.
The biggest roture today in the American journalism is among who the newspapers are guided – or directors – and journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure that their journalists have the same values, while at local level the percentage is lower to 23%.
For some, this has to be regarded with the "security of work".
The executives who think of the job in 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the periodist staff is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation such as the US, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet employees often offer what they want and become such a question of "taking or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good salaries, while editors can win up to $10,000 per month, but the jubilation and social insurance.
For vacations, reasoning is made complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, by their admission, are "ills" followed during the year.
It's all a climate issue.
UNIPOL: ROMA TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STATE IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to make the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had requested to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in Rome.
Coopola this undertaking in the field of research on the anti-pacte on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arresting process , last week, he has received the homelife, transforms it into mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate carry out the city of the province to a capital room.
This trip (which the pm has voted in contrast) would allow you to influence your society and to test it.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the room of representatives against the 700 million dollars saving plan by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, but interested in punishing Wall Street to save the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday informs us that the current crisis is disarmaing the Republican party, always more divided between its old man of the East Coast, moderated, favorable to the federal institutions and business institutions, and its new soul, instead, conservate, enemies to "they in Washington" and the world of the finance, strong, especially in the states of the Centre and South.
The soul, in fact, has become pre-powerful with the vote of who was speaking at the beginning.
This is just a example of mutations, of large mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the O and not only here.
Whether in the United States as in Europe a long time, the crisis seems to work as a accelerator of incubation phenomenon that with the new climate are solidized and out to light.
The first of these phenomenons is the re-upgrade, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category of state-sovereignty in relation to a type of nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, actually, is a crisis of institutions- funding which had strong financial relations with the outside, but mostly the balances of the families living in one country and in a single state are committed much more.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for who he is governing is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically worldwide, but it is politically and nationally.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or they do not have much to say: the key evidence is the European Union that is always divided between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is the Government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules, and particularly the subvention of funds: since the court is reached, only the state of economic resources and the mass of financial resources to meet things.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two incompatible resources, values in certain circumstances where no market is likely and no organization can never be available in the same measure.
This new emphasis on the state of nationality is in perfect synthony, with the greatest importance when the new development of the economy is intended to assign it to a very linked factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of technology always more sophisticated, of immaterial, while we were convinced that the global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would change the accounts more more with small things such as water, culture and oil.
All things that, you think, can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth but are also united in absolute manner in a circumscripted space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign, has certainly many more letters about who he is not, and to whom he has the unfortunateness of living in a place without cultivation, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second newness, but it's a fraction.
He who says Territorium, State, Government, inevit
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomenon.
On the one hand, the objective conscience of the need of a leadership, the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a discredit wall for existing leaders, of inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together, something deeper and in a certain sense inquireful: a discredit, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of legendship, which aims to involve the whole O'e countries' leader class in a growing number.
It seems to be more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elite until now in growth, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding of the end, have made their own time and to be more stranger to the majority's opinions.
The request for leadership, in few words, provides subterraneously a ramified but powerful movement to delegate the leading classes and traditional policies, which are shown in a "electoral" revolt or in the sudden changes of collective humors of these recent times, from the outcome of conservation in Austria-Baviera to the collapsing of the social-democracy consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congress men against Bush (and also with the victory of the deeper in Italy who has something to see).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would always make more difficult to understand and then represent, which since today is being taken into form are the deep strategy of the west society and that the economic crisis renews, grows and acts potentially in dismemberment.
In front of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion” today is honestly exagered.
But having open eyes certainly isn't.
The super sticking to walk over the walls
Overcome gravity laws thanks to a super pegment and in a future walking on walls like the man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a four-institution team has reached quite closely.
With only 2.5 centimeters squared, the scientists could have picked a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – The American Scientific magazine has published the discoveries of some researchers at the Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing people who use a particular carbon, called carbon nanotubs.
“The principle of the pigment can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaguetis pile” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired to the gates of gecos, microscopic hair reherits that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
The tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflone, and liga paper, have shown that the new adessive is ten times more powerful of the feet of this reptil and at the same time easily removes from the walls” explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
PATH FOR THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as transitional adesivity," adds Liming Dai.
You can walk through the walls exactly like the man arane? Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because the carbon nanotics are warm and running drivers of the electrical device.
Other applications could have regard to space engineering.
For the moment nothing of superheroes.
Other INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, in California, is also dedicated to the search of a new adhesive.
In a article of the magazine American Chemical Society, Californian students have presented an adessive effect of micro fibres as hairs self-sheet during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit jug
Attention to the pomelo jug, the naranja and the bottle.
These drinks, particularly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some medicines, they change their absorption by enhancing or reducing the case, the health results.
To repeat the risk of fruit games, freshly associated with the adoption of some medicines, David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of American Chemical Society currently sends a new alarm to Philadelphia: enough is a pomelio, naranja and manzana juice vessel to reduce the absorption of some medicines, canceling the beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The pomelo jug was already accused because it was maintained responsible for increased at toxic levels of arithmic antibiotics, antibiotics, ansiolytics, antihistamics and neurological medicines.
FARMACEUTICAL A RIESGOS – The same Italian pharmaceutical agency had given the news in two years ago, alarming doctors and patients to not subestimate the risk that resulted from this mixture and taking attention to what it was drinking in the case of a medicine is being taken, such as Diasepam or the Metadone.
NOT SOLO THE POMELO – Experts are also the yoke of naranja and manzana contain substances that inhibit the medicines.
A long list of active principles inhibited by pomelio and other games.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Medical Pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "These discoveries are generally listed to the various international and national medicine agencies, which may result in changing the information notes of it.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the illustrative brochures of medicines that are used and if there is something that is not clear to us, not let us be impressed, asking clearly to the doctor or pharmaceutical”, stressed the expert of the Ansa Agency.
The Economy News to Paul Krugman
The noble economic premium has been assigned to the American Paul Krugman by its studies, trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a chinesian nine who teaches the University of Princeton and is a note editorial of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of Bush administration decisions on economic and external policy.
A few months after the attention of 11 September 2001, in those days, Enron broke you, Krugman had planned in a editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more determining than the first, at the end of the consequence of the United States.
A predict that makes me very polemical and that for several years I was reproached to the economy, but that now has been manifested exactly.
“I am surprised and a little worried about how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom colapse scandal had quickly disappeared from the public’s attention” Krugman had declared at the end of 2002.
See Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Committee, Krugman is a "ground value economy" but also a divulgator with a very aggressive style, particularly critical against the liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, the third and the third package "anti-Microsoft"
It's the day of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity that wants to attract always more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as free alternative to known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost one year of voluntary developers, of whom their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: to the welcoming screen and to the browsing interface less bigger, others are added more consistently, such as the compatibility of the Apple Mac OS X operational system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) ↓, the last ISO standard version.
Attention also made to multi-operation with the Office Suite 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific functions of some modules such as that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphical design module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front can be created "Hybrid PDF" documents which collect the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text designer.
Cooperation is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet can intervene in several users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the text-building, each cooperator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to carry out some of the OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the next weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be held at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English on the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
At request, the home or work installation CD can also be sent.
And if the freedom topic can be a gain for the diffusion in the houses, it is in business area that Open Office is the sequence of testing, the great appointment, which can already account with several projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And they do not miss the facts that offer a service of training, consultation and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business perspectives could be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video write the relevant Word; Calc, is the estimation sheet that substitutes Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eat in the case of known Access is the program that can work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 billion until today, with the outcome of the new version, it is that it is possible to exceed the estimated number.
Kohl also results positive is the fourth case of do.
New positive case in France's tour: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best scaler remorse.
The news is the site of the magazine The Team.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive corridor to the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, they also from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood campaigns comes between those performed in Losanna and Chatenay-Mala's last weeks.
If the tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will be the third place in the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of the positive donation of Kohl to the Epo of third generation is the leader of the French Antido agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year Austrian has been placed in the podium at the backs of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, adjudic is the rear of the best scaler.
INMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES AWAKE, ITALIA IS RACISTA?
Italy of emigrant country has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racistes? This is what New York Times asks in a long article who has dedicated the debate on the racism theme in Italy, departing from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of galletes.
This case shows what New York Times defines the "North Paradoga": Northern regions are at the same time those where "may integration and more work" are recorded but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the North liga.
As confirmed by the growing stress between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times also quoted intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation dear by the Law also appreciates the immigration freneal and facilitates the expulsion of clandestins is quoted as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
It is noted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitan finding Benedetto XVI in the Congress has requested that the State and the Church work together to fight racism."
Students of the dear rental victims, up to 900 euros for a room
The acquisition market for universities does not know the crisis.
The latest survey of Sunia, the inquilina's syndicate, to acquire a single room could cost a student of 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Napoles, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already taken very serious features until the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the high costs that the family should support – explains the responsibility for the Sunian study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong request has completely deformed the market in such a point of designing a generalized increase process to the residents."
Except in most cases, the offers of winners contain a series of violations: free, not registered, without limits of canon, under linked winners.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that prices may be regulated at the revision of tax tax.
Seeing in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, by a bed in Brianza, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from at least 650 (France Bande Zone) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 (in Victoria).
In Florence a average coast bed of 350/400 euros, a room of approximately 700 euros.
In Bolivia, where students focus on the areas near the University, they serve EUR 250/280 for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only smaller values (550 euros for a single room) in areas nearby other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
Economy is made only if periferic area is changed: EUR 300 per bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Napoles for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlines, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari for a bed serves you 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in the youngest cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as in Perugia, where the phenomenon of students and extracommunications is more frequent, further anomalia is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students in respect of the Italians.
Bye to the old movie Paradiso, towns cancel historical rooms
History cinematographic rooms are closed by promoting the Multiplex.
"A city without film rooms in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore is effectively graphing what is happening in the large Italian cities and also in the cities of province.
The Chinese marginalisation process, which, with the birth of big methonics in the area and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indiscutable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory,"and as if a friend died, a known person with whom it was a part of location and so much emotion”, observed the director of the new film Paradiso, the movie that I wined the prime Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, which counted the poesie of a provincial cineroom and nostalgia for the way to live the movie that may be lost forever.
The numbers given by the Anec, the main trade partnership, are clear: In the last five years, 316 traditional cinema have been closed, and to pay most of them are mainly the rooms of the major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bolonia and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most closed regions are the first, Emilia-Romania with 82 less Chinese, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advancement of the multiplex, these three Italian regions who have registered the largest number of new methonic cines: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Toscana as in Emilia-Romania.
“The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally” notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec," it would be useful to build news, but it would be necessary to ensure the residence of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all of its frequencies are ready to transfer to methonics.
Without talking about the lack of funds for the traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would be between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interestingly the case of Bolonia, the first Italian city concerned about the closures, decided to be repaired with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the mono-sala movie is in the history center and in the area.
Among the rules provided, there are media for tax facilitation for public managers and benefits in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the limited traffic area and have special tariffs for stationing.
“This is a initiative I like” notes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bolonia, putting in place other measures.
It is true, in contrast with the extra power of methonics, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more necessary.
The defense of the traditional cine was always important for me: the closure of the Baghheria cine, the place of my infance and adolescence, was the chispa that convinced me to perform the "New Movie Paradise", which I thought for 10 years ago.

The link between political and anranghetta has been arrested by the leader of Gioia Tauro
"The Master of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the municipality for the interested in the piroma cosca."
The accusations that the judges of the Anti-mafia Directory of Calabria give to the inevitable and inevitable Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
It also arrested Gioacchino Piroma, the elder's mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandfather, the boss' uncle, already condemned by mafia criminal association and compensated 10 million euros.
"From any legal and moral standard, and in good manner," the applicants wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to the lawyer Piroma.
"It would have been allowed to the mafiosa family – the judges - to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and management of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that there are " agreements between the organized bad life" in its region: "There are zones where mafia intensity is stronger than in other, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the "Dranghetta, heroes that keep them."
The arrested by this morning are added to those from the past July after the police had announced the court of the Mafiosa Piroma family.
Since the end of April, the municipal advice of Gioia Tauro had been resolved, in 1991 and always by conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been subject to the responsibility of administration of the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, inevitably from Udc at the time of the resolution, after the ballotage to May 2006, was elected as a head of a centre coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the resolution of the municipal advice.
I call for the Minister of Interior that at that time was Marco Min日, appealing him to have organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piroma has even been asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made in Dal Torrione, judges write, "the needs of a businessman, a very close group of the Pimo clan, are being uniformed by the elections of the public administration on the interests of mafios families."
When energy is born from the walls, the big ones go down to the scenario
It is an extermined age that takes over 70% of the planet's surface and are now discovering it, the large global energy companies.
Wools, flowers, marines are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of recovery of energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has been intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of use of marine energy was separated, but now the environmental cases and the new oil increase are impulsed to the sector.
London World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the need for the world’s electricity could be obtained by implants exploding the movement of the sea walls.
This amount would be the double of the currently produced by nuclear centres.
And they would also be the flowers and the sea.
Gigantes to the attack.
The first company to put on marine energy was Enersis, which has signed an agreement in 2005 to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced, there appeared a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance to put on marine energy, they are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron's studying the ocean energy technologies – has declared the portfolio of a company associated with ha has to the cold oil and to the Wall Street Journal economic journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned is on the obtaining of a authorisation of the Commission for Energy and Energy, for the implementation of a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that the US are still extracting oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has activated a plan to perform new perforations.
Furthermore, Chevron is viewing the Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the way of energy coming from the sea, the total invested until now, although they are not detailed indicate an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy does not doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as the Portuguese or the Others are of small dimensions and seem not to create big eco problems.
In order to produce a long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, use a good unit system between them.
The force of the walls, which makes the goods move up and down, becomes awaulic pressure with pistons and cylindres inside them.
Pressure turns a turbine that at the same time feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast to submarine caves.
For now, four are the implants of this type in developing ways, expecting only the federal approval, other than energy, could serve for a military installation.
See > Power, however, produces already energy for a commercial centre and for a station, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The moving of the water when there are marbles, turns the turbine palettes, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
View has said that you have a long list of customers in wait for the authorisations necessary to use energy.
After the walls, the walls.
A particular interest, said in the Institute for Energy Development, deserves currently the potential of marine.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the sea are more preventive than the wind, the sun or the oils, and therefore more reliable as energy source.
It is especially about the energy of the seamarks such as New York, Eagle and Alaska, together with others approaching the coasts, invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and a 35 million investment is expected for 2009.
