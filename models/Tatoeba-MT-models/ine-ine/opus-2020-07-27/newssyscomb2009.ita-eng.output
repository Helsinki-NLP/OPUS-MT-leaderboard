The trionph of the right peoples in Austria: in total they have 29%
The indebolition of both existing parties in the large coalition and this marked strengthening of the peoples of the right party has brought, according to the first prospector results, to the previous parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (ÖVP), within which the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously emptying, has soon lost very strong.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the subprefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the trionphal return in the political policy.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the social-democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, however, in comparison with the last elections of 2006, 5.5%.
It has been worse for ÖVP, which loses 25.6% by nearly 9% of votes.
There are the worst results of these two large parties in the Austrian history of Dopoguerra and, in particular, the literal catastrophic result of the people, which have caused predicted elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a great advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the electors have clearly punished them because they have made the Government deteriorate.
In the first reactions to the result, there have been speculations on the possible releases of the Chairman of the Party, Wilhelm Monter.
The observers believe that they could have occurred on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party's direction.
This evolution may be to facilitate the way to the most likely way of output from the electoral result, which is the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both the peoples of the right and the liberal parties (FPÖ) they have previously gained 18% and the BZÖ 11% of votes - but the sociodemocrats have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the people agreed with the peoples to the collective government, (now the FPÖ was still united, separated from the BZÖ in 2005) that it was even a reason for sanctions from the European Union.
About this evolution, obviously, Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to handle with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in the political policy.
In Parliament it was also possible to enter the Green Party, which, however, was lowly fallen, descending among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% surface and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be refrigerated
If you couldn't repeat the problem with the Czech scientists who have been held in the illegal collection of Scarbai in India, it would be, according to the Ministry of Czech Externals Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refreshment of the Czech-Indian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after the meeting of today with his Indian Omologe Pranab Mukherjee.
"If he doesn't repeat, then it would have a certain refrigeration," he found after the meeting that was held under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after negotiations said that the executive power could hardly enter into the legal facts.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was approved and punished with a torture, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem may be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, for Emil Kuchera sentenced to three years of prison, it would be better to return to a ‘test instance.
Then you can ask for freedom of caution and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during negotiations.
"Recommend the recovery to the Major Court then will be able to obtain grace," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech Party can enter into the case is to provide for the convictions the "comprehensive legal subscription" has been supported by the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such a support is already being provided by the Indian party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been made with India for many years.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said in the CZK, before his partner, he highlighted that the Czech Republic is important to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a deep mistake to the reclusion and accusation of these blind scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if the Indian party has obtained the pro­ject to take care of the matter.
"I got so many promises," she just found.
A Czech Judge in the Marine Funds
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is designed and the sea areas are added.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to the island and with it the marine baseline.
The area is large at the same time as the continent itself, says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who is part of a team of 33 workers of OSN Division for marine issues and maritime rights.
His boss, the Czech Chairman of the Division, Václav Mikulka, follows his exhibition and adds something.
Does the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The marine foundation is still hiding a lowly known world of natural resources.
Oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials can be found, but also unknown live organisms that bring the key to discovering the medicine against cancer.
The largest foundation of the terraferma
The states have started to provide interest in the sub-seater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, the laws on which they have made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is especially the area of the so-called continental platform that often extends to hundreds of kilometers from the coast of the state concerned.
This has, according to the Convention, an exclusive right on all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platforms, the part of marine baseline and its underground is a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic area is often spread outside the territorial sea over 200 miles [200 km]," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country presents before the Committee for the Determination of the Dimensions of the Continent Platform must be accompanied by a very large technical and scientific documentation based on many costuous investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation for many years.
"One of our tasks is to seek the Commission a legal and technical and professional.
The committee has too dealt with five requests of Russia, Brazil, Others, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominated have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The latest success of the marine acquisition that has substantially expanded has registered a global eco.
But also the New Zealand has gained us - the surface of the sea foundation, which has been signed by the Commission last week, of about 1,6 square kilometers, so more or less six times greater than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will produce it in the future from the marine funds, as they are promised, will be inevaluable.
Other States will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do that for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental platform ends starts the area of the ocean fund that the Convention has declared the common inheritance of the 'humanity'."
There's no one who has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this internal institution established by the Convention.
"But the Sea Fund is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their scheme established contractually."
The Czech in the Figure
A part of the marine foundation belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If you disrupt it with other states of the former Soviet block in the scope of the "Interoceanmetal Common Organization".
This bought in 1991 according to the convention, as well as the investors of few other states, the status of such a "pionier investor".
He has the right to extract in the area of the regionClipperton in the ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and less larger than the ex Czechoslovakia.
The fund is broadcast, it is a nearly submarine replica of Tatry.
"It can be stretched on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich age of polymetallic agglomerates containing nigel, ram, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the division of Rober Sandev brings a record with himself to show it.
It seems to be a little patate or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of the Golem's wake up.
German special units were present to the release of obstacles
The Egyptian government had requested to Germany for the release of obstacles – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they were not intervened.
On the circumstances of the liberation of the 11 secure European barriers, we are still more detailed.
On the Saving Operation as referred to by the Defence Minister and the Internal Minister, you have participated in the German special units.
In addition to the experts of the exercise, the GSG9 units were present, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistic experts of the technical institution.
As reported by the portfolio of the ministers Monday evening, the German units have not been intervened because the sequestrators, given the danger of a force intervention, have released the fleeing obstacles.
The Egyptian Government accepted the a offered by the Germans to join themselves as aid directly on the place.
"We haven't arrived for happiness," said a portfolio of the Ministry of Interior.
The attackers took a group of travelers in the south of Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the rape into a desert area in the south of Egypt, the obstacles were deported into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Ciad.
The identity of the retractors until the end remains secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The freedoms at the same time arrived in good conditions in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released obstacles are under the protection of the German ambassador.
You did not explain the details of the release.
There were no information in Berlin for when they would return to Germany.
According to the 5 holidays and special units, they should fly with a military airbus and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
American representative room rejects the salvation package.
The first room of the American Congress has failed the 700 billion dollars saving package for the seas.
Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes towards 227 the American representative house rejected the government's salvation package for the financial seas.
Despite the calls of the American President George W. Bush and the first-planed politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the seas should be argued.
In a dramatic action, the supporters have tried discouragedly to convince the critics from the weighting package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged the members to consensus, even if the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the suffering was being running, Dow Jones was crossed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the concerns of investors was that the state salvation package could fail.
It was repeated before the end of the vote forward, after the failure announcement, to revoke.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences on internal financial seas.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it is necessary to have the benefit of both the members and the Senate's room.
Promotors register numbers increasing reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to a study, the facturation of travel reservations for the next months in comparison to the year has been clearly increased - for winter season even more than 30%.
Despite the weaknesses of congies, the desire of traveling Germans standing at an investigation remains sad.
On the winter season reservations the travel agencies registered a more than 31 % of the facturation compared to the same period of the year , as the German DRV tourism association reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the GfK Market Research Institute, there are increased booking quotas already for the outermost months.
Therefore, the excedence of travel agencies for October, compared to 2007, would be about 11%, reported the DRV.
For these results, GfK's numbers are expected to analyze monthly the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and provide statistical projections for the whole market.
In addition, the travel reservations would be made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak quotation of the dollar, which is required in particular to travel into the United States, the DRV refers.
Here the increase in the reservations would be about one third.
They would also be particularly requested to travel at the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as localities in Germany.
In particular, travels include a high quota, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased energy and food, in this case they would be better calculatable for customers than for individually organized vacation."
The consumers could save money through, among others, out of reservations made with strong anticipation or offers including, Laepple explained.
Moreover, the months of extinction would have registered optimal booking numbers, so as in respect of the year before it would be recorded a excedence of the facturation - even if, according to an additional study, the number of Germans who have traveled, in comparison to the year has fallen.
My first time in Octoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln grips.
A Wesn Debutt
Susanne Kronzucker and I have actually not much common.
You're bionda, moderate television and carry a Dirndl made on measure .
I have the dark hair, I'm student, and my clothes are in second hand.
One thing, however, brings us together: • 3 minutes at Wiesn, photos already run against us and take photos to fill the memory of photos – very lighting, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends make us.
The Dirndl of two money seems to reach his goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and a resident in the north of the white salts equator, the sense of prosperity in the costum/abdomen until now remains in the limits.
But once they arrived to Theresienwiese, there's nothing serious.
Almost everyone brings the Dirndl or the skin bottles; no one looks disgusting or disappointed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's grab collects strange looks at the station of the bananas at the chocolate.
A monastery makes me note that I'd have lacked the grimbulle wrongly: "To the left you're free, to the center of six virgins, to the right, you're imprisoned, behind the widow."
I'm surprisingly systeming my shirt from behind to left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less slow of flirt-technical softs and carry on the soft hairs of bullet, on which it heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and shoot the naked deck against a non-invited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is named Bob, comes from England, and he also visits the Octoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a strascic "ooooo".
This tells me, after he was released from his beer mouth from a litre drinking before.
I really appreciate one of these hidrogens, of whom everyone thinks that it is a patumary.
Bob's supposed to be one of these "Wildbieslers".
Others have no happiness to get free of alcohol in this way.
Before the 8th evening they walk on the festival of Sana, which must take care of the poor goods
The nurses compiled every time in ↓co – always 4 once they dropped a tree of tent covered in the tent.
This works as with most of the visitors of Wiesn: it's going to be empty, returning full.
Who lies under the telone in this alcohol rate bar in the blood, you don't see.
"There are days, woe goarnimmer packn," calls one of the sane and disappears in the baronda.
victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman died in the hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was coin' on the incident Wednesday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was brought to Queen's Hospital, Romeford, but she died soon after.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the accusation of disabilities.
It was released on care.
Turkey is expanding the diplomatic horizontals
So much before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to deepen the Turkish hiterland.
On the east side of Bosforo, perhaps 20° in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful residues of this failing imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two Germans Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-rinascimental style.
This is at least what the tourist guides say to you.
The building is running between the end of the platforms with a tour on each of its angles, looking at the world as some German provincies.
The stone is crazy.
The whole building is quite low.
But once in the ticket office from the suffit once, there is no doubt about the size of the business of what was the most west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retirement to the Imperial, wanted to carry out its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was running to Baghdad and that which today is Saudi Arabia.
But the Imperial ambitions of Germany fell down during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The related isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the ice borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominatric forces went out of Egypt and stretched the Turks and their German covenants out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news too for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of munitions discovered by destroying his designed ticket.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, he has gone slowly in disappointment, widely overwhelmed by the story.
But today, this railway snoop for Anatolia and all the east points, they need - at least symbolically - to highlight the diplomatic horizontals ever bigger than Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The related isolation from its surrounding regions, generated from the ice borders of the cold war, has passed.
There is now a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To appreciate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I shiped on the vagone bed for the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the major experts in the AKP foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - approximately ten hours and half after - after a course of subbalts on the tracks that produced the old world's falls of the recent documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a centuries intentioned to turn the sprays to its ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known islamic roots represents an example of movement in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the O'e, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi brings me into the AKP general quarter, a ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built at hoc - in a subborg in development, surrounded by commercial centres of power building and pasticity, where manager in full business - both men and women - meet to make contracts for the first morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right policy of almost every other European political party.
I'm sure she had a Blackberry too.
"The objective of the external policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its neighbors.
The cold war was an anomalia," he says.
Turkey has been cut out of her entry.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or another.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point," I ask, "the Turkey will be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "nothing doesn't want to face that choice."
Then it highlights a point that almost all of those with whom I spoke here have been recited to memory: the links of not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucaso, and all around the Black Sea are benefiting from Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole Europe can metaforically run those railway lines to east through Asia and Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of these two German Gentilumanes Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu who have watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised it would be to find that the Middle-East ambitions of Europe can now be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look for the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through Bosfora, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then, at least it seemed not to be doubt about what continent should be advanced on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the coron.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the next year founded his wonderful young coro, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under the 21 years, but at the time Proteus sang his end in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years - we were denied to reject the coron.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutual) represented the good will of the core and the ability to face all that the music had to do, both madrigale and Messiaen, without association or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young core was often stupid, always citizen, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often it was told by Tod to let it be the music to speak for himself.
He said, "He knows what he wants.
There's everything in music.
So sing it!"
His technology in the use of the chat was absolutely clear and precise, even though never dictatory or flowered.
Whatever it was the musical standard, he made it always higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you had to appoint a horse manager would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which the Guildford Philharmonic led from 1962 to 1982.
I have been concerned over 100 of his concerts in the past 40 years, and I can honestly say that I have never been in agreement with one of the only ones - and many times inspired by ○.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the directors of orchestra that, in his words, "will run around the world one or two well known horses".
It'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he re-studied economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a laurea in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This results from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
Since 1946 to 1953, he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, in that period he completed a PhD tesis on the British Gomma industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published in 1958 as the British Ruber Industry.
He passed in 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for I°nois.
Because Woodruff chooses to cover this part of his car, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Filology
"Recommending the show of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y life", because his photos in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they send, even though they treat the protagonists with particular respect.
A demonstration that sends a lot of feelings.
Resino can catch magic moments."
Second accusation for the overseers of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the model had already been highly sustained, this new monovolume has an even larger internal space.
At all, it must be added a raffined mechanical, which increases the comfort of the drive and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz has a very similar line with the model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth signaling a innovative design, a new platform, larger and new mechanical dimensions.
However, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation's market entered.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other seas, there remains a unique phenomenon in fact of sales.
It is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and even during this 2008.
Just in Japan they have been sold almost a million Jazz units from the time of launch.
The second market was the old Continent, with approximately half million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase the sales in the segment.
Therefore, if the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model in 2007, the estimates would take around 100,000 cars for 2009, providing an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation, the Spanish branch offices expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the ark of a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to decrease the calamity of the sales in Spain.
In fact, the company's holdings are expected to reach at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold units, or 4,000 unless in 2007, with 16% delay.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, before 1.6% of the last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To help us, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-hour hybrid and a compressed format - 4,37 meters of length - of which the Japanese company expects to sell about 200,000 units per year throughout the world.
For the sea and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
In respect of the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 metres (fem meters in more), the width at 1.69 metres (two meters in more) and the intersection at 2.50 metres, with an increase of five metres.
The height, however, remains at 1.52 meters.
In addition to increased sizes, the inhabitable internal is also expanded.
This benefit results from one side of the insertion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel reserve in central position, a solution also adopted in the Jazz'e model.
Furthermore, the baggage’s ability – double background - is 399 litres, or 19 litres more the ability of the first generation.
It must be reported that these are the measures of the engine version 1.4 and that the baggageability of Honda Jazz ↓ is 379 litres.
Other improvements - besides external elements, such as the back leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - relate to improved accessibility to the back seats.
The doors that allow access to the post positions are, in fact, opened with an angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Moreover, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of the marketing, this small model will be proposed in the models with a benzine engine of 1,4 litres.
Both mechanisms include i-VTEC technology that reduce consumption, produce less carbon biocidal emissions, optimise the mechanism, and at the same time keeps the engine couple high in all its stages.
The litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv to 6.000 rounds with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4.900 rounds.
The propulsion – which in Jazz's eye reached the 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
In respect of the propulsion, which used 83 horses in the first generation model, now is available to 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 em.
The "ape car" to avoid elsewhere
In the context of the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired this time in nature, and in particular in the waters.
The Japanese company created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of the eggs, can avoid accidents.
It's the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first to the technology of prevention.
The Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of the Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in along with the Research Centre for Scientific and Technology of the Prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director-General of Public Relations on Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C has an extension of the Security Scud of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is increasing the ability to prevent the seats in the vehicles of the producer house.
Flights, every water creates a own personal oval form space that is very similar to Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the eye composed of the apples, which can be seen in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, which allow the insect to flight without interruption in his personal space.
In order to restore this visual feature, the engineers have pointed out what they have defined a location laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifys the obstacles that are before BR23C for a radius within the two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a board micro-screen that immediately prevents the employment.
"In the moment when it finds an obstacle, the small robot imitates the moves of an appee and immediately changes direction by turning on the roads to the right or greater angle to avoid the evasion.
The most evident difference with any assisted system is that the evasion manual is completely instinct.
"If it wasn't so, the robot would not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratorium and engine the head of this project.
In contrast to an ape, the robot can not move up or down, even in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction where it can turn his wheels and not use infinite directions and ways as they do the eggs.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid the sessions.
"This device only needs to prepare information every few seconds, and to act from these data.
Not required to store information or intuitive logic of the previous hands, so it can work without interruptions and only with a few dozens of KBs of memory.
This can surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not about me."
It is the first to develop new technologies for the timely prevention of the sessions, a technology that Nissan wishes will be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses bacteria to lithium polymers, which are more read and more hard than typology with lithium ions.
Another future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to destination by avoiding the obstacles present on the road.
Treme before requesting a loan
D We must assure that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not an enemy.
In front of the crisis and to avoid the Americans engaged with mutual discharge in doubt banks, they have created a fun and instructive for the users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits" or problems.
The tetra aspect of this systemation and, in particular, its receiptist needs to force to think not one, but two or three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do this, that is probably the primary objective.
Of course, the information that the provider provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more than one page for adolescents than a site for the large public.
What happens if it is completed?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house isn't even talking...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signature of an agreement with the UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a quota equal to 21% of participation in the Society, the news arrived after a net reference of its actions in Borsa.
One week after the summary of a preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's individual cost of $25.25, or a amount of $3 billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% than the accounting value of the licences by 31 August.
MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible credits to a conversion price of $31.25, guaranteeing a 10% income.
Morgan Stanley pointed out that the global operation would be carried out on a average price of 29 dollars, or a percentage less than 28%.
Near the 17.00, however, Morgan Stanley's title descended from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic covenant has an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into bank holding company," John Mack, director-General of the American Group, explained.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow you to distinguish its actions by making them, however, under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His legacy with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more predictive attitude than that.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that the agreement was amended in the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced the sale of 20% of its actions to the Japanese colossal for an amount of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our share would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But considering the current situation of the world and market, we have chosen to minimise the risks and protect us."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will receive Morgan Stanley titles at a lower price than their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would be translated with a investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis."
The Agreement provides that the MUFG can convert the half of its preferential tickets into ordinary actions in one year when, during a given period, these would have been exchanged over 50% under the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the MUFG's capital would allow you to collect investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
However, a portfolio of the group refused to provide specifications on the strategic projects of two new covenants.
After the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set up a solvency coefficient of animal One is approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has claimed to have "purely" attached its budget from the end of August.
In the last weeks, the group has proved hard, which has seen decreasing the value of its own actions while the cost of insurance against the risks has suddenly occurred.
The cost that reflues on Monday, however, remaining at a high level, is attracted to 12%.
Last week, the Goldman Sachs, the only other superstition" among the large Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' crown and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had acquired 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Funding the Republic on a socialism at the 21st century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales et of the ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the last one to give a vote to the project of a new Constitution.
The mission carried out since 64% of the electors voted "yes" to the referendum on a vote based on 80%.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while the 7% of votes were no, and 0.7% white sheets.
In order to adopt the Constitutional draft, it should be obtained half of the votes, more one.
Sunday, two investigations carried out at the outcome of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a victory of the "yes" slave, with it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had renounced altronde in the night between Sunday and on Monday the victory of his Constitution project.
The "Constitution trionphed gloriously", he assured, congratulating the equadorians in the Guayaquil governor, 280 km southwest of Quito.
As always, Chavez and Morales congratulated with Rafael Correa, as he did his cylean apology Michelle Bachelet.
The investigation, which was conducted in peace according to the electoral observation mission of the United States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" held by the President.
This Constitution project is dedicated to the power of the state on it, preserving "the planning of the development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and thus their currency.
Core, selected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of the State, which can be chosen for two follow-up mandates for four years, will have the opportunity to solve the asylum.
Correa has already announced the intention to use this amendment and to repeat its candidature for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freedom of san and education services that the president began to promote in this country 13,9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live under the poverty area.
It also prohibits the presence of strangers, the provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorian base as a point of department for American anti-drogue operations.
And 19 stops free in Ciad
A Egyptian commander launched the accusation to the rapitors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held prisoners in the wilderness for ten days have been reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released in Ciad from a Egyptian commander.
Apparently in form, the obstacles arrived to the military base of Stormaza, near Cairo's internal airport, to the 15th and 30th board of a special aircraft.
On the board of a helicopter, they were immediately transferred without allowing any print interviews, to Maadi’s hospital, a residential periferia of Cairo, to be subject to analyses.
They enjoy "good health" and no redemption has been paid "a sequestrators", said the Egyptian minister of Turism, Zoheir Garanna, on the trailing track.
On September 19, during a safari in 4x4 at the feet of Mount Ouanat, limited with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of obstacles was discharged by a hide to another of 35 unknown sequestrators.
The group was formated by 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian – and from 8 Egyptians: two guides, four autists, a guard of border and the director of Egyptus, the organizing agency of safari.
A Egyptian security officer claimed that 30 members of the special forces, on board of two helicopters, had launched the assalt during the night, shortly before the alba.
"There have been shots, half of the sequestrators have been u·sus, while the others have fled," he said the demanded to keep the anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "large" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commands.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini highlighted the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
D We must admit that if we have obtained this result, it has been thanks to the professionality and the capacity of men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding other details.
Moreover, it denied the payment of a redemption.
On the day before, the sudanese patrol exercise claimed that he had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the sequestrators were located and had six, including the Chadian leader of the rapitors, and that they had catched two.
According to the exercise, the sequencers would be linked to an organization of rebellion in Darfur, the movement for the Liberation of Sudan, (SLA_U), which was immediately denied by this last.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of the culture focused on the current electoral campaign.
So much better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in shadow.
Who will pronounce the poor amounts granted to the small museums, to them, to the archaeological squares or to the historical places?
What politicians will be able to refer to the federal government that is going to cross monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have true and own laws that actually preserve our possession?
Did you know that the French government pays three million and half euros for the only restoration of the city of Chinon in the valley of Loira?
By our American neighbors, the Constitution is to say that the protection of heritage is part of the culture and that the same inheritance must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every governmental department, and all this of common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Quebec History Societies Federation, at least 40 000 volunteers who, aggregated in 211 companies for the protection of historical, genealogic, patrimonial property and property, holded, with four money, private and archaeological sites.
They are exactly those who often hold our ownership, who protest with the energy of desperation when immobile immigrants and decisional organs attack our residues and cimiters forgotten with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved in history and inheritance?
Benelux governments have a part of Fortis
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization by the Belgian-Netherlands Fortis, which is in difficulties first in Europe for the American Credit Market Crisis: the three nations will provide 11,2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The Governments of the European Central Bank, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first large crisis in the difficulties in which the internal market has been discussed for more than one year is that of Fortis, and from a certain point, the decisions taken in this regard may constitute a matter.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States will delay almost half (49%) of the share of the present country.
It will sell almost securely part of its interests, including before all the assets, especially insurance, of the Netherlands ABN Amro bought a year ago.
Last week, Fortis's actions had started with a vertical crochet, serious signs of crises of the institution were then presented in the second half of the week.
The analystes, however, agree to think that it is too big to allow them to fail.
Wednesday's actions fall nearly 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January, the value of action has been decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total capital value of the group is about 14 billion euros, but, according to the leaders of the Action, this value is not real.
The company's top forces for Fortis' actions to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the American plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the title was slow to get out.
Wednesday Philip Dierckx was appointed a new delegated administrator.
The financial institution has also searched for private purchases, but no one has yet presented himself with a decent offer.
The Belgian Government already predicted that investors should not be afraid of money.
Among the customers of the customer, the branches haven't been discharged.
In Hungary, Fortis has autonomous branches and has also bought leasing dickets.
The puzzle in the pool
In America, insurers on life and health, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to establish an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"There is a program of privacy that the use of medicinal products for prescription depends, in any case, on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in indigenous hands, otherwise it's like to trust the pollay to the volpe" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the medicine prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance tariff and the exposure number in case of left-to-right health status of the customer and if they consider the risk too high, they shall not set the insurance.
The customer had to take a medical visit ago and the contract was established only after the exam.
Dick has invented a much more economic procedure for 10 years ago: based on the customer identification code, you can easily have information from the pharmacists you have purchased in the last and half year, and from this the programme evinces which diseases suffer and where health conditions are located.
For example, if you regularly buy large quantities of colesterol reductors that means that the fat level in the blood is in practice inequality high and is classified in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in the trade, some also determine the risk multiplicator, so the insurer does not remain much beyond the paperwork, even though there are small difficulties.
Among the opposers, some medicines are used for more purposes, for example, some components are inappropriate against empiry or warm vampy, but are also effective against depression.
This last, on the basis of the insurance point - commercial, value as the risk increase factor, the first two no.
For requesting and processing of data, the company has been formatted apart and, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacists, they ask the patient's approval.
The authorities now obligation them to do this even though they have not yet affected much for the disappointment.
Some recently develop the results of the tests and link them to the medical consumption data to provide a more precise image of the health status of patients.
They always have access to data and the control of use will be always more difficult.
There is a law on privacy apart, but its validity is only extended to sane services and insurance.
In front of the Congress, there is a legislative proposal which gives the authorities the power of control to specialised undertakings in the data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: therefore it has developed a programme that links the data forward to the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse the approval because otherwise the insurers do not establish the contract.
So then, at the end, the gallons are trusted in the clemence of the volpe.
Global marine
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who are mainly traded mutually, the agenda of the ninth meeting to the top has been dominated by this topic, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a franco-Indian top that will treat the first place of the cooperation on the Atomic Energy.
The European Union has the fact that India is being a great democratic power to be given more in internal matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support the New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
So he did not insist on this question at the ninth summit organized yesterday in Marsilla.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso President of the Committee and Javier Solana High Representative for Foreigners, received the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh, with which they found the agreement to double in 5 years, which is to increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has increased from 25 to 55 billion, this is not a very ambitious course.
The 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have therefore been united legally, so air traffic can also take the way in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the agreement.
The objective is to balance because, while the EU is the first trade partner in India, the New Delhi is only the nineth place between EU partners.
The headquarters gave attention to the global factors.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in the terrorism, this last condemned in all its forms of both parties, and encouraged the convocation of a United Nations conference.
They encouraged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, even though both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it continues in the energy and climate programme, so it would like to reduce at least 20% until 2020 the emissions of damage.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that it should establish a global agreement on the climate conference for the next year and reduce from 50% by 2050 the greenhouse gas production.
They also want to reduce the increase in the prices of food products and support the convocation of an internal meeting to examine the financial crisis.
Today the Prime Minister of India will be in the French capital where it will be prepared at a bilateral meeting to sign a Treaty on the Peace Use of Atomic Energy.
In Paris, it is expected that for building Indian nuclear reactions the French dictators receive a comma of EUR 20 billion.
According to our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Francofort more than 300 Italian editors
Fort presence of the Italian editors at the Internal Ferera of the Book of Francofort.
They will be more than 300 Italian editors present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important internal meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Internal Fiera of the Book of Francofort is waiting for this edition more than 7000 ex­ters from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the Fiera with more than 403000 titels in show and with Turkey as honor guests.
It will be the Supreme Secretary of the Ministry of Bens and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the ceremonie of insuration of the Italian Padiglione: Italy will be present with a Point of Italy - 264 square metres of ex-space.
It will follow the printing meeting at the Room Struktur in the Padiglion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of the editor in Italy.
According to data, the weight of foreign author books progressively reduces the total of Italian production, especially for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's airport, the billion lost a year ago
The airport of Steve Fossett was found, the billioner disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying in the wilderness of Nevada.
The rounds were found on a 3000 meters height, in the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the flight, however, there were no human residues.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fled the doubts still: "The air has been located, we have sent a square, and now we have the confirmation that it is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day when she disappears" said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore pointed out that no human residue was found in the air or in the surrounding area.
The billion, 63 years old, was given for death in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the release warning was sent a square of researchers, which then identified the equipment: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed from 3 September 2007, when Fossett deceived from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett were found by a couple near their habitation of Mammoth Lakes.
This is two documents named Fossett, both em. by the Federal Aviationation of I°Nois, of money in account and of a failure.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The billioner had won a place in the history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth temptation, he became the first man to complete the world's round on a steel: two weeks of flight solely.
Three years later, he had made the world round in a plane and without scale.
Among his so many records, also that he has flighted at 15.445 meters height, above the Andes, but with a childhot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with a original design and well defined by decision-line, wide surface and net angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the lastborn among the "compacts" of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new sale in this sector.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and will not agree also the communication that will accompanie the launch of Suv Glk at the showroom Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also start an unedified mode of communication through a future 3D Office campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of max-officials, recorded in three different stages, will dominate the central way of the milanish shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special eyes distributed near Corso How can you see the new Suv in almost real and in tridimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will have the impression that the car gets out of the manifest.
Successfully, through the use of innovative technologies Elumina8 the new Glk will be lighted in different times in all its details, and then recompensed in a single image.
Mercedes, of course, with this publicity, is trying to introduce something again in the stereotype field of car communication.
Will you be able with this formula to deal with the interest of the future acquisitors?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls whose whole Italy is now shameful? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group who follows the Nazzurra for years and who, for the truth, has never created excessive problems.
Never had struggled with the tifs of opponents.
The extract of the group is right.
Promotors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have been added to groups (may units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the soldiers: Sabbath night they were taken to be not identified.
They are inspired to the English phytosis.
In Bulgaria, they found a genuine nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian tifs 144 tickets for the game: all nominatives, so easily controlled.
And the Viminale had controlled them all: among those party for Sofia there was no one with a current Daspo, no one who was injured by attending a stage.
For four blue tissues, who had crimes from stadium, was rejected and prevented the transfer.
The Viminale now expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to those who have been arrested or to who have been identified in disorders.
A internal Daspo which prevents not only the Italian stages but also the entire Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, will no longer put their feet in a stage.
Fortunately.
But now there's the emulation, that is, to those little more than fifty, others are added.
"D we must spy this burning immediately and not legitimate those who do so," they support the Viminale.
So, "good eyes open, especially in view of the nay party of Tuesday in Lecce."
In Puglia, there is a small nucleo of Ultras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory is gathered, Wednesday the Casms can also count on a section of the Aise, namely secret services, which cares about stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce Core and the weakened arm during Mameli's wheat? In Bulgaria it isn't crime..."
This is the thinking (expressed in a very little way) of Domenico Mazzi®, a few weeks ago director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first from Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzi's presence was Trieste's here, where there was a nuclear of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, based in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzi said, that in Bulgaria there is no offense to induce the Duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 tifs has been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist - adds No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes are to be attributed in the country where the fact occurs.
Until now, this group was still in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we are also talking about the fissics in the middle of Mameli: even those I haven't sinned, but if you allow me to be not education..."
