Triomph of the right peoples in Austria, they have 29 per cent total
According to the preliminar results, the previous Parliamentary elections in Austria have made a sensitive deficiency of the two parties which are currently large coalition, as well as a significant strengthening of the popular parties.
The Austrian Popular Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers particularly important losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triomphale return on the political scene at national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the first political force of the country, however, compared to the elections of 2006, lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, who with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the voices, ended even worse.
This is the worst results of the two large parts of the after-government; in particular for the population party, who has initiated the previous elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
On the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the population party had a significant progress on the SPÖ.
However, the electors punished them for having abandoned the government.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible demission of the chief of the party and the current Wilhelm Molterer Channels were prononced.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday, in the extraordinary Council of the Partie's direction.
Such evolution would be easier for the outcome of the result of the choice that remains the most important, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, because of the strengthening of the two peoples in the right - the free (FPÖ) would have received 18 per cent and the BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed the fear of a repeat in 1999, when the population party agreed with the peoples (at the time, the FPÖ was still united, is that the BZÖ was separated in 2005 on a common government, which even raised sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who already said that he was ready to face with any party and that he predicted the return to Vienna at the national political scene, which appears to be put on this development.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Green, but they have lost and rebuild, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in the fifth position.
Of course, no other party is defeated by the four percent limit and is not accompanied by Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cold
If it was not possible to resolve the problem of the Czech researchers accused of illegal cafards in India, it would be, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refrigeration of the Czech relations.
The Minister declared it today in New York, after having met his Indian Pranab Mukherjee approved.
"If the problem was not resolved, then, some refrigeration would occur," he observed after the meeting, carried out on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, by exiting speakers, that the ex-effective power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Svácha, who was discharged from the accusation and sentenced by an amendment, the central government could negotiate with the local government, Darjeling, since the case was placed under the jurisdiction of this.
"The problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kuchera, sentenced to three years of prison, would be to call for a higher instance.
Therefore, he could ask for the freedom of caution and wait for the judgment in freedom, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner also expressed himself in the same sense during the speakers.
"The adviser to call for a higher court, after which it could be grateful," said the Chairman of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech side may intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "a competent legal support", mentioned by the Indian Minister.
He also said that such aid was already provided for them from India.
"We want above all to keep the best relationships with India, which have a tradition continued for many years.
The Indians also have it," says Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to the CTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic had great importance to the issue of Czech enthomology.
"We consider the prison and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great disappointment," he said.
The Minister asks the question if he has received the promise to take care of the case from India.
"I have already received a lot of promises," he simply said.
A Czech wants the fight for the Sea Fund
It approaches a mural electronic card, representing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
But he does not care for the continent, but at a small point lost in the ocean blue.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea fund.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and Sea Rights.
His boss, the director of the Division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and full time to another.
Work and enthusiasm characterizes the dominant atmosphere.
The marine fund hides a little famous world until now, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also live organisms for inconstant inconstants, which may contain the key to develop a drug against cancer.
A larger background than the closing earth
The literal states have started today to promote vice-meritage in the new sub-sea territories.
According to a United Nations Convention, they serve their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what the continental shelf is called, which has often been a number of hundred miles from the coast of the country.
This is the finality of the Convention to deal with all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered a continental shelf the part of the marine fund and its subsol, which is a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
It was beyond the limits of the literal sea, often more than two hundred miles of marine, representing that economic," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned present to the Commission for the establishment of the foreign borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation based on costous prospects and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparing work.
"One of our roles is to give the Committee legal and scientific and technical assistance.
The committee has so far taken five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries mentioned were known for the time," Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to consider, has extended its submarine property, has recently known a global resentment.
New Zealand, too, won the territory - the extension of the marine fund, which the Commission assigned to her last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the extension of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in the prospects.
The benefit they will have in the future of the marine fund's exploitation will be inevaluable, as they are designed.
Progressively, other countries will present their request.
They can do it within a decade of ten years after they have committed the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the Ocean Fund, proclaimed by the convention "Common Patrimoin of Humanity".
There, no State plays a position anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is attributed by an international institution established by the Convention.
"Nevertheless, we do not miss it, the sea fund is not a Klondike," he said by exagging director Mikulka, saying, "these areas are just defined and their scheme is enclosed in a contract."
Czechs in the field
Today, part of the marine fund belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former block of the East countries in the framework of the Common Interoceanmetal Organization.
This was obtained in 1991 in accordance with the Convention, as well as by investors from some other States, the status of which it is called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the areaClipperton in the Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor exceeds the surface of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moved there, this is a kind of submarine replique of Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on an expanded with a total surface of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich geising in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, cowber, cobalt and manganese," the Ind Pakshi Rajan, another legalist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian worker in the Division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It reminds a small pome of the earth, or, with a little imagination, the mythic shoem, which, the end, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on place for freedom of otage
The Egyptian Government had requested Germany for aid for the resolution of the otage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they have never passed to the action.
More details on the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists removed in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of Industry and the Defence Minister, the German special forces also participated directly in the safeguard operation.
Thus, both Federal Army specialists and officers of GSG 9 of the Federal Police Aircraft and Federal Police Office, as well as logistic experts of Technischen Hilfwerk have been found on the place of release.
As the Ministers' portfolio was on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, the chargeholders freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of freedom by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the basis of support force.
"This has not been done so far," stated a port of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers had removed the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and eight Egyptians.
After their removement into the wilderness south of Egypt, the otages were transferred into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of payment holders has remained too vague, as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
Those who have been saved in time have come healthy and unless to the Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released otages were under the protection of the German ambassade.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "bill", the five holidays and the special forces should have been assembled at a airbus of the air army and arrived in Germany March.
The United States Representatives Room is the Saving Plan
The first room of the American Congress has failed to save financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was stuck in the abom.
With 227 votes against 206, the United States representatives' room rejected the safeguard plan for the financial markets of the Government.
Despite all the calls of the President of the United States George W. Bush and political men at the head of the two parties, the programme that had to join the chaos of the financial markets did not obtain the majority.
In a dramatic manner, the parties had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-based plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, called the Members to a favourable vote, although the plan was inevitable.
"It is difficult to have political ability to avoid something that has not yet happened," he agreed.
The vote was still reduced by Dow Jones by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state-saving plan could lead to.
He left a little while before the end of the vote, for then, after the report of the failure, again to fall.
Experts are now designing new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme, the approval and the room of the Members and the senat are necessary.
Organizators report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
As regards reservations for the next months, the business number has just increased in comparison with the next year - for winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite low conjournal perspectives, German travel suit remains insatisfactory in this study.
With regard to the reservations for winter season, the travel agencies have registered a number of businesses more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the same year, as the German Travel Agencies (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Markets Research Institute, increased booking numbers already dominate the months of automne.
Thus, the number of wins would have gripped up to 11 per cent compared to 2007, confidential to the DRV.
The sources of these results are the numbers of the GfK, which analyses 1200 travel agencies a monthly and makes estimates for the global market.
Reserves of travel from the end to 2008 would be recorded there.
As a result of the low dollar course, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, stated the DRV.
There the reservations would be about a Animal.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be particularly targeted by Germans.
The specially organized travels are very requested, explained by the DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of increased energy prices and food prices, the costs would be "easier for the customer than for a individually organized travel".
Consumers can economy money, inter alia, with the reductions of the preliminary reservations or all Inclusivie offers, explained Laepple.
The elderly months have also been very kept so much that a increase in the winning numbers will be recorded again as compared to the last year - although another study, the number of Germans who entered a travel has been decreased in comparison with the year.
My first time at the Beer's Festival
Ballermann or Apres-Ski's hits continued, beer in pickets to litre and collections in Tyrolian costumes to design.
A event at the beer's festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we do not have a lot in common.
It is blonde, television animator and carrying a tyrolian costume on measurement.
I've got my hair, I'm a student, and my dress is a chance.
But one thing relates to us: almost three minutes at the beer's festival, and the photographs already go on us and fill their memory map - very flat, and this at my first visit at the beer's festival.
That's how we make friends.
The tyrolian good market costume → reach its goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally resident north of the Whitewurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was until now limited.
But once on the Teresa place, everything is half worse.
Each or almost wear a tyroline costume or cow bottles; no one seems to be disturbed or affected by shame - it's totally normal.
Only the table of my tyrolian costume collects a few bizarre eye shops at the stand of the chocolate-bananas.
A bavarois notes me that I would have wrongly attached my table: "to the left means free, in the middle of the widow, on the right side of the widow."
Discretely, I tripato my lock back to the left.
"It's better," she said.
Others are not so bad for these flirt technical subtils and have simple flavors on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us to their back-train without being invited there.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer's festival.
He finds this "gorgeous" with a "oooo" alonged.
He's getting all this to me after he's deceived the shoe he had been drinking before.
○ at the side of this burning mouth that everyone thinks to be a powder.
Thus, Bob is one of these sadly famous soldiers.
Others don't have the chance to get out of alcohol in this way.
Nearly eight hours of the evening, scarlets fall on the place of the festival and have to take care of poor drinks.
Instead, the guards enter into myth - always by four, they draw their wide cover of tents in tents.
This works for most visitors of the Beer Festival: we go empty there, we return full of it.
Those who rest in the circle of the drunken beaches are not low.
"These are those who can't go away anymore," one of the scholars cries to me in response to my question and disappears in the midnight.
The victim of the police is identified
A 63-year-old petroleum, died at the hospital after a vehicle had been married, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in Friday after midnight, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died later.
Following it, a 51-year-old man was arrested because suspected of dangerous conduct.
He was released since, in caution.
Turkey extended its diplomatic horizons.
While before Turkey was thinking to join the European Union, the European powers were quick to go back.
On the side of Bosfore, at 20 steps, it may be, in Asia, one of the most ends of his emperor ambition.
Hydarpasha’s garage was designed in a newbornness, by two German teachers, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
This is at least what the guides give us.
The monument is available to horses at the bottom of the platforms, observation tours to each of its angles, as some German provincies.
The stones are sweet.
All the building is in ruin.
But once inside the voted ticket, we have no doubt more about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The garage was incurred in 1908 by a German, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retardate to the Imperialism game, wanted to perform its median domination ambitions through this iron road that arrives to Bagdad, as well as the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions were exhausted during the First World War.
His works were attacked by Lawrence of Arabic and its Arabic irregularities.
The relative isolation of its region around, born by the ice borders of the Froze War, is completed.
. The British and Empire's forces went outside Egypt and moved the Turks and their Germans outside Palestinian and Others.
But there were bad news for Hyderpasha's holiday.
In 1917, a loaded train of municipalities exploded destroying its subtil tooth.
The Turkish sources say that it is a sabotage.
Since, she has fallen slowly in ruin, involved in the story's midsts.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the east points, at least symbolically, is to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The Partie of Justice and Development to the Power, the ACP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolation related to its region around, born by the ice borders of the Frozen War
Now it's time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has noteworthy relations with Israel and the Europe, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I shiped on a carrier-lift in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish AKP Suât Kiniklioglu MP, one of the experts in foreign policy.
On the next morning, after a travel of 10 hours and half, surrounded on brunching rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I would finally, in the Turkish capital presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known islamic racines represents an example of change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me at the ACP general quarter, a modern ultra structure, expressly built in stones and steel, in a development quarter, around half-build trade centres and many pastures in which the medium-cost-cravate-men and women managers meet for maternal businesses.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right center politician from any other part in Europe.
Costume, cravate, and he even has a Black Berry.
The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now in its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an error," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of each other.
She had to do both of them.
"but here at a certain time," I asked if" should Turkey not choose?"
"Turkey" said, "not want to choose between both."
He then highlighted an aspect that almost all of those with whom I could talk, rejected me with heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East but also to the Caucase, and around the Black Sea, so it is a benefit for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message ↓ of a Europe traveling metaforically on railways to Asia and the Middle East.
Returning to the Hydarpasha holiday, after another night without sleep, I repeated to these two Germans, Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who followed the building of this building there are 100 people.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could mostly be in the hands of Turkey.
While I attended the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosfore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called "the illness of Europe".
At least there is no doubt on the continent that could be said to this fascinating country.
Remembers of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music officer at Guildford since 1962, the Vermon "Tod" Handley (determined on 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The heart had to include less than 21 men, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years left the heart.
The name "Proteus" (which changed mythology) represented the will and ability of the heart to manage any kind of music to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical diversity produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, and this by inspiring one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated us to "leave music speaks for herself".
He would have said, "The compasser knows what he wants."
It's all here, in music.
So you sing!"
His baggage technology was absolutely, precisely, even if never dictatory or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he was higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver had to be called a horseman, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Philharmonic Guildford.
In the last 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that no one of them has ever disappointed me and sometimes they have even inspired me
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the leaders who, he, "concentrate only on certain people".
He'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (determined on 25 September) states that "In 1946, he had recovered his economic studies in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he did a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is what's been issued by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time ended a phD tea on the British plastic industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; then it was held in 1958 under the title The British Ruber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he was studying at Houblon Norman, and the sea of 1952 at the universities of I°nois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for I ́Nois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissimulate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophe
"I recommend the exposure of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary, are fantastic.
They attached me to the fact of their simplicity and strength they sent and because they always treated protagonists with a lot of respect.
A exposure that transmits many feelings.

Second review for Honda's super ventures
In November, Honda will begin the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his pre-decessor already had a good habituality, this new monovolume has a even larger internal space.
This is a few raffined mechanisms that increase the comfort of conduct and allow more importance to economy.
A development faces a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line with the model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them there is a innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before reviewing the new model, it must be highlighted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the marketing of the first generation.
On the other hand, it is noted that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than the other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of wins on other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and 2008.
Exactly in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than one million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda predicts that this new Jazz will allow him to win his wins in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 it thought that it would sell 100,000, which would represent a growth of 17 % on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's wines in Spain.
The responsibility of the Spanish branch hopes to sell 2.000 Jazz in a year.
This is exactly the outcome of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to pall in large part the decrease of the wines in Spain.
In fact, the responsibility of the mark hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, or a decrease of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in winning, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% in the past year.
Japanese mark also expects a market share of 2 % in 2010.
Honda hopes that part of the market when the new model is going out.
This is the Insight, a five-hour hybrid and a compact size - 4,37 meters of length - on which the Nippone company hopes to market about 200,000 cars per year throughout the world.
According to markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the Insight wins will be made to the United States, while the other half remaining will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned during the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valence.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 metres (five meters additional), its width of 1.69 metres (two meters additional) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five metres.
However, the height does not change at 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the internal space also.
This winning is, on the one hand, due to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to introduce a reservation in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the coffre - which has a double fund system - may contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in addition to the first generation's coffre.
It is necessary to report that these dimensions are the ones of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the coff of Honda Jazz ↓L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as back fires or panoramic toilet - is the improvement of access to back places.
The gates that provide access to the back seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, along with the back doors of the first Jazz, which would be opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new about this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two extent propulsors of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
The two engines have an i-VTEC which reduces the extent consumption and CO2 emission that makes the engine stronger and increases the engine system.
The first engine 1,2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6.000 t/min and 114 Nm of a couple at 4.900 t/min.
This propulsor - on the Jazz - reached 78 horses - presents a consumption of deficiency of 5.3 litres to 100 km and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
In comparison with the propulsor, who reached 83 horses on the generation, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres to 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'After vehicle' that avoids the events
In order to promote the development of aes prevention, Nissan inspired himself, this time, of nature, particularly of appeals.
The Japanese company created a robot that, imitating the flight of appeals, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps to prevention.
The Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have constructed this small robot with the Centre for Sciences and Advanced Technologies at the Prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General for Public Relations on Technology and Research and Development of Marks, the BR23C represents the resort of the Nissan security bucket.
This robot will enable vehicles in the mark to prevention of ́sions.
Its flights, each bullet created its own personal space in a oval form that makes much in the Nissan security bulk.
But the most important are the eyes of the bullet, which are able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows him to steal without interruption within his own personal space.
To regenerate this visual function, the engineers pointed out what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles located on a distance of two meters and in a 180 degrees radiation, calculating the distance to this object and sending a signal to the micro-emissioner immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a knife and will immediately change the direction by sharing his wheels of 90 degrees or more to avoid the evasion.
The largest difference in any other existing system is that the evasion process is completely instinct.
If so, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explicate Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory of Movement and main engineer of this project.
In contrast to a cow, the robot can not be turned up or down or diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow him and not in infinite directions like the cows.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only handle information and act these data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of pre-working, so it can continue with only a few dozens of KB memory.
This can be surprised, but we don't speak of giga-bytes of memory, nor even of megabytes."
This represents the first reason for the development of new continuous preventions, which will be introduced into the series cars in a decade of years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are more and more longer than lithium-ions bacteria.
The other possible application of this could be the adjustment of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being hypothetic.
It is necessary to recognize that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, does not have genius.
In view of the crisis, and to avoid the Americans to be shiped in hypothics with solvency banks, they created a game to avoid failing: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
It's to say "The Hostel of bad credits" or stories.
The luguary aspect of this apartment and especially the Master of Hotel led us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, especially where to do it.
Of course this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a booked game for adolescents.
What if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entrance at his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will deduce nine billion dollars to take 21% of his capital, a new receipt by a strong decrease of its course in Bourse.
One week after a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a single price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The reserved price is lower than 19% to the accounting value of the loans at 31 to 31.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible tickets which provide 10% in return and awards a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be effected on the basis of a average unit price of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley's action lost 6.79% to $23.07 at $17:00 GMT.
"This strategic covenant is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the holding status," explained John Mack, the Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must allow him to diversify its activities, but the fact that it passed under the Authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much greater attitude than previously.
Moreover, the procedures presented on Monday show that the agreement had been made during the last days: Monday, Morgan had just announced that he would sold up to 20% of its actions to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"For a week ago, Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the ex-director of MUFG, said, "We pension that participation would be completely composed of actions.
But in view of the current situation of economy and market, we wanted to reduce the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its titles to Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The Agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert the half of its preferential titles into action in one year if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, or about 47 dollars during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will allow him to enter investment opportunities, strengthen its balance and enhance its liquidity.
However, a keyword of the group has made a specification of the strategic projects of the two new alliances.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show an area of solvency of approximately 15%, one of the best of the sector.
Morgan indicated that he had "rightly" allocated his balance from the end to the end.
The last weeks have been testing for the group, who has seen his course of Bourse for half, while the cost of insurance against a deficiency risk on its debt was involving.
This cost reflues Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "on-to-doing" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the faillites of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's racket, announced that they had lifted up 15 billion dollars, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refund the Republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, Bolivien Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, as regards its approved and friends, was the third who voted on a new Constitution project.
As 64% of the electors voted "yes" to the referendum, the official results of 80% of the subsequent issues.
According to these results, "no" received 28%, 7% of the suffocations were nuls and 0.7% were white votes.
In order to adopt the Constitutional draft, half of the suspects had to be adopted more than one.
Saturday, two reviews carried out at the outcome of the vote offices and an account of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of "yes", which was between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also revengeed on Sunday night on Monday the victory of its Constitutional project.
"The Constitution triomphed in a huge way," he assured the Equatorians at the Guayaquil Government seat at 280 km southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chavez and Morales, but also his chilian approved Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in the peace of the United States Observation Mission (OEA), was on a text in 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The Constitutional draft is dedicated to the power of the State on Economy, preserving "the planning of development" of a country living in primary way for the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the devises sent by its emigrants.
In 2006, the draft, chosen in Corea, also grants strengthened powers to the head of the State, which will be able to carry out up up to two conscious mandates for four years and will have the opportunity to solve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and take a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of freedom of health and education services that the Chairman began to establish in this country of 13.9 million residents, where 50% of the population live under poverty level.
It finally provides the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial base as a point of department of American anti-drogue operations.
The 19 otages were released in Chad
A Egyptian command launched the assault against the ravisors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captives for ten days in the wilderness were returned on Monday afternoon in the Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released by a Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, the otages arrived at 15 hours 30 at a special plane on the military base of Al-Maza at the International Airport of Caire.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, at the board of helicopters to Maadi's hospital, a residential campaign of Cairo, to take a review.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the ravisors," the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, said on the Tarmac.
Captured on 19 September at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of otages had been cut off from a cache to another by 35 inconsiders.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian Agency, safari organizer.
A Egyptian security responsibility pointed out that 30 members of the special forces, shiped by two helicopters, had launched the suit in the night just before the abe.
"An exchange of fire shots has occurred, and half of the ravisors have been killed, the others fleeing," said the responsibility that requires anonymity.
He pointed out that 150 members of Egyptian special forces of the "Lighting Unit" were totally sent to Sudan, where they received support for German and Italian commands.
The leader of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without more details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudan army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle at the board of which the ravisors were killing in six, including the Chadian head, and holding two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebellious group of Darfour, the Movement of Liberation of the Sudan Unit (SLA-U), which this movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes manchettes and takes place in this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to declare the sums of misfortune given to small museums, archives, archaeological fo's or national historical places that are hungry?
Which politician is going to remind the Federal Government that he disturbs his monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our possession?
Did you know that the French government dedicated three million and half of euros to restore the only Chinese castle in the Valley of Loire?
In our neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elections and all government departments, and that, in concertation.
In Quebec, at the Quebec History Society Federation, at least 40 000 volunteers grouped in 211 historical, heritage, archives and genealogies are concerned about footing the history, keeping with three under private archives and keeping archaeological clothes.
These are, often, the watch dogs of our heritage, which protest with the energy of the despair when promotors and decisions launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cimeters.
When, a court for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are assisted to the Belgian-Netherlands bank, as the first European institution in the situation of distress after the effect of the snow-building crisis of the credit market in the United States, by nationalizing it partially, and the three countries support, at a sum of EUR 11,2 billion, the financial and insurance institution also owned in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, by calling to the European Central Bank and to the responsibility for the competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first large crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been enhanced for more than one year is for the Fortis bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy nearly half (49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will certainly sell a part of its participation, among which, firstly, activities, mainly insurance, that it has acquisited last year of the Netherlands ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis action started a vertiginous fall. In the second half of the week, serious crisis signs have already been revealed at the bank.
The analystes agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to the failure.
Nothing on Friday, the company's actions fell 12 per cent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, more than two thirds of their value have fallen into action.
Taking into account the current value of the actions, the total value of the group's capital turns around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's leaders, is not real.
The direction of the company accuses the outer-Atlantic uncertainty, in relation to the adoption of the American Saving Plan of 700 billion dollars, to be the result of the fall of Fortis action.
Monday, papers have already benefited from an increase.
Wednesday, Philip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank as a new general director.
Finance was also seeking private purchases, but has not yet received a proposal on the basis.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors would not be concerned, they would not lose their money.
No panic has been felt in the bank client circle and no agency has been adopted.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also bought leasing companies.
A river in the powder
In America, life insurance and health companys often sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their medical purchases.
Experts in the protection of information fear that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"The data protection programmes read the use of information on the prescription of medicines, in any case, in the agreement of the person concerned.
This type of program must be between independent hands, otherwise it is again to grant his pupiler to a renard," Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage medical prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and capital in the case of damage, the health status of the customer present, and if they consider that the risk is too large, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination and signed a assurance contract with them only after having received knowledge of the results.
Since ten years, Dick has found a much less decent procedure: from a number of identification, it is easily provided to pharmacists, data on the purchases of personal medicines in the past eight months, and from that, the programme himself decides what disease the person suffers and what is his health status.
For example, if this person regularly purchases high doses of cholesterol reductor, it refers to an extremely high grass rate in the blood, which causes it in a higher risk category.
A number of versions of this programme are increasing, and some determine at the same time a risk coincidence, so there is no greater thing to do to the insurer other than the paper. However, small problems can still occur.
Among the challenges of this programme, it is found that a medicine can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against ́akin or heat buffets, but may also be effective against depression.
This last is considered by the insurers as a major risk factor, while the other are not.
Some companies developed in the research and analysis of data, and they must ask the patient for the treatment before collecting the necessary information to the pharmacist.
They are therefore restricted by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctified for their lack of past.
Some companies have also treated the results of laboratory analysis and have linked them to the data related to drug consumption, so they are able to provide a more precise portrait of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use becomes even more difficult.
There is a distinct law on the protection of medical data, but its field of action was only for practicers and insurers.
A legislative proposal on the extension of the control circle of authorities in relation to specialised undertakings in the data supply is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that it is not sufficient and that it has developed more before its programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to grant or not its agreement, as if it does, the insurance does not sign insurance contract with her.
Thus, and at the end of the account, the powders have the well-being of the renard.
The Global Menu of Marseille
The European Union and India multiplies their trade trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners, this subject also dominated the agenda of this ninth top of the other problems, in large part.
Today, there will also be a summary of France-India where it will be particularly the issue of the cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great democracy power to which it should be given a widespread law in international matters, but the Member States have not yet agreed on their support in New Delhi for its candidature as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They did not look too much on this issue yesterday at this nineth top organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the leader of the diplomacy, Javier Solana, accepted the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply by two trade trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has passed from 25 billion to 55 billion, it does not seem to be a very ambitious goal.
In this regard, they harmonised the 26 bilateral conventions with India regarding civil flights, and thus air exchanges will also be able to take their interest in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with one side, India, which is the first trade partner of the EU, and the other, New Delhi, which is only the nineth place of the EU partners.
The summit dedicated his attention to global matters.
The Afghanistan and Pakistanian situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the need to hold a United Nations conference on this issue was emphasized.
The end of the Doha trade cycle was also requested, although both had a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would be able to reduce at least 20 percent of its toxic rejections until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, and with the fact that a global market should be passed on the conference on climate for the next year, and reduced the emission of gases with a heat effect from 50 per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent the increase in the prices of food goods, and supported the convocation of a international work meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The leader of the Indian State is today in the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he is prepared to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is expected that French companies will receive orders for a value of 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian Atomic Reactors.
According to the information of the press agency, the agreement would be 15 years old.
In France, more than three hundred Italian editors
Fort presence of Italian editors in the International Book of Francfort.
More than three hundred Italian editors presented in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Room of Frankfurt waits for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 17°790 square metres of the Room with more than 403 miles of exhibitions, and Turkey as an invitation to honor.
This will be the Secretary-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government during the inauguration ceremonie of Papillon Italy: In fact, Italy will be presented institutionally, with a Point of Italy-264 square metres of exhibition.
It will follow the press meeting in the Struktur Room in the Bukmessa Papillon 5.0: a opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books is gradually decreased in comparison with the total of Italian production, and in particular with the importance of adults and children.
He found Steve Fossett's plane, the billion missed a year ago.
Steve Fosset's airport, the billioner disappeared on 3 September 2007 while he was flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris were found on a plate of 3000 meters height, in the area of Sierra Nevada of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human residue.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, overcome the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is good about that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day when he was disappeared," he said at a press conference.
So the sheriff indicated that no human remaining was found on the plane or around.
In February , the billion of 63 years was considered to be dead .
The American Transport Safety Bureau (Ntsb) noticed that a few hours after the epave, a team of researchers sent on the sites, identified the device: it is well from Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset collected from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from Nevada's border, some personal effects from Fosset were found by a couple around their habitation in Mammoth Lakes.
This is two documents called Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation of I°Nois, Specific money and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The billioner had won a place in the history through a long series of records.
In the sixth trial, he became the first man to complete the world's tour on a aerostatic ballon: two weeks of solitaire flight.
Three years later, he had made the tour of the world in a plane and without scale.
Among all these records, also the one who stole at 15.445 meters height, on the Andes, but with a baby.
Glk, the publicity you don't have.
A 4x4 outside of the commune of an original and well-defined design, on the marked lines, on the net surfaces and corners.
This is, in synthesis, Glk, the lastborn of the "compacts" of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its standard, unexpected and not conventional content will be the communication that will accompanie the launch of 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising that will accompany the beginning of the new car will take place in an unfair way of communication through a future 3D showing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of max shows, old in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the milenian shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and through special lunches distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in tridimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the picture, the car's out of the office.
Then, through the use of the innovations Elimina8, the new Glk will be lighted up the spots in all its details to then compose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this publicity, Mercedes is trying to introduce something again in the stereotypic area of car communication.
Will she succeed with this formula to enhance the interest of the future acquisitors? We will see it well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy has shameed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group who follows the Italian national team for years and who has never grown great problems until now.
He never was heated with the adverse tifosos.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups of Campania and the Poês (really) have been held in Sofia.
They had tricolor flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed to not be identified.
They are inspired by the English fiosure.
In Bulgaria, they found a timor of true Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 billets for the part: all nominatives, and so easily controlled.
And the Viminal had actually controlled them all: among those who went to Sofia, no one had a current Daspo, no one had been prohibited to frequency a stage.
Four Italian tifios who had previous stage crimes, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not move.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take measures: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purify a Daspo for at least five years.
A international Daspo prohibiting the frequency of the Italian, but also European stages.
Shortly, our hooligans won't stop the stage.
Good luck.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: it is that others are risking to be in the first hundred fifty.
"We have to extinguish this burning immediately, and not stimulate who does this," supports the Viminal.
So "keep the well open eyes, especially for the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Poes, there is actually a small node of Ultras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, is secret services, which are just concerned about stage problems.
"The hearts of Duce-Duce, and the arms stretched during Mameli's himn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
This is the opinion (really not pleasant) of Domenico Mazzi, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzi® was previously predicted in Trieste, where there is a node of supporters of the Ultras Italian group, based in 2002.
It is true, as said Mazzi®, that in Bulgaria, praise Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - the observatory number 1 - crimes must be assigned in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group remained in the rules, now we will see what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about syfflets towards Mameli's himn: those there are not crimes, but if you allow me, they're not cops..."
