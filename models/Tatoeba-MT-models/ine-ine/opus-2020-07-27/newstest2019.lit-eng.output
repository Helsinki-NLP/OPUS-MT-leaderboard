Ethical Servants: Liberal Conscience Government on the Rights of the Division of Vilnius
"The decisions adopted by the Government are in accordance with the statute," the BNS reported its leader Vitut Tamošiún after the Commission meeting.
"Our decision was not a new thing.
Explaination as a Commission has already been made in July when there was a question about the Pogueria and Utena.
Then we said that this is the question of the manager's competence under the statute.
And if the Board decides that any section may act as he wants - to go with the committee and accept it, then the Chapter may go, but if the Board decides that there will be part lists of what the Government has accepted and accepted, then it is the decision that all sections will form part lists.
And if I don't go with the Government, then it's been able to stop the membership and go with the committee," it adds.
According to Mr Tamošiún, the Government of the Parties now decides on further actions.
On 17 October, the Government of the Liberal Council of the Party dismissed the resolution of the Division of Vilnius to participate not with the party, but with the list of the Committee on New Burrows.
The Board of the Parties considers that the decisions of the Government of the Parties in the form of the Communication Committee have violated the statute of the Parties.
By 31 October, the Chapter of Vilnius had to refuse to participate in the list of the committee.
But the chapter did not.

In Northern India, the tractory of the village was trained by the trectory, which had previously found one man, the officers reported on the morning.
Forest overseer Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kudžlagis) said that soon after Saturday, the neighbors were driving a man in the fields, and the neighbors dropped the beast, and, trying to escape, they dropped it into a tractory.
Lifemen say that this trick had been stumbled about 10 days ago and dressed one young person.
The neighborhood is in the Dudhvos Tiger community in Lakhympur Kheri, about 250 km southward from Utar Pradesh.
It is prohibited for tigrus in protected areas.
Director Ramesha Pandey (Ramesh Pandij) said that the police would be informed in accordance with the Law of Nature Nature on the case referred to.
On April Sunday, the neighbors in the Neighbourhood region of Utar Pradesh struck another tiger, which had severe violations.
The Tiger is a national person in India; in accordance with the Law of the earthly Nature, it is considered to be a destructive species.
The previous year’s data show that at least one person dies during the previous three years with tiggers or drambs each day.
Human conflicts with tigers are gradually increased from the 8th decade when India started the Tigers Programme, which sets up the tigres in national parks, and the finality of big cats began to be maintained by crime.

Proposal cats and dogs for obligation labelling in microschemes
Chairman of the Committee on the Environmental Environment, Mazeka, together with the other members of Simea, registers the correction of the law on the welfare of animals and the rights proposed for cats and dogs to be bindingly labelled by subsequent microschemes.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled by poody microschemes, and that their registration and labelling will organise the location of compatibility, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In the year 2019, the state funds will be freely labelled by all dogs, and 2020 - still cats, and thus will live in the fields of business and cover a specific state-predicted financing," said the President of the Committee on the Environmental Affairs of the Seem.
The legislation is intended to determine the systemic signature of domestic animal labelling.
the hope that this will help to avoid problems results in the unresponsibility of human plants, illegal multilaterals or sellers.
Preliminary estimates are estimated that, in accordance with the expected price of microschemes and services for approximately 5 euros, transitional period will be respected for all human operators.
The total price of all human plant labelling may be up to 6 million euros.
It is planned to divide funds within three years and each year after 2 million euros.
The programmes for labelling will be assigned through a special programme for the environmental welfare, which will significantly increase in income in this year due to the replacement of natural resources and resources increased in this year.
These funds can be used not only for the labelling of cats and dogs but also for castrations and other programs.
According to Mr. Mazeki, the binding labelling practice has been spread in almost all European countries, which allows the same animals to be easily returned to the owners, and has agreed on the time of the human plants themselves when the escape and submission of planting should be assigned a lot of time and resources.
Furthermore, the EU legislation provides that several aspects can only be made with deteriorated plants.
At the same time, the marking suggests to be responsible for a person’s whole life.
Previous proposals were obliged to mark the opposition because the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the resources of the population.
"The model of this criteria should now be avoided because the humans proposed to finance increased income in the environmental framework programme and the right to label not only for veterinary treatment but also for publics, i.e. the person of human global institutions, who have heard special courses in the veterinary academy," says the authors of the project.
The draft legislation is registered to the different Seimo-groups of members of the Seim-resident-Gruppe of the Mazeka, Algimant Dumbrava, Eugenia Gentville, Edmund Pupinis, Rimas Andriks, Antan Vincus and others.

This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the shore was Sunny's dog!
I thought that if I had a dog, he would really be big and serious.
I've never seized those small, decorative fifs four.
However, during the Sunny film, I was so convinced that the sympathy became both sides, and I finally even bought her to buy her from the phone, but it was unfortunate," she laughed.

On Wednesday, the Opotic Group of the Christian Democrats of Simea and Lithuania (TS-LKD) reported that the group of members of Seim was sent to the CT in order to examine the conformity of the Law of Residue Management adopted by the Governors.
"Parlamentaries stress that the provisions of the law are intended to celebrate projects of waste fuel devices currently in order to establish new restrictions to the Government (20 km from the residue territory) until the layout of the law in Vilnius and Kau's burning forces started in the House," it states in the report.
"Parlaments note that, in the light of how the prohibition for the establishment of residue management objects (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of "live territory"), it is concluded that this prohibition is unproportionally restricted or even restricted to the right to carry out agricultural activity relating to the fuel of waste, the importance of establishing the ability to formulate so that, after assessing the nature and distribution of Lithuania in the country, the establishment of such objects in the entire country is practically unable," it adds.
Let us claim that the law adopted is contrary to the principle of the constitutional law.
"The CT has not once indicated that legislation does not apply to legal facts and effects that have occurred before the new adopted legislation.

By setting such a legal regulation to violate the principles of legal certainty, legal security, legal expectations, thus also the constitutional principle of the legal state.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kauna.
By stoping projects currently, the State would not only experience hundreds of financial losses, experience of deficiency losses and Lithuania's lives - increased heating prices due to increased environmental deterioration in the deterioration of residues.

Repeatment of the laws adopted by the Court of Justice from 1 January 2019, the Governors propose to reject 20 km limitation.
This section is planned to be discussed at the Seimo Round Session.
However, the Government's right to stop projects already started is not planned.
The CT will be the process of this case - not before a year.

LeBrono James's carrier starting in the Los Angeles' Lakers Club is not the same as he, the organization and the honorary.

Explained by the "Lion Air" flighting disasters to deal with: the dead's artificial influence
The data of the black box of the Indonesian air cartridge of the Indonesian air carton show that the investigators reported at least four last of his last speed injury.
The President of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) said that the similar orientation was held within four last flights, the latter, when the other fell on October 29, immediately after the release from Jacarta.
During this catastrophe, all 189 flights died.
A lot of newsletters reported that the airport "Boeing 737 MAX 8" from Denpasar to Indonesia's throne.
"When we opened the black box - so, the technology problem was a speed of air, otherwise, the speed of the flight," Mr. Tahjon said through the pressure.
"The black box data showed that over two times before the travel Denpasar-Jakarta also was the same problem," added he.
"In social networks, a lot of shepherds have gone.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (the data came out) about four aspects that caused problems with the speed air speed," said the leader of the NTSK.
During the meeting with the members of the fishing acts, Mr. Tahjon said that the recording information of the device corresponded to the notifications that the speed and height of the last operation of the aircraft would be changed unreasonablely.
The search team has not yet been found in the second black box recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
"Lion Air" pointed out that it was made in accordance with the recommendations of the parent.
One of the company's officers Rusdi Kirana was not invited to submit to the meeting minister Budi Cari Sumadi, the meeting of the members of the Moderate members with the officers, the investigation of the aircraft and residues and the investigation of the disaster.
However, he stood up and pushed his head when the members of the invasive and intergovernmental members claimed that Mr. Kirana, together with his brother Cusnan in 1999, would be added to "Lion Air".
"Lion Air" did wrong," said the man, set up as a passenger Shandy Johano Ramadhan, a prosecutor in the island where the airplane was flying, father.
"From Mr. Rusdy Kiran and his team would take attention," he stressed.
From the beginning of the crisis, the Lion Air has never touched me.
We're not running our child, but "Lion Air" didn't show us any resources.
After this meeting, Mr. Kiran quickly disappeared, avoiding issues of journalists.
Many are waiting for the results of the recognition of the dead.
Police medical experts have been transmitted to nearly 140 lavone-master parts of people's support.
Only 14 days have been recognised until now.
Parents asked the question when the other one started two months ago was allowed to flee, although, on October 28, the deepest of Bali to Jacart, the flight of the passengers who were scared of the flight was thrown down immediately after the rise.
"Lion Air" said that this shipment was aligned.
Is it true that the problem was exhausted? - asked one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technology must be responsibility.
The law was very clear, not they claimed that the aircraft was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians must be responsible in accordance with the law that aircraft disasters in Indonesia will not be repeated.
Mr. Tahjon said that a large quantity of slow deficiencies and the fact that the deterioration is too small in the territory shows that other people are actually driving into the water with a very higher speed.
"The flight was the only one when he fell into the sea.
He wasn't running air, but the air carriers, when he dropped the water, worked with great clusters -- that shows all the bully turbine minds," explained the officer.
The Lion Air's construction is a flight disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died in the nearby Medan airport of the Garuda Air.

Presidency: There is no need to facilitate the reference facilities
After approving the proposal for the Governing Board to decrease the reference card for the first section of the Constitution, the President adjusts the veto, its adviser Mindaugas Lingue says.
"The Constitution will vote more than half of the people -- this is a requirement.
This and its change, especially in its first section, should certainly be not less than the majority .
I can't be sure that the president would really have a veto," - the Radio of the Knowledge said on Thursday to the Internal Policy Adviser of the Greece.
It insists that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic elements of the state - the speech, the department, the territory, the capital, the sovereignty of the State, and therefore the amount of the number of votes necessary for these articles, as Mr Linges, would be created "neig" and "respected the uncontrolled risk".
"The President's opinion that there is no need for easier dealing, I need to set up the same reference, need more dialogue with people," he believed.
The seed plans to vote on Wednesday on the adoption of the Reference Law.
It provides for the adjustments of the first and fourteenth Section of the Constitution to be adopted if it is accepted by reference by at least two fifth parts of the citizens with the rights of the marketing.
Articles of the first and fourteenth Section of the Constitution can now change more than half of all citizens with vote right.
Lithuania has approximately 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million peers, two five hundred million.
This proposal was born after the adjustments adopted by the President's vet in September for the previous parliament, the voting requirements for the number of votes in the definition of Article 12 of the First Section of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to reduce the referendum for double citizenship, which should take place on the day 12 of the next year and on the day 26 of May, on the first and second time of the Chairman's planning of trades.
Emigrants may not be double citizens at the date of 11 March 1990, except for some exceptions.
Double citizenship aims at the world's rainhouse community, but it is afraid that the referendum would not be affected in existing conditions - not to vote enough people.
R. Masil: Lithuanian airports "braska", so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure begins to run, so it is needed to be updated, says Mr. Rock Massill.
Accordingly, the renewal of the airport of Vilnius is the minimum task to be carried out by the State.
"Aeronautical infrastructure is already strong because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew the airport of Vilnius - it is not even incompatible with a long-term planning, it is the minimum of what we have to do," Mr Masil said the Democracy Development Fund and the Country of the Conference on Wednesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important because we have to implement important projects - the end of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the outer gate of Klaipeda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kauna airports, and maybe the new airports.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to end the road integration, railway integration, stations in the outer port of Klaipeda, planning airports, may be aware of the new airport building.
We must not sleep, we have already started projects that will benefit from our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years,” said the Minister for Meeting.
Mr. Massill repeated that car travel supervisors have been assigned over a small amount in the last one year.
"The state of roads until it doesn't be better, because the funds are not enough.
We are trying to put new roads, but even the most needed care, such as in the straightways, lack of resources.
We must determine the amount of the road surveillance, if we want their status to drink," said Mr Masil.
He highlighted that exports from Lithuanian transport sector grow to 18,6% this year, and the export market became Germany, covered by Russia.
Mr. Massill again criticized the European Commission's rules that the EU's carriers will have to regularly return to the registration country.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel like home.
I think that the proposal for seekers to continue to return home is absurd because the roadways in Europe would be emptyed, burned cow, to increase the emission.
Most of this, the railway parts of the railways, because the railways will be so much that the part of the transport will be transferred to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr Masil said.
The data of the Ministry of Communication are 12.2% in the transport sector.
Lithuania’s total internal product (BDP).
It works over 118.000 employees and works over 7.500 companies.
In time with inheritance
The last week, Mr Masiulis reported in the Seimo Economy Committee on the introduced negotiations on the amendment to the cultural destination of the airport of Vilnius, which would allow an old terminal to be lost and set up a new terminal.
However, the temporary leader of the Cultural Heritage Department (CPD) calls Algimant Degutis Masiulio's discussions as a political pressure.
The building established in the sixth century in the past tenth century is a value, not political, but specialists have to deal with its elimination in 1993.
Mr. Masil commented that the modern accommodation terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania's imagination.
"I'm inherited to extract this old terminal would be a politically important step to be able to distort it and build a new modern terminal to feel in the villages in the modern country, rather than in such an interesting, really unreforming our country as innovatives," said Mr. Samey last week.
Mr. Masiulis also reported that Kaune was planning to set a completely new traveling terminal and a airport to connect to the Rail Baltica cancer, building a underground state.
This transport feed should be carried out in 2026, the end of Rail Baltica.
Pernai the airport of Vilnius was about 3.7 million people, this year expected of 4.8 million passengers, and the next year 5 million.
The cow airport covered overall 1.2 million passengers.

"This is a historical day," said B. Netanyahu to members of the Likud Parliament, the office reported it.
"This is the day when the President (Donaldui) Trump (Donaldui Tramp) introduces particularly a serious sanction to Iran, the most cruel sanction to Iran during the entire time when the efforts started to deteriorate his aggression," said the Governing Board of Israel.

The Court renewed a new motociclinical disorder environments
The death of the new motocyclinian in Vilnia, the city of North, will be heard by the judgment of the witness.
The Court of Auditors decided on Wednesday that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, the next meeting will be examined by the witnesses on 26 November.

On 22 August, the Court of Area of Vilnius on the end of the death of a motorcyclinian avarie justified the car driver, who announced 79 years of Eduard Osipov that the motocyclinian in the city was a greater speed and made a serious violation.
The Prosecutor of the Ombudsman requests the Court of Auditors to distort the Court of Agriculture and claims that the offence is due to an avariation to the E. Osipov and that the conclusions of the Court of Agency have not been returned.
The lawyer of the Motorcyclinian lawyer also requested the justificative derogation.
A'ja occurred on 11 August 2015 approximately 15 hours when E. Osipovo was driven by a car "Skoda Fabia" from the Lacun Street to the Straight Street and connected with the main road motorcycle.
The prosecutor accused the man that the car driver violated the rules for the roadway, and caused an event to run - killed the main road motorcycle of Piaggo.

When the motocycle was seen, the motorcycle driver tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before coming with "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor believes that the E. Osipova's leadership had to give a road to the motocicliner.

This evening has been established by the Lithuanian Social Democrat Working Party (LSDDP), leading to Parliament's Vice-President Gedimin Kirkilo until it is not intended to be granted funds from the budget.
However, they may be assigned to a separate VRK decision at the latest time if they change the legal environment regulating the distribution of assets to parties.
Laura Matjoshaitite, President of the VRK, informed the VG that "the Commission's meeting on Thursday is planned to adopt a decision on the budgetary half-year grant allocation partys."
According to her, the decision on this issue must be adopted by the CRK until 15 November.
For seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, it is intended to allocate 2.751 million Eur.
The Opotic Parent Union-Lithuanian Christian democracy should receive more than 0.66 million Eur, the Governing State and Green Union - approximately 0.55 million Eur, the Opotic Social Democrats Parties - about 0.5 million Eur, the opotic Liberal Union - nearly 0.4 million Eur, the Seem of the unemployed groups - about 0.23 million Eur, recently associated with the Governing Party of Training and Justice - nearly 0.22 million Eur.
In accordance with the current law, which is also the leader of the VRK, by dividing the budget money, grants are assigned to parties who are satisfied with the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes through the last Seimo, the Government Councils and the European Parliament.
This is why the current legal regulation does not allow only this year to expect the LSDDP to get money from the budget.
Because this party has no longer participated in one of them.
True, the governing coalition is trying to amend the law that social workers will receive at least a few hundred thousand euros in the nearby of the next three years - the public, the President and the European Parliament.

Samim has not yet been discussed about this veto, but the resistance of Mr. Kirkill and the leader of the Green States Ramun Karbauskis believes that the Parliaments are going to reject the President's oppositions.
However, it will be able to do until this Thursday meeting of the VRK, therefore, Mr Majoshite, "the grants will be divided in accordance with the existing legal system until now".
In fact, the VRK leader did not leave that if Seime rejected the president's vet and new adjustments this week in respect of the nomination of the budget party, the Commission could consider a decision on the adoption of additional contributions for individual political forces, and the LSDDP.
"When we take the decision, we will turn into the entire existing legal environment, because we are an entity in order to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If Seime had been able to reject vet and new laws, the Government would, according to them, have further decreased the relevant amounts.
Seven parties have already been granted by grants for such a decision.
