The American Congress agreed on the sale of Poland 32 F-35 airports
The Congress of the United States for 15 days since the Department of the State has approved the possibility of purchasing by Poland 32 multi-date holders F-35 has not expressed opposition against this transaction, which means that the last condition has been fulfilled before the initiation of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although it wasn't unexpected, has great political importance.
"After approving the sale by the State Department, and now by the Congress, you don't know any of the most important obstacles," said John V. Venable, the elder of the Defense Policy of Washington, the conservative thinking of Heritage Foundation.
Expert explained that, in accordance with the 1976 Federal Government, represented by the State Department, the Federal Government of Arms Export Control, has to make Congress with the planned sale of a frontier for 15 days before signing the agreement, if the value of such transaction, in the case of the sale of defence to the NATO country, exceeds 50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 feeders F-35 is estimated by Poland for 6.5 billion dollars. This amount is both costs of technical and logistic assistance, assistant equipment and pilot training.
The main F-35 airline supplier – if this transaction is finally finished – will be the American armed Lockheed Martin Concern, and his subconstructor is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A concern of Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of American soldiers of Fifth Generation F-35, on behalf of the Polish authorities, introduced the Defence Minister Marius Blászak in May.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of Bie year during meeting President Andréy Dudy with President Donald Trump in White House.
Over the implementation of this Agreement, if it is financed, the representatives of the Pentagon will complain in the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
In the Framework of the FMS, Poland has already bought an anti-racking Patriot system.
The price of one F-35 soldier at the presentation of Poland of a purchase offer was – without weapons and technical assistance – 89.2 million below.
As the American military experts informed the PAP, who wanted to maintain anonymity, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was “the maximum price of a lot of price that will be negotiated”.
“The prices fall violently, currently the price of one F-35 is lower than 80 million dollars, much less than Eurofighter costs, which has no F-35 loans,” said Venable.
The PAP speakers have expressed the hope that final negotiations for the purchase of the American Warf Aircraft will be ended yet in this year.
Eventual share of subcontracters in this transaction, or offset, will be discussed directly with American soldiers F-35.
What is the replacement of the Münchhausen team that is spoken in the "Payton Hobart elections" series on Netflix platform?
Guardians and parents who have been able to make sure that their healthy child is sick.
The series "Pyton Choices Hobart" takes the Netflix platform.
It refers to the history of Payton Hobart, who wants to be the president of the United States, but first must be the leader of the student authorities in his high school.

Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, it moves the subject of Münchhausen’s replacement – psychiatric diseases in those who act as if a healthy person who is occupied was affected by physical or mental disease.
There are different types of this disease, such as the Münchhausen team, which is aware of the symptoms of that disease.
Münchhausen's replacement team is a simulation that the person who remains under our care has a ability.
It is also called an invented and caused disease, and it is treated as a violence against a child.
It is rarely a spot, which, with both parents who excite symptoms or cause symptoms, would look like his child is sick.
What are the replacement symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may be different, but the NHS takes attention to the following examples of behaviour:
Convincement of the medical staff that a child looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Inhibition or detection of symptoms.
False results for the child to be considered sick, such as glucose to the potassium sample, would look like a child has a sugar.
Evolution of symptoms of disease, such as administration of drugs and other medicines to children.
How often occurs Münchhausen's replacement team?
It is difficult to consider how often this is injured because many diseases are not reported.
The study published in 2000 indicates that over two years there have been 89 of this disease on 100 000 people.
What should be done if there is a doubt that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local special service office or call for the NSPCC child protection information by selecting number 0808 800 5000.

“Thes are maintained in dehumanizing conditions for the purpose of submission or obtaining knowledge of coraine.
Many of them were close to their backs, which proves that it's a bit.
That's why we're studying the school to know her owner," he added.

Boris Johnson addressed to the Political Supervisory Authority in relation to a close relationship with Jennifer Arcuri business
The independent IOPC Political Procedure Authority will examine the possibility of initiation against the Prime Minister for Explaining whether during the execution of the public office as the officer of London has been allowed to survive the criminal crimes.
The Council of the Great London (GLA) declared that her supervisory inspector has registered the "the matter related to the procedure" of the Prime Minister in relation to complaints about the preferential treatment of Arcuri that result from their close knowledge.
“The matter related to the proceedings” can be said when information indicating the possibility of commitment of crime appears”, he said.
It doesn't mean that it has been proved anyway.
IOPC will now consider whether it is possible to test this matter.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which is complainted with the members of the Police Services in England and Wales.
It was transmitted to the police supervisory body because Johnson then made a position as the appropriate police Commissioner and criminal Commissioner.
Johnson refused, as if in relation to his close relationship with Arcuri, any misleading.
Earlier, he said that he was aligned with London's City Council and gave details about his relations with Arcuri, but he was reassured by the advice that the Council was "building on an inappropriate problem".
The order is the result of the introduction of the Sunday Times that the Arcuri, the American, which had been transferred to London seven years ago, had 126 000 pounds of budgetary money and also a privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which were the leader of Johnson.
As a result of this adoption, the Government formed the amount of 100 000 pounds for the Arcuri Company Hacker House.
The Government shall wait for difficult questions on the verification procedure carried out before the grant of the fund.
Matt Warman said in Izbie Gmin that his employees “usually kept proper care” and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to the numerous points of connection with the number, they were transferred to the office in California, where the 34-year Arcuri is now living.
The Prime Minister's relationship with the businessman was "for the secret staff of the police".
The GLA decision to address the Prime Minister's case to the independent IOPC Political Procedure Office was uncomfortable at 10 Downing Street.
According to the round of the government's representative, it is “the political motivated attack” and its term, in the preceding day of the Conservation Party, is“the political”.
“The supervisory inspector has not submitted any evidence that confirms the claims, and the Prime Minister has not allowed the opportunity to give him the answers before publishing the press communication later on Friday evening”, states the Commission.
Neither citizens nor media will be able to take such a clear political statute.
Today, in the past hours, journalists The Standard said that the close relationship of Johnson with the businessman from California, which helps the tourism and promotion agency in London, was a "secret of polisine" workers.
The workers of the London & Partners Agency (L&P) were higher set up that Arcuri had a place during the foreign trade outcome of Johnson, despite the fact that her companies were then not “trusted”.
Third accused of drug crime related to Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – In relation to the past-year death of rape Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and has been charged with drug crimes.
According to the judicial documents, Stephen Walter is concerned about the sale of oxycodon pillars, which Miller had before death in September, in the result of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, or strong opioid responsible for “epide”, which has decreased several of the human existences in the United States.
Walter is concerned about delivering the pigs that another man, Cameron Petit, sold to Miller.
The court documents repeated on Tuesday show that Petit received drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested this week in Lake Havasu City in Ar ́na, is suspicious of the role of Walter's "currier" who delivered the pigs to Petiti.
None of these men were charged directly for the destruction of Miller's death, nor had any of them represented the defence lines in his case.
Walter is in prison with a conditional release for drugs from 2005 and has already been sentenced to the freedom of freedom for the violation of the freedom conditions.
Prosecutors who are concerned about the case that the first of the website has been dedicated to the objectives of the TMZ, ask Walter to stay in prison in waiting for a process, saying that there is a significant risk for a protected refuge.
The reply to the message left on automatics has not occurred immediately by the Secretary of his lawyer.
Petition was invited in the federal court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
Miller's words of rumoured uts are a depressive conversation about his depression and use of drugs, so he gained fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who really seemed Malcolm James Myers McCormick, stayed in connection with the song Ariana Grande ended before 2018.
After his death at the Instagram port, she published an exciting film with Miller and the "Thank U Next", in which she remembered him with me.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been connected in the past years with opioids.
Matthew Roberts, a guita team of 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of the transaction in 2016, and in his body was found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodon.
This article has changed: the valid name of Walter is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year Nigerian makes more than 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a type of fun in hidden with a free software to program Scratch 2.
Scratch 2 allows operators to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
As Basil has generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
Today's game is an intope that is treated according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he catches the intoper, who's going out of the cover.
I learned game creation on a quick course.
"Now I'll create them when you're nu," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote him to a five-day accelerated course for children from 5 to 15 years.
The course organized by Codefest International was aimed at acquiring children such as Basil, access to new workers as robots and virtual reality.
The father of the boy, Basil Okpara senior, says Basil played a lot on mobile devices.
"When he was four years old, I bought him a tablet because he always got a phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy's and Temple's," CNN's father said.
But the interest of Basil by the game increased when he was 7 years old, and he set a bullet for dedicating a time for the game.
"Every day he played on the table, as well as it was, and he was so disappointed that I was sick," said the father.
I said with: "Continue playing, can't you think about playing your own games so that they can play others in them?"
When I said these words, I was nervous and I didn't think he'd take them in mind," he added.
Since that time, Basil has shown a real interest in the learning to create your own games, encouraged parents to buy a laptop and record it to the course where he knew the foundation of the game creation.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his top titles based on their contents.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population leads both to innovation in the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were not celebrated for the use of codes to create robots that distribute their work at home.
In May, the Acrobat team from the Middle School in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 concurrence for the programming robots for boxing.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in the field, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his experts are on a good way to the coding stars.

Brother sentenced for the death of the honorable stars of the Qandeel Baloch Media Reconciliation
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star through the publication of the service services, was released in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistanian Media Star Qandeel Baloch was recognized for her murder on Friday and sentenced for the most famous prison in this patriarchal country to be “the honorable murder”.
Baloch, who received glory by publishing the smile himself – Greek according to western standards, but in a strong mizoginian Pakistan, was released in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Wasema was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the pressure, that there was no consciousness of his actions and declared that he had definitely killed his sister and that her behavior was "inacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood reported AFP that the court in the west town of Multan recognized his client as a guilty and sent him to live in the expected sentence.
He said: "Inshallah (if God allows), he will be condemned by the judge of an instance."
Before the mother of Baloch, Anwar Mai, told the AFP that she had hoped her son would be deceived.
“He is innocent.
It was my boyfriend, and it's my son," she said.
The murder of Baloch has come to men of the world's information services and has renewed the call for action against the epidemic of honoral murders in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal principles.
Women were inflammated, dearly, they were spread or styled for excuses such as the choice of their own husband, or, as in Baloch, for bringing their family "sham" by manifesting their own sexuality.
Mords are usually committed by a nearly bloody.
According to the Pakistanian law Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (subject) they can be the nearest sacrifices for forgiveness.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, the Parliament adopted a new law in order to punish the prison for honoral murder.
However, whether the murder will be considered honorable crime, it remains in the guest of a judge, which means that the murderers may be theoretically calling on another reason and be disregarded.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first pressed their sons to show grace in any case.
However, the disgusting people think that they can also lose it, change their opinion, and declare that they want his union.
Both international murdered have encouraged the Pakistanian country to take an unprecedented step and to announce themselves as a cousin with parents, thus forced to move the matter to front.
One of the most famous doctrines of Baloch is to offer striptize before the Pakistan crycket and the establishment of a decorated purple bottle in Valentine.
It was criticized and threatened, but many, including young people, observed it as a brokeing limitation in the country where the invitation to stand on Kim Kardashian can be considered a mild and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The "honor" murder is located in the tribal standards that still dominate in South Asia, and in particular standards for women's behaviour, although men can also be victims.

Increasing violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina in the past 10 people are rather the result of organized armed groups.
"It's drawing an anarchie and uncertainty," he said to journalists on Friday.
He reported of frequencies of violations, tortures, forces, murder and attacks on the sexual background of attackers, which also destroy houses and stealing flocks.
The police and the police were sent to fight the crime bands in the region.
However, it has been removed from the fight with Boko Haram and the distance of the Islamic State in Western Africa, which has been removed from its former grouping in 2016.
"Refugees don't come with group names," he said.
They're coming for it with potential stories.

The new date of reporting of a man concerned about the killing of women and 2 children has been determined
The new date of the report was planned for the guatemale man concerned about killing the residents of the state of Iowa and her two children.
From the Court of Auditors of the Regional Court in Polk, the 31-year-old Marvina-Orellana is charged by three murders in the first degree under, as the authorities claim, the false name that he first delivered to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't confess his fault.
The police said that he killed the 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old boy and her five-year-old son on 16 July in their home in Des Moines.
The Court act shows that the new date of the report, which is 27 July, will give the representative more time to prepare for both sides.
Immigration and customs officers of the United States claim that Bar-Orellana lives illegally in the United States and has been deported twice before shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced for illegal entrance into the United States.
“The Sun”: Boris Johnson in the face of a building of a office that wants to decrease brexit requests and achieve a compromise agreement with Brussels
For almost three weeks before the end of the EU leadership among the most important people in the country in the area of the Prime Minister, there are fears that he does not have enough time to obtain the major provisions.
Boris Johnson stands before the risk of a bounty from the Office to reduce demands in relation to brexit and to achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations there was an emphasis on a new customs system that would constitute a replacement for Ireland backtrace mechanism, since Brussels has determined the proposals of other claims offered by Johnson as "incomplete".
The Ministers of Corone expect the EU decisions on which the leader of German Angela Merkel is to offer you a criticized toris leader compromise in the form of a three-year term of time for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists talked with three different office ministers, all of which are prepared to confront the Prime Minister for the next week in Manchester.
They will be asked by the Prime Minister for the "agressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominik Cummings on the EU's attempt to use blef and the threat to leave the Union without an agreement and the next acceptance of the proposals which the Union has recently adopted.
One of the Ministers of the Office has determined the prosecutor of the Court of Justice on Wednesday on the end of the parliament as a "sign of warning" and added: "The only way for us to leave the European Union is to do it on the basis of the agreement on 31 October.
We're never going to get the arithmetics in the Gmin Isby that works on our injury.
The Prime Minister has to go down now and accept what is able to do about it.
Agressivity doesn't pay: it's evident that Cummings' plan burned on the lady.
We can't run bits on so many fronts.
The second minister of the Office was committed to transfer Johnson to try to interrupt the agreement of the former Prime Minister Theresy May, unless everything else happens.
The Minister said: "If I have to tell the Prime Minister to present again the agreement proposed by Theresa May in Isba Gmin."
There are numerous opportunities for its vote, and all are very dependent on the end of this issue.
If we're forced to extend the term, the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John forgot Boris Johnson that he doesn't treat negotiations seriously.
“ The Prime Minister says to us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see that he sits in Brussels and works on her.
Instead, he's strengthened with beaches in Scotland, he's checking eggs in Wales and striving with citizens in the main streets of towns – everything in the eyes of the world, as if he's been a choice campaign for a good time."
The speaker of the present Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was a decline, and added: "No one should have any advantages: to conclude a very long way."
However, the rapporteur also said that the Benna law implementing a breach of three months in the case of the failure to reach the agreement "is actively weakening our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law strengthens us negotiations, but despite it, the Prime Minister and the workers are still trying to make progress."
The Secretary of Brexit Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels, where he will find more talks with Michael Barnier on the EU.
They will discuss how to join the area for all Ireland for food and food.

She was sensitive and I needed her," Kate said.

Lorraine Kelly: It was said that I would never make a chat on TV with a language accent.
According to Lorraine Kelly, the television boss said that because of Glasgow's accent, he will never make Ka’y as a representative.
Remembering her 35-year-old chain in Kelly's 59-year-old television, she admitted that before the first emergency on the screen, she felt “a big disappointment”.
"I was almost 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland in a specialist role to search and check information, the chief of the chiefs said that by my accent from Glasgow I would never have success in the television.
I went to London to know the whole TV team and look at the program before I took the office in Glasgow.
I will never forget the outcome with the Bette Davis star conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew that I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scotland TV reporter in 1984, she dealed with her chat as a local reporter in East Kibride in Scotland.
She started programmes such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to start later with her morning program "Lorrain", which took a name from her name.
35. In the year of his cata'a, he will teach a special programme, which will remind his best recorded moments and outcomes.
Pre-concerning said that the secret of her long stage in the television is "pass and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding: "You need to work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be equally interested and interesting.
When she recalls the median advice that moved her emotions, Kelly shows that "very difficult" for her was a relaxation of Dunblane.
I had no idea that many murdered or wounded children looked at our program for living from Dunblane day after a terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old Joanna was killed, asked me for a private meeting that we talked in her house for a lot of hours.
As the meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I have been friends from the time of the funeral of Joanny when I took part.
She added that "noblely difficult" was the outcome from Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their Madeleine's disappearance in 2007 and that "their power and courage are truly invoked".
They have to advise themselves with → because they don't know what happened to their loved one, and they also have the most dangerous Internet Tro comments.
I'm with them with the whole heart.
The 35th-year-old work programme Lorraine Kelly on television is delayed at 8:30 on Monday, 30 September at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of prison
The higher range of the State officer stated that vice-President Constantino Chiwenga had refused to offer the president's approval by the innocent President Robert Mugabe at the countdown point, because he was afraid of the prison to confirm the authorisation of the authority in November 2017.
As the "The Zimbabwe Indian," the last week, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwendze to take the presidentship during negotiations with a reverse framework.
However, the State officer noted in the security media that Chiwenga did not repeat the offers from fear, but because he broke the Mugabe plan, which provides it to be used to demonstrate the world leaders and the African Union (UA), that he was actually lost during the turnover.
On the basis of Twitter port, who confirmed that 37-year-old rulers of Zimbabwe wanted to submit the authority to Vice-President Chiwend, not to President Emmerson Mangangagvie, Jamwanda 2, as regards which the officers of the State confirmed that he was a national officer in the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, was said that there were intense negotiations on this matter at that time.
The officers of the State claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his sentences when he realized that the authority was dismissing him from his hand.
The mediation between the authorities and the dead former president had, by the opinion of the State officer, three steps.
The officer claimed that among the parties of negotiation was a President of George Charamba, who then played the role of the Chief of the Central Organization of Exhibition of Aaron Nheper and the representative of the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
Gideon Gono was the next element of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe since Mugabe sent him with an individual mission to submit the Chairman's Chairmanship, who was the Chiwende Defence Force Boss (SOZ).
A man who was more than life after death as an African icon tried to obtain the UA's condemnation of action, seeking to encourage other African leaders to intervention.
The Chairman's offer, from the Mmar's (Mugabe) presently to the Defence Boss (SSO) Chiwende, was not from the choice.
“It was a devastating act to save situations that had taken a dangerous fast time by making part of the family mar”, wrote the officer (Jamwanda).
But there was also a little political trial that helped the dead to reverse the situation in a completely non- diplomatic way.
Remember that the leaders have declared that they have not distorted the Constitutional Order, which would be their conflict with the UA position on the counterparts.
The dead (Mugaba) had hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would be severely disappointed by violating the statements of leaders that they did not distort the Constitutional Order.
The hope for murder (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, in the margin, was very disoriented by the whole situation and the way to join it in its theoretical taxonomia, would not have a different choice at that time, just described it as a reverse, in relation to which the call to intervention would be reliable.
Just in such a spirit, and with such calculation, this offer was made.
The officers claimed Mugabe did this move when he realized that the defence forces had no longer been ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign the rejecting letter after the warning of the forcer that he risks the linch in Kaddafi.
Boss of the Spanish told him that they would not return the shooting against the citizens, they would move them to Blue Roof's residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires to save his family and to prove that it had taken authority," added the officer.
The current SSO and the leaders read correctly.
The devastating message was given to the devastationist (Gono) through a huge metafore that the wakwapa-makwapa tour (we belong to the cuflage sect), which is not political or political competition, stated the range of the State official.
The officers say to the State that France has put the leaders in the region in the middle of the attacks, who lived in Zimbabwe, not intended to packaging Mugabe but to develop with the "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to make the same strategy to try again to return from a short exile in the South African Republic to be able to talk about reverse and success.
In addition to military negotiations, Mugabe was also seeking assistance in the region.
The residents of South Africa, which constitute a key element of the process, not only because of their economic and regional power but also because of the fact that the present President Jacob Zuma was the president of Sadc, rejected the intervention, but they indicated that if Mugabe is coming as many times as feared in the background, the South African Republic will immediately appear in Harare.
"It did not work because Putin and African leaders did not choose this path," said the Inde't a certain informator.
China needs a strong leadership or "decline" as stated by the policy document
China needs a strong, increased leader of the Communist Party, since a different country will "reduce" – stated the government in the document on the policy issued on Friday in the 70th year before the Republic.
The Chinese press office reported whitely that the successes of the country from 70 years ago by the Communists have been brought to the leadership of the party.
China is a large area, they have national conditions, but there are rarely administrative difficulties.
The document reminds that without the unified and powerful leading force of China, they will move to the side of the divisions and disasters, which will be a disaster for the world.
The Chinese authorities in the resolve of problems have long-termly applied a strong hand policy as for the pro-democracy protest translation in Peking in 1989, motivating this possibility of maintaining the stability of the country.
The President Xi Jin's strong hand, who will be on the front of the second year's trades in the world economic size, has even more stressed the governments of the party and has raised sanctions against those who can exercise authority.
Xi also monitors the modernization programme that has removed the region from the equality.
The document stated that China does not try to export their development model or does not want to import any foreign models, but only to the room, not to the "hegemonia".
Chineses have no genes of other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China was disappointed by great powers, and the deep and anxiety pressed on them with deep pressure on the effect of suffering; the Chinese will never suffer any other suffering they have experienced.
China trades this year in uncertain times for the country in bitter trade with the United States and faces challenges because of the economy and anti-government protests under Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "translates" its most important interests or does not allow something to harm their sovereignty.
In the case of the trade agreement with Washington, the document stated that “the trade dangers and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to the solution of problems”.
China is an economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial layer, a wide place on the market and a strong economic development.
The document added that “the warfare will never be weak to her”.
China is that they are able to put up the difficulties, the crisis to replace in new occasions and open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should rationally look at China's development because China does not intend to replace the United States' positions or would not want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and still less likely they keep China's development.
Limitation and weakness of other countries and transmission of national failures out of the border to the United States of a strong position.
The world of Jack Palkewicz: Dubai, true face
Dubai's emirat is a place that seeks his own identity, divided between bethuanian tradition, islamic radicalism and extremism of progressivity.
This designing new trends of the world tourist leader of the world is awakening the imagination and desires, enhancing the freedom of snobistic hotels and attaching the fortunes of investors and traders with the status of the tax paradise.
The Internet sites are enthusiasm to this city of marchs, which is an exciting temple of luxus and a constant concentration of XXI age.
They arose on the rich in a number of sands of emirates became Eden for those who love the rest, the five star hotels, the beautiful gate and the base for hundreds of meters over the earth.
Many people are increasing in this world with a disturbance, a creative hyperactivism and a histerical trace of adventure.
Here's the city whose motto says everything: "Stop, worry, and worry."
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, guarding them in a city without character.
According to the British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the metropolis' full availability and opposition has taken the size of the tendet magic”.
Prox was in a future cosmar, completely designed by the "Kee'a Guiness Records", an unofficial emirate horse.
Because everything here must be greater and niceer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is something missing in the guest of excess and extent residue that may be a little longer in ancient Europe, but important for the quality of life.
In Vroclav, Berlin or Madryt, everyone feels like in his own house.
And I'm sure not in Dubai.
When I fled from the world of the wind, I cut off his golden mask, opening the second face of the Artic Paradise.
He's going to figure what it doesn't speak and not write about.
I'm showing the Asians who are contrary to the basic conditions of the divine ethnic castle of Dubai, the unscriptible Beduin uncles.
I'm going to be in the place of a mistaken murder, for example, to getta at the circle of the city, where the army of Asian workers is in cruel conditions.
That's what they built in a single generation in slavical conditions that follow the wilderness of Manhattan.
They arrived here with the debtors and the possibility of worth life to their families, and they remained cosmar.
This tourist will never see it, because it could be putting it in a poe that was created for the years of Mit Dubai.
The more frequent criticism of international coherence makes the more difficult for emira's work force.

"I was sick and it was probably a few years."

Gold on two rounds: Poland Rower for a million gold
Covered with gold, a million golden rower could be viewed on Jubileus, 10th edge on the International Rower Rower Coals BIKE-EXPO.
It's a nice 3D-printer.
His 30-year-old Adam Zdanovicz just for him was the Oskar Rower at the World Customs Rower Exposition in Las Vegas.
- The rower is covered by the golden natrium chrome, and there is the best silver test under it.
It's an untypical trailer made by my friend from Jor.
"It's a bottle, it's a pedal, it's a driver, it's normal to drive it.
It can develop 50 km/h.
It's a electrical rower," he's exactly his owner.
“The rower carosure has been printed on the 3D printer.
It's a sixth type of virus.
I got the idea of this model eating on my first round home a few years ago.
I've drawn it on the card and hided the deep inside the shuflade.
He's been waiting for years.
The rower himself was three years," adds Adam Zdanovič.
“It was extremely difficult to hide all elements under the carosure.
In the middle there are batteries, carriers, elements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's hidden under the caroser in 11 elements on the table frame of the round.
The engine is hidden there too.
The leader to this road was a week before I was released to the United States to the World Rower Exhibition.
Finally, I couldn't find out what the driver was to be.

Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist places
The Sydney covered by the building of Opery, Quay Circular, Luna Park's entertainment park, and mostly the Harbour Bri's pool contributes to 21,9 billion dollars, annually inputed in the Australian economy by visiting tours in Sydney.
Yet, under the pool, it's fairly true.
The known Sydney floor is one of the most contaminated water roads in the country that affects the quantity of pollution is equal to 15 Olympics basens each year.
These continuing statistics make one of our biggest tourist actors at the same time is one of our most cruel accents.
According to the new film material entitled “Zatoka Sydney – up and down”, waters in the surrounding area of the city are filled with flashes, plastic chains and bottles, lost bottles and parts of clothing and even dead animals, and all of this flows to the floor together with the rainways.
However, the largest component of our ship channels is plastic.
"I'll call this paradox," says in September 27, the video of Dr. Katherine Dafforn, the director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, which is being published throughout the World Day of Turism.
This Aven looks beautiful, but it's one of the most changed and corrupt to escape the river through our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that each hour 1560 kg of plastic is assigned to our water roads, and its majority affects the wheat by driving channel.
"After such a tragic floor... it looks very tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of pollution originate from rain trees.
However, as in the ice mountain, the problem with Sydney is significantly more significant under the water covering, since 70% of the plastic that remains in the ocean is traveling to the bottom of the sea.
"I mean, as long as it doesn't take time under water, you can't really get up what is in the deep," said Richard Nicholls, the owner of Dive Centre Manly, by noting that he and his team are self-extracting from water 500 kg of plastic per year.
I think if more people knew (what is under the water), they would be just over.
It's pretty... over the half of what we find on the bottom, it's plastic networks.
The rest of 50% are things that are at least done from art creature.
When you look at the bathroom, it looks beautiful, and people can't stop that all of this plastic and the rest of the wastes we're getting out of the cover.
Jeremy Brown, co-operator and director of the Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways in which people — equal to the place and tourists — could help for the amount of plastic and the rest of our water roads.
"It must start at," he said.
We need to set up the amount of plastic used by us, better × material recycling, and we have a greater degree of what we're leaving in the streets that finally get to the oceans.
It's destroying the ocean, waiting for us to be destroyed, because 50% of the ocean inhaled by us comes from the ocean.
He's cutting 30% of carbon dioxide and our food.
Yet, we can arrange this bathroom and restore it to an ancient celebration, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves too.
The film material, financed by the TOMRA recycling company in its series of efforts aimed at educational environmental and negative impact on drinks that are often affected in the environment, is undertaken during the test on the dependency of arts and psychological health that has been published in this month.
The new survey conducted among 546 children from 12 to 18 years has found that 82% of respondents feel unconscious to waste of plastic waste and 25% of adults were guilty of a single plastic packaging problem.
The study showed that waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste waste, and 93% of the 551 inquired parents said that they would increase their fears related to the amount of plastic waste that remains in the ocean.
Many people who participated in the study said he wanted to do something about waste of art, but they simply don't know how in significant changes that led to ecological fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Mems after the sword of networks in half-final ME
It wasn't a easy sword.
The Slovenians had a livelihood public on their side, which is effectively deconcentrowed by the half of the networks.
A lot of controllers also encouraged judges who, in one of the actions, did not have four intentions to turn on the economy.
This happened at the key moment of the first seat when Vitala Heyne's supporters had the chance of running the fish and winning the first party.
However, this did not happen, and the Polish finally had to recognize the ability of the rival that after winning 3:1 played in the final tour.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, closed a strategic partnership with Google.
It will help the Poland companies to wd and use the potential of calculating clouds.
Products of Google Cloud Platform included in the offer of the Operator of the National Cloud, and Google on the Warszawa region, etc. Google Cloud – a bond of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Middle-East European region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public calculation cloud installation in Central Europe.
It was one of the key claims that were based on the project of national clouds, initiated and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and the Polish Development Fund, participants of this company.
The National Cloud Partnership and Google is another important step on the road we have made a failure year ago, announcing the call of the Operator of the National Cloud.
The objective remains without change — the digitation of the Poland economy and the degradation of its growth.
“Now the Polish firms are gained by a raffined tool for its implementation.
As they are, they increase their opportunities to advance to the world's liaison, which depends on all of us.
It's that Google's crowd strengthens our common project," Zbigniew Jagelello, PKO president of the Poland Bank, says.

Google Cloud offers advanced, products and analytical tools based on a leading technical infrastructure, which provides the calculation power and data storage services.
Poland's clients in the portfolio services include all the key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery
To enable Google Cloud services to offer the National Cloud, the Polish before-lawers can use exactly the same advanced competitions from which they use their global competition.
But thanks to us, they will remain in Poland's jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," Michal Potocz, president of the Operator of the Cloud.
It adds that the company will be ready to megatries, such as internet things (IoT), which will increase the need for a calculating power that is necessary to translate rapid data collections.

Tasmanian devils may provide indications on the treatment of cancer
Tasmanian diabetes may have the key to treat cancer – studies have made a breakdown discovery that can revolve therapy for patients
The medical researchers discovered how to mask the new cells
Researchers claimed that the same process is involved in the Tasmanian devils and people.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatment methods for oncological patients
What do the Tasmanian and humans have?
New cells that can become invisible.
Students, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a cross-break discovery that can help revolve to join therapy with newspapers, do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treat mortal guys in the face-screen, which prevent the future of the threatened Tasman devil.
The test has determined how to mask the new cells are equal to humans, as well as the bottles, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes the marks that would otherwise signal the opposition system to the attack on the new world.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell cancer, neuroplastome and type of skin cancer called cancer from Merkla cells.
"The extreme importance of this project is that in patients who are sometimes resisting immunological therapy, we can be able to restore this process," said the AAP main researcher Mark Dawson from Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be addressed to the reactive inclusion of markers, MHC proteins, which allow immunological system to solve new cells.
"It is potentially a long-term influence for people with newnoty," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most frequent diseases on earth.
Or maybe we can treat her much better.
The researchers also hope that the discovery will be used to treat the gases of the Tasmanian face, where new cells will avoid discovery similarly.
"Nez" is that it is exactly the same process (in the case of newnesses in people and in the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“How hard it was to treat the guys of the Tasmanian devils until now.
But if human medicines can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists surprise the fact that around the very small star, a very large planet
Scientists are surprised after discovering a solar system of 30 light years from the Earth, which emphasizes our current understanding of the processes of creating the planet, because the great planet is similar to Jowis around the small star called Red Boast.
Artistic illustration of the gas type planet at GJ 3512b round around the central star that is a red bow, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, the stars are much greater than even the biggest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case stars and planets are little different in size.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is 12% of the size of the sun, rather than the mass of the planet around it, at least half of the weight of Jowis, or the largest planet of our sunset.
"Yes, it's absolute surprise," said astrophics Juan Carlos Morales from the Catholic Institute of Cosmic Studies at the Spanish Cosmic Studies Institute, which was on the head of the studies published in Science.
The discovery is amazing because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that the stars of low mass of regulations become stars for smaller planets like Earth or less Neptons.
"In this case we discovered a gas type planet like Jowis' clock around a very small star," added Morales.
This planet, like Jowisz, is mainly consistent of gas, is discovered using the telescope in Calar Alto in Spain.
She surrounds her star after a very ellipsic orbit, and the full circulation is 204 days.
Red wheels have and have a relatively low temperature of the wheel.
GJ 3512 star is not only significantly less than the sun, but at a degree it is comparable to the size of a very large planet because it is only about 35% greater than Jowis.
Emittent less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their reverse temperature is rather low and is nearer than 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"This is why they have red color," said Morales.
"There are evidence of the existence of the second planet of the clock currently around this star, while the third planet could be removed from the star schedule, which could implie the elliptic orbit of the planet like Jowis," said Morales.
The planets are from the same inter-star disk of gas and dust that produces a star around which the planets round.
In accordance with the leading model of the planet called acreation model, the original object is from the parts of constant in the disc, and the gravitation force of the planet at the early stage of development allows the atmosphere of the gas-containing atmosphere.
This untypical system can explain the competition model called the model of gravitation instability.
"In this case the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a disturbance of disk stability and thus can appear more flat areas.
These masses can grow up to the moment of falling down and on the planet.
Delicates workshops protected for the administration of the fasol dip containing metamphetamine

What does KAS do about Boss N'?
Increasingly paying for the amount below the market price is the preservation that occurs in relation to the case of President of the Marian Banasia Control Affairs.
What the carrier does in this matter, we asked at the Krakowa Shop and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in the reporting for "Superviser" TVN presented doubts on the property president's statements of the Marian Banasia Control Exhibition.
Since a few of the tests, the Central Anti-Coruption Office has been tested.
The control has to be completed in the second half of October, already after Parliamentary elections.
As a result of the statements, Banash had to pay a stone of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
He received 65,7 thousand gold for a year.
The Supervisor report showed that the hotel was located for a hour in the stone of the stone.
Boss N's later at the national television, why he only received a little more than five of the golden pillars in the middle.
"Gazeta Electoral", calling for experts from the appreciation of the innermost, it estimated that this should be 15 of the golden ones behind the steel.
"The quota was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary agreement and just that the renter had to buy this stone, it felt that I agreed to the lower factor that I remained the duties counted on the sale of the stone," Banas convinced.
However, there were doubts whether such action is no violation of law.
Conrad Zawada, the press officer of the Scarb Equipment in Krakowa, in TVN24, informed that “the case is directly for the Ministry of Finance”.
"Every of this kind of question, please direct to the Minister for Finance," he added.
Invada said that in such areas, “the National Carbova is conducting action”.
The press officer of the Ministry of Finance, Paul Jurek, admitted that the Statewawawawawaw is monitoring a lot of matters that can wake up some precautions.
“Scarbowa's carrier works in such a way that it has its own information and is in a certain sense based on the information that is publicly available.
On the basis of this, it is decided whether any specific matter of eventual procedures or not,” MF advocate.
"Instead, because we all are eligible in the whole resort of the secretary of the cargo funds, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a specific taxor, a particular person or a specific company," he emphasized the question of Marian Banasia.
The Ministry of Finance Jerzy Kwietinski underlined that “cash offices are not transmitted to public information of this type of message”.
"We know that the whole carb machine is very similar in the whole country," he pointed out.
The secrets of the king’s family: Reveled surprising guests often flying on the king’s plane
In the field of service members of the king’s family during their life, hundreds of travel throughout the world have to go.
This usually easiers the king’s plane — a private machine that carries the king's family throughout the world to important events and events.
It's not surprising that having your own plane is related to the privileges.
The king's families do not have to stand in long rows to repair, they do not apply their limits to the number of baggage, and, as it is shown, they can invite any guests — including really unconcerned.
According to one who has an unexpected premium on Channel 5 documentary film, not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel with the king's plane.
During the program entitled “The King's Secrets of Flights”, the Queen's flight navigator showed that together with the king's family often footballed guests.
Bob Shields said, "As times with our very important kingly guests could fly very important King dogs."
It is not surprised that the queen could have been able to make her loving friends associate with her travels, because she is known of her deep association with the dogs of the corga race.
Since the youngest years, the Queen of Elizabeth was the loving - kindness of these fourth-countries and heard that she was the owner of more than 30 corgs since the coronation.
It is said that in 2007 she had corgi: Monty, Emma, Lineta, Willova and Holly.
D'other's cocker sleepers: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs who are a crosscreen of corgs: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The king's plane was sure he had full hands of work.
A king's houseworker who drives dogs and asks them to satisfy their needs before they are prohibited to the aircraft, says Shields continues.
I'm glad to tell you that it never happened to any incident.
The program also shows a shocking number of baggage, which the Queen takes with herself on the road in the field of service.
The film historian said: “In 1953, the Queen took a bathroom of 12 tonnes in its travel of 70,000 km.”
So that I can better show it, it's less than two big slows.
However, the Queen is not the only person who has weakness to mode.
Similarly, Cambria has its own pleasure on the transport of her guardroba – it is said that a personal seat is intended to be used for a cup of her sockets.
The new law enters into force.
Injury in cases of interest
On Wednesday, the regulatory regulation shall enter into force which is very damaged in cases of further rental payment – informs the Financial Dictionary.
It is law of 9 July 2019 on the rights of persons injured in the case of deterioration of the guarantee sum fixed under the provisions applicable before 1 July 2006.
It applies to persons who were damaged before 1 July 2006.
In that case, the insurers have already prohibited rental payments.
"I am pleased with this regulation because we have been invoked for many years on the creation of a mechanism that has allowed the real damage in cases of financial support from the communications OS or OC of a farmer despite the deterioration of the guarantee sum," says Aleksander Daszewski, legal adviser in the Financial Office.
The Financial Dictionary considers that it was necessary because it is often very tragic situations in relation to people in a very bad health status, which, for example, cannot work because of accidents, and they have significant costs for recovery.
Some of them have no longer received balanced rents and increased needs, taking into account the possibility of further treatment or rehabilitation as a result of the exhaustion of guarantee sums in the OC police.
It's been part of this in the nearest years.
By 1 March 2006, the responsibility of the insurer was significantly lower than the present.
That is why the problem of the deterioration of the guarantee sum in the past years was most often affected by people who have suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantee sums were then very low, and the economic observations significantly increased prices.
"We also realized that this problem has also affected a number of young people who have suffered damage during the period when the amount was 350 thousand euros for each damage in the case.
It is currently 5,21 million euros per view, regardless of the number of damaged ones.
So this is a huge difference in the past periods, the problem requires intervention of law," Aleksander Daszewski reminds.
It explains that because the guarantee amount is at any time undertaken, the law adopted that the higher level of responsibility of the guarantee fund will be the guarantee sum applicable at the time of addressing to the Fund for payment.
This principle shall apply to them; the insurance firm shall not be obligation to pay the interest on the basis of a sentence establishing an amount of guarantee other than the set out in the EC insurance agreement.
This shall take place in the case of submission of a sum of guarantees on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which enables the existing obligations to change.
“In the last days, we sent letters to people who in the past returned to us with a request for intervention.
We are informed of new rights in them and we are able to provide further support for any problems," Aleksander Daszewski says.

We've got a scatepark visualization!
Are young people finally expected?
The older people are disturbed by young people who are driving on the drivings and the rocks, and they are complained that there is no appropriate place for them in Olawa.
Young people have been demanding a place to carry on rolls, scarlets, scarlets, rowers.
The theme turns back to our breasts.
We've been taking attention to this problem since 10 years.
Recently, there's been a voice about no scatepark.
That's why we're returning to this again and asking what's going on in the office?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who disturbs young people, has responded to the center.
"I'm writing on behalf of the people of the block at Pilsudski, in order to be interested in the situation of the Olive Youth," says Malgorzat's editing.
“The residents of the Block have been able to call the City Watch without effect.
To prove such daily situations in connection, I have sent a party."
We asked others about this.
The majority claims that youths simply do not have where to go in town and years have been asked for places for themselves.
Under the Facebook post, the comments appeared at the same time.
In July, we wrote that there's a chance to build a scatepark on the Olaw City.
Burmester informed that the city had been financed for the building of a scatepark.
“The project consulted with the youth is ready.

We'll put it down here before.
Young people have informed that on the next Sunday (September 28th) they will collect signatures under petition for the building of the scatepark in Olavia.
"The bounting youth has seen the last post on Facebook, and they have come to the conclusion that they are organizing the collection," he writes in the editing of Michael.
The signatures under the petition will be collected since 12.00 in the Lidl market.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: Losing 1/16 final.
We know a couple, hit a year ago
It was one of the most interesting rivalisations in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has made the 1996/1997-session-sec.
On 18 June 1997, Legia adopted an old stadium on the Latvian ship in the previous order.
Both teams divided the point.
Masters had to win, the second of the row of the Polish mastership gave a point.
By 87 minutes, Legia led 2:0, but in the next few minutes, it came to the land - the vision shot three nails and rejoiced in the title.
The boat club with the course of years falls in more than a higher terapath until he stopped counting in the fight of the mastership and falling from the most spectacular game class.
The last time the two groups met at this level at the 2013/2014 season.
The law – on the road to the title – took two victories – 5:1 at her own and 1:0 on the exit.
Return to Elity
Now the ships fight back to the national elite.
These plans were late at least a year, since in the previous games they were one of the fa'its, they couldn't be able to advance the extraclass areas.
In relation to this failure in the summer, the Club has come to the Club Revolution.
The authorities have been changed, finally placed on the trainer Marcina Kačmark, and in making another step up the club hierarchie, they need to help those who are stuck in the Marcin Robak and Mateusz of the Mothers.
In the case of the vision is the fourth in Table II of the Lia, but in the Poland Pucher, he won the Vicelider Extreme Class of Sleep Wrocław 2:0 on Tuesday.
The legend in the same places was able to go out to the Department of Nepalmish.

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “wake up” and an impeachment investigation must touch his tower
It's never done where we're going to die.
Now I think we will participate in the attempt to hide the facts of hiding facts, and the investigation in this matter may be sustainable," Pelosi stated in the CNN export on the East Chapter.
"They are doing the work they've started by treating the facts and the time they need to find," added she.
From the protocol issued by the White House this week, Trump asked the President of Ukraine Wolodymyr Green to conduct an investigation on the former vice-President Joe Biden, candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Greenen to take this matter with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giulianim, as it comes from the protocol.
Trump refused to do anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN concluded that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had been reported by the claim signal of the Trump's proceedings with Ukraine within a week before the formal report.
Following the complaint as a statement by the officials of the Intelligence of the Community, the Department of Justice concluded that the phone talk of Trump was not a criminal investigation on the financing of the campaign.
She asked whether Barr should be witnessed, Pelosi said that on Friday, the Intelligence Committee decided who to call for a witness.
However, she added that Barr’s opinion “his rebelled”.
That's a long time.
"Therefore (Barra) refers to all of this," Pelosi added to the opinion of the Trup on its general prosecutor during the July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It's interesting that he has made decisions on the way to consider the complaint.
Pelosi noticed that "very feared" of the signalists Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that it was otherwise conducted with spices.
I think the President's words are beyond the inresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalists play an important role in discovering - sending expenditure in our government, "Pelosi, adding the Chairman's Word on people who can provide information that you have signed, really emphasizes the integrity of the government."
On Wednesday, Pelosi took a historical step to announce a formal follow-up on acting incompatible with the law based on the trial of pressure on the foreign leader in order to gain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in the compound published in the quarter of the complaint, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had used his authority to "invoke Ukraine in ingerency" during the coming elections of 2020.
The signalist also claimed that the lawyers of Bia’s house had told the officers to register a conversation from the computer system in which they are kept for the needs of the Ministerial Council officers and to place it in a system intended to be sensitively sensitive to information.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned with the structure of the Verification Committee
Kofi Manu, the football manager and representative of the Secondi Hasaacas Club, reported doubts on the composite of the Verification Commission for the needs of coming elections to the National Football Life in Ghana (GFA).
He emphasized the inclusion of the Commission Court, Frank Davis, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In the DNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts whether the Commission president will show honesty because the result of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons outside which do not show relations with any members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies employed the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for 10 per cent payment.
He is also a known player of Olimpi.
From these two consequences, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Committee because he is interested in it," he said.
Manu stated that it was before the Commission, Fred Pappoe, Director of the Games of Olimpi, will occur in conflict with the interests of the president because of its relations with the club, suggesting at the same time that if the Commission stands in Palmer, it will be the subject of preliminary and sidelife before the Commission.
In accordance with the expectations of the Commission, the Commission members should have been working since yesterday, after the consent in the GFA Secretariat of Akre on Tuesday, 19 September, and to finish it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and its members of the Corporational Board Consultant and lawyer Ms. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah.
The rest of the members are Reginald Larye, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavia, sports and lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
Two main parts of Israel, the Blue-Blue and Likud Soio, continued negotiations on the call of the government of units on the fifth.
The meeting of the president of the Government of Benjamin Netanjah, which had been confidenced, did not result.
In discussions, the possibility of rotation of both parties in the government and residue of Netanjahu at the premium was considered, but, as the Israelian journal “Harec” says, there was no approach to views.
Chat renewed on Sunday.
The Centre of Blue-White Society informed in the communication that he presented the preliminary posts.
The Likud's legal defense is that he “speaked in his positions” asking his leader and present Prime Minister, Netanjahu, to remain at the head of the Government, and in the form of a office, which is already in its ultra-ortodoxian policy.
"From the beginning, it was a matter that the Blue-Byale would not comply with these conditions," the votes published by them.
For a number, acting only in the interest of Netanjah, wants “to Israel to the second round of elections”.
The white-white Benny Gantz leader rejects the support of the government that would lead to Netanjahu until they are concerned about participating in three corruptional matters, based on which the prosecution could formally defend him after the meeting.
“The people and the Blue-Byale have received a sufficient majority in elections 17 September that would allow them to be common governments as natural associates, but it forces them to negotiate which no of the parties had wanted,” wrote the EFTA.
President Reuwen Riwlin tried to draw close to their position in the last days and invited the call of the “Rotational Government”, suggesting that the Prime Minister would suspend its positions temporarily, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the complaints against Netanjahu were supported and formalized.
There are no Israelites who believe that the cases have fallen in the blind cow.
However, half of the Israelites, as a result of the survey published by the public television on Friday, wishes to dislock political situations in the country by calling on the government of units under rotation by the leadership in the change of Netanjahu and Gantza.
This solution is 50.6% of the Israelites, and 32.1% of those concerned are opposed to such a solution.
The survey shows the deep share in Israel’s relief – on the question who should be the first to stand on the head of the office, 41.8% of the respondents are addressed for Netanjahu and 40% for Gantz.
In another survey published by the journal Israel Hajom, the percentage of unit governments increases to 63 per cent, 60 per cent is opposed to the new elections that would be third in that year.
In the pre-term parliamentary elections, on 17 September, Gantza's Union won 33 mandates in the 120-local Princess, the Netanjahu's group broke 32 mandates.
Netanjahu with its traditional and potential associates may be supported by 55 members while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties collected 61 mandates possible to gain majority.
Typuric calls for fighting before final game with players
Justin Typuric says that "this time for checking", when Walia stands in the face of the rest of the games with the Pucharo World, which can form their lots in a tournament.
The victory of Wales over the “cangures” would set this circuit on the position of the fa'it to the winning Group D and guarantee its participation in a probably trainfinal meeting with France or Argentina.
However, it's low Walia once 14 in the last 15 meetings, Typuric and his district are flatly sent at the beginning with England in the eighth final.
"Let's put the case, both of the circuits want to try to go through this and be on the head of the groups," said the Walish phoner Typuric.
In the past, a little difficult results occurred, but last evening was nice to win (Australia).
I think they'll try to take this victory to us, and we're able to take it again.
Before we came here, you knew that it would be a big old man.
And now we're here and it's really time to check.
Walia had only one victory over the New Zealand or the RPA in the history of Pucharo Sweet – and it had been 32 years ago in the shot on the third place when they won “cangurs”.
And their total record under the lead of the main trainer Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 trials to overcome three seats of heavy weight from southern half-south.
Walia represented a series of thirteen missing test shoes with hands in the listopade of the year, and Typeuric prepared to be among these few saved from this winning 9-6, which would run to the stadium in Tokio on Sunday.
Typuric, who asked whether the circuit had experienced psychiatric blocks before this victory, added: “It is hard to say.
These swords are so equipped that... maybe people hope that there will be a psychic block, I don't know.
The end of the ends in the last match we probably put on the boys of 15 points, so the final result seems to be much less preference than it was actually.
It's Walia's triumphing, then the fight of Tipurica with the loved Australian duo from the third line of Michael Hooper and David Pocock's mood will have a key importance during the arrest and relaxation.
Typuric played 67 meetings in representation colours and met both leaders at a few previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he expects.
"It's a soldier playing at the seventh absolute world class," he said.
When you play against the world class leaders of the third line of the moon, you always have a difficult sword to play.
These two are still with the best leaders in the world.
You know what game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is more attacking seventh and probably feels better rugby, because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best leaders in the world and put up challenges than to meat with the third line of the moon that is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and winning with these two, you must certainly be in a fair form.
I wouldn't say that on Sunday it's almost going to finish the puzzle, but it's an important sword for us in this World Pucher.
Impet is his important element.
When we make a power and continue to make great effort, we will fly like on the wings, and it will be hard to overcome us.

“Total panica” when the White House fights with finding arguments on impeachment
The officers of Bia’s House are shameful, thinking about how to refresh the pressure on impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers with the situation describes the feeling of the "total panic" sensible last week because there is no response plan to the new reality.
It seems that it is “no, uncertainty and fear” – one of the people associated with the White House describes in this way the west wheel — that the injury of the informator can really damage the president and the persons from his surrounding.
The person said, "There is no great sure nothing is hiding there."
Bia’s officers were still uncertain in what way to do, not only because there is no action plan in such a situation, but also because they are so important that the standard methods for the effective avoidance of the controller used by the president may not work. "It doesn't look like something that goes out together with the next heading cycle," the person worryed.
Another person who knows the course of discussion described the atmosphere dominant in the White House as a "shock state", who is associated with an increased unbelievingness that, together with an impeachment investigation, the President will be more likely to respond inappropriately and to become "easy to watch".
This fear is divided by another speaker who claims that the president's surrounding persons will predict that he will show more "proportional" behaviour and the pressure on him will certainly begin to grow with each day of the investigation on impeachment.
This causes anxiety that Trump can present more unpredictable behaviour and explode in an unexpected way – it is, in the context of the election year, fears compared to the view of the president and the elections.
By putting the greatest risk in the presidency, Trump moved from the attack to defence, again following the strategy that he assessed as effective during the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to acquire his own request to the Ukrainian President for aid in carrying out his political rivals in order to turn attention and address it to democracy and democratic candidate Jo Biden's activities and to discredit the informator as a leader of partial incentives.
But while many people in the White House were in the fight after Mueller's follow-up, something changed this time, advisers and advisers claimed.
The president, who is a sign of distressing force, shows that the median press show as a deceived, declared one of the persons who have been involved in the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian follow-up, it seemed not to have an opportunity to answer the questions about Ukraine – they had been told.
Some of the Presidents believe that it can be avoided damage, and part of them is the fact that the informator did not know from the first hand about the counterparty talk mentioned after the President Trump and the Ukrainian President's Green Wolodymyr – which, according to them, undermines his confidence.
And how often it is when the president is an object of attacks, this fact is lifely lifted up by his main guardians in his defence.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House indicates that the outcome of the chairman's support survey is neboticly high, and impeachment will not affect too much the obtaining of new symptoms.
“There is no positive to concentrate on the President's impeachment in the next four months”, especially if it strengthens its legislative programme and leads to a new message heading cycle.
Another speaker claims that those who maintained empeachment will help the president did not finally understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Anxious Bia’s officers seeked help in advisers, completing the team of reaction to impeachment.
According to the person who knows about plans, since these efforts are in the early phase, it remains unexpected, whether any initiative in the centre of control will be taken and what form it can take.
This person has declared that it is convinced that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a leader who is in the state of an attack in the field of the PR response to the publication of an enormous signal report and aimed at enhancing the decision of democracy action on the impeachment given by the opening of this report.
The speaker with the situation states that the lack of term vision of the strategy was visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of the Board Steve Mnuchin claimed that they were not intended to open the notes that describe Trumpa's talk with the Ukrainian President, and the following 48 hours later was possible to feel that there was no output and that the document needed to be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than during Robert Mueller's follow-up, who has actually kept silence and talked only about the middle of inquiries. One of those who can be involved in the development of the answers to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the brun robot of Trump and was a choice staff, declared the person related to the matter.
However, Lewandovski said in the NBC News conversation that it wasn't the true suggestion that he would guide this action.
"In the past years, I did everything I could to support the President and his program," he said, "but I did not participate in any conversation with the President or his team on access to the team in order to deal with false stories about impeachment."
Private lawyer Donalda Trump from Mueller, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in the activity of impeachment.
“We react to matters as appropriate” – Sekulow answered when he was asked by NBC News for a comment.
Today, the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the area of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised Biel House at the end of Mueller's follow-up, left, and the current adviser, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The speaker with the Bia's strategy said that general officers had not planned at any time to engage people or to create a leading center, but admitted that the need for coordinated, common reactions and the potential political fight was needed.
Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean passed the remont for 89 million pounds
Explorer of the Seas, along with the Royal Caribbean International family, takes this year to travel, presenting a completely new view.
After the renewal of the impressionant $110 million (89 million pounds), the ship takes a wide range of culinary smileys from the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This year Explorer will be held at the most expensive ports of Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel a smile in the Mediterranean Europe.
When the ship arrives at the end of the ship, the shipship is promised unforgetted in the sea.
By providing an award to each, Explorer after the renewal of $110 million, or $89 million, moved to a passenger ship with a perfect entertainment for the whole family.
The impressing means that passengers can surf on the board by advanced surfing simulators or see the favorite family movie, using valuables, in the plenary cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addment of virtual balconies that allow the cabin passengers to call out seeing on the ocean without the need of board.
Water lovers are designed for a new board on the base of the Caribbean curorte with the water park.
Basen records beaches and ideal stakeholders for the sun, and two modernised severely are in the hand of those who are exposed to powerful impressions on the board.
A traveller for passengers each age impones the number of activity for guests during the journey to target places.
The thought of the little Adventure Ocean for children is a chance for young family members to be beautiful reminders, and the exclusive place for free time for adolescents offers super games and music areas prepared with the thinking of persons of 12 years of life.
If this is not enough, the whole family can meet in the "B study" of the ship in the laser tag playing with the effect of lighting in the darkness, which in a impressive way can also serve as a ice to carry on the lions.
During the traveling to the Mediterranean Sea, they will also have the opportunity to know exotic smaks from the world, entering the restaurants on the board.
The modern Asian kitchen is offered on a ship in the Isumi restaurant, and in the freshly open Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is a high-inspired food inspired by innovative connection to a traditional Italian kitchen.
To the rest of the gastronomy points on the board, the American restaurant is found by the Chops Grille stakes, the latin bar Boleros, Schooner Bar and the Johnny Rockets bar.
Rejs, with the option of seven or nine-day road, runs out of Rim in May 2020.
As the second, the ship is set to the Royal Caribbean line to Allure of the Seas, which also did not pass a unbelievable repair.
After the 58-day Allure metamorphosis, in the amount of a huge amount of $165 million, the travel operator offered the guests who earlier performed the reservation, a vocker of $300 to deliver on the board.
The travel operator said: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship, which will pass through transformation in the modernization of the Royal Amplified float."
A programme that requires investment more than 1 billion dollars, which includes 10 ships and which takes four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and brings a wide range of opportunities: from unrepeated attacks and gastronomicals for night life.
Devin Nunes defends the Democrats that they ask for "Trump's nags"
Congressmen Devin Nunes from California is apparently not able to bring a close truth about the fact that the President Donald Trump is investigated.
In his fourth defense, the President assured the Democrats that they wanted the president's nage.
Nunes, a highly placed republican in the Commission on the Represtant Exhibition, put an invitation during a preliminary statement during the audience of the signalist complaint, as if Trump returned to Ukraine to help in the initiation of the democracy candidate to President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal as the "grotesian representation" of the left and their "medical asme" before he claimed that the Democracy wanted to see the president's injury.
"Democracy in this same committee negotiated with people who believed that they were Ukrainians to talk about Trumpa's nakyness," said Nunes.
“People can rightly ask why the Democracy are so determined to put the President in the state of defence when they have their chance for a year.
When Nunes had finished to give reprises, the political reporter HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, began to check if the Democracy really tried to discover it.
To this time he answered only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we assume that his answer is naga truth, confirming the thinking of many of his colleagues and friends.
The Portal Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' comments on the nutrition were related to “certain more favorable and uncertain information” which probably appear in Steele's acts,
It is praised, gathered by the former British Spain Christopher Steele's call collection against Trump, indicating the probability of the existence of a taste, which shows him in the night a devotion of a prostitute in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potencial biofuels studies can help to renew
In the past years, when electrical cars and Semi Tesli have planned information services, one is seeming to avoid renewable energy — aircraft.
However, Alberta's University Professor developed a way that renewable biocarbons could be educated as a flying fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert's University for agricultural education, life and environment, who started the work on this project in 2003.
It produces carbon fuel obtained from grass waste, such as fat from restaurant, fat origin and repack.
In contrast to ethanol and other biocarbons, this can be used in the production of less quality, so that it is estimated to 85% lower than in the oil fuel, and it will be used in the process of waste originating in other vegetables.
This technology has to be assigned to imitate carbons present in oil fuel.
"What we have done in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [created] carbon hydrogens, which are the same parts as the diesel fuel."
During the opening of this new possibility of use of biofuels, previously developed biofuels characterized the trend to destabilise at lower temperatures, which was a significant danger for aircrafts at large heights.
"The problem with the air fuel is a little efficiency round," Bressler said.
He's really less worth than diesel, but he has a requirement.
Bressler's Laboratorium is currently monitored by two options for the production of biofuels.
The first option is a small risk approach that requires the processing of carbon fuel and adding water.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that represent fuel stability, even in temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
Forge Hydrocarbons, a repressive company of the Alberty University, works over the coordination of the product, since airlines, as well as the Canadian and American Army, increase investment in renewable options.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and will be on them for carbon taxes," he said.
They want the alternatives that will be a plan for awar.
Currently, Forge is running a piloting company near the Centre of Resists in Edmonton and has last spent 4 million dollars from Lockheed Martin in the investment framework to support 25 million dollars of the production facility that will be in Sombra in Ontario.
It is expected that the company will produce 19 million litres of biofuels annually.
Bressler also states that the reduction of carbon will be 85 per cent, but the transport and fuel production, such as, continues to reduce carbon.
“As a specialist from Âia” said Bressler –
I have the task of developing options that enable knowledge of decisions and many options to choose."

Let's talk to our elders about the dangers, let's tell us how the offences act.
Please be careful and not trusting those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson warns that when the British brexit is cancelled, it threatenes the ACOMISSES such as in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for s_
One of the main office ministers said yesterday evening that the country was “violently peaceful” if the original result was questioned by the result of the second referendum.
Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom from his nearest surroundings warned that the country threatened peaceful anxieties to the scale of the protests of the "Gulden Chambers" in France because of peaceful inequalities and residence in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called to "satisfy the tools" during the bursting of the political language, but stressed that it would not stop the use of the word "submission".
Despite his calling on the Minister of the Office, The Times said: “In this country there have never been protests such as the demonstrations of "gilets news" or the residence of Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – using encrypted phones that can coordinate the pickets, and a number of popular leaders to protest are enough.
The inhabitants in Los Angeles were exploded after the wedding of four white police who killed Rodney King's black tax collector in 1992.
In this year, the anti-government demonstrators in France carrying the bullets - gilet news - are empty and devastating Paris's streets.
The Minister took attention to the warning of Johnson declared in the Gmin Isbie and said that if the United Kingdom doesn't get out of the EU, "the disaster loss of confidence in our political system" will occur.
"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people vote, 66% of them will be reported to the remaining of the United Kingdom in the European Union, the remaining of ten million citizens will not be satisfied," said the Minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100 000 angry people who will write to their employee and who will not forgive.
Many don't need to go back to see a few ten thousand people in the street.
One of the main ministers of the Office added that the country was “violently relaxed” if the result of the first referendum would be questioned by the result of the second.
Johnson called to organize the general choices in which the electors would be able to resolve brexit loss.
According to the Prime Minister's advice, there is a risk of a decreasing demand in relation to brexit and reaching a compromise agreement with the EU in this place.

Government law instead of law governments.
"Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend Conja, the majority has made a series of changes in the State system, providing a threat to the protection of the rights and principles of the rules of the authority," it says in the fourth report of Helsinki the Human Rights Fund.
The report “Legal Governments instead of law governments” documents, inter alia, amendments to justice and to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Human Rights Fund (HFPC) published in the fourth report entitled “Government law instead of law governments.
The risks for human rights protection in Poland in 2015-2019."
The Fund assesses in the report that the highest return on human rights protection in Poland was recorded in 2015-2019 after 1989.
“Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to change the Congo, the majority has made a number of changes in the State system, providing a threat to the protection of law and the rules of the authority.
By adjusting the right to political objectives, the governments have been replaced by laws by laws," says HFPC experts.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the alignment of the dimensions of justice, independent inequalities (e.g. public media or the Deputy of the People's Rights) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including the freedom of meetings, women's rights, the rights of the LGBT and the rights of the right to a pleasant process).
The report also summarises a period of three years after the Poland authorities and the European Union.
“In the last four years, we had the right to use particular interests at the first time and on this scale.
This has been translated to the persistent legislation crisis, and to weakness the human rights protection system in Poland," stressed the lawyer Marcin Freeny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of Human Rights
As stated in the report, the last four years are "system change periods are equal in the country" and "the protection of human rights".
In the last four years, Sejm adopted more than 20 key legal acts from the view of human rights protection.
"The changes were often adopted in a quick time, without consultation and despite the preservation of legal environment, the Legal Rights Deputy or international organizations," the lawyer Malgorzat Schuleka, co-rapporteur.
According to the report, the main trends held in the last four years are: "the weakness of independent in-dependence (including courts and prosecutions), the non-respect of binding courts and international recommandations and the weakness of human rights protection".
State institutions have not responded
The Helsinki Human Affairs Fund recognized “the situations in which the authorities did not respond or directly cured the aggression.
The funding experts found that some changes were introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on post-in-groups or groups for discrimination.
The Fund indicates that the result of the State’s activity in the field of restriction of legislation is the continuous support of the authorities with the European Union and a series of recommendations by international law entities.
"Not only weak the position of Poland as a democratic leader of the change in the Middle-East region, but also the Polish State on responsibility for the violation of the law of the European Union or of the European Convention on Human Rights," it states in the report.
Brother of the Pacific Stars of Reconciliation Media with Education for Honor killing
Experts of women's rights claim that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of continuing procedures, the release of suspicious murderers for cooking and the deterioration of cases in public opinion.
"It is so that people forget," says Farzana Bari, the defenses of women's rights and the first party in Pakistan, and adds that even a widely announced case of Baloch murder has been resolved for more than three years.
Although, according to groups fighting for women's rights, a fair data is difficult to be established, the Pacific Committee on Human Rights in 2018 stated at least 300% of honoural killings.
Many activists claim that the real number is significantly ≥ and that the network promoting crimes from honoural motives considers that Pakistan has reached one of the fifth of the 5000 honour killings committed every year in the world.
Records of Poland outside the border
However, transfers to the country are small, because many emigrants are assessed outside Poland to the stage – the Friday "Reczpospolita".
The newest Euro-Tax report shows that the average debt of Poland workers in other European countries in 2018 exceeded 8.6000 crimes, which means that they increased nearly thousand gold, or nearly 12%.
Euro-Tax “determines that the total income of debt emigrants in the Union countries reached the record value of 154,5 billion in 2018, with one seven more than a year before”, reads.
Director of the Centre of Investigation on the Migrations of the Warszaw University, Paul Kaczmarčik says that Poland is better in the international work market, where various options are available.
"The number of specialists and faxers, who are also moved from the country to the country in search of better conditions, just as international corporation workers," reports the newspaper.
Part of Euro-Tax clients works in two countries, such as Britain and Germany.
“It is in the RFN most in 2018, since 11 per cent increased the total costs of emigrants (approximately 27 billion).
However, most of the Polanders were captured by the Poland - almost 35 billion evil," we read further.
The President Euro-Tax considers that, despite the improvement of the work conditions on the Poland market, the number of rental emigrants is not small.
Because the Saxon on Western and North of Europe (for example with Norway) is often a chance for a few times more profit than in Poland.
“And this is even in the minimum rates in the country concerned, for example in Germany, EUR 9,5 to 11,7 per hour”, reports the journal.
The "Respopolita" states that the Polandians are not only due to the profits but also because they have been deprived outside the border.
Many Polands leave outside the border of ko, which also sees after small monetary transfers to the country.
These past years were the lowest years.
As the economy Tadeus Christiani recalls, a small group of people who transfer money to the country, and they are high.
"For the emigrants are drawing close to themselves," we read in the Friday "Respopolite".
Continuing monsons cause fatigue and chaos in many regions of India
The monsone season in India has already been extended almost a month, and the unexpected rainfall causes death to cause buildings to be removed and to swallow many fruits.
From the northern Indian monsun comes to the beginning of September, but the average rain falls over 37% over this month.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation will continue for several days, it will be the latest end of the monsone since the decades.
In many areas of the rainfall country, there are an improper trend – recently in the Middle and quarterly rain towns in the west of India have caused a few people to die and to destroy buildings.
It came to rent homes, people dropped through the streets in the waters on the knees, which normally happens only during the monsone apogeum.
Great rainfalls also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long-term rain in the north state Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas, there was no water, so the farmers were prepared for a probably suicide.
Too long monsun is not a milk seen by farmers.
That amount of rain is not normal about this time of the year.
"My warehouse – and now I have a capsule, a fashion, a gross, and a mood – will be burned," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer of the economy in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the delayed impact and the late end of the monsone means an increase in the price of the cebul, or an unusual ingredient of Indian food.
The cebul for which it was necessary to pay 20 of the britain (0.23 pounds) costs 80 rupies (a.k.a. British pounds) for kilograms in cities such as Delhi and Bobai.
They are also threatened with festivals and festivals.
The next big festival is the 8th October Festival of Dasar, where Hindus raise a huge bowl like a comic, representing Ravana, to sleep with an amazing wound and a bad smile from the epos “Ramayan”.
Ravany's burning symbolizes a good triumph over evil.
However, taking into account that the similar Ravany has been made from the paper, if the monsone will continue, that is Ravana's laughing last.

Doodle celebrates 21 birthdays of Google
It would be hard to imagine the world without Google.
We're looking for answers to all the questions that we're doing.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What's this?", "Where?", "How?" and "Ile?" is one of the favorite categories searched by the Polandians.
From the gigant data, we have been pleased to ask, "Where is the storm?", "Where is the storm?" and "Of the fingers have a horse?", "How can you lose the fruit muscle?", "How do you eat?".
Today the search of the business is about twenty-first birthdays.
Her owners – and in Poland up to 96% of people use "Google's Uncle" – welcome special Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google reminds his birthdays, showing a stationary computer with the monitor, mouse and keyboard, and at the bottom of the right corner the digital date was printed – as at the 90s.
Information Directory
It had to catalogue all possible information and provide them via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from a mathematical term of googol that means the number of children raised to the center.
This name should also refresh the purposes of the company to identify as the maximum number of parties from the world resources of the Internet.
In 1996, Sergey Brin and Larry Page had been formed in the framework of their study project at the Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of dependency on pages, which worked better than the methods of secreting results based on the frequency of the expression.
At the beginning of the searching, the name was BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to that result.
Page and Brin placed a company under Google Inc. 7 September 1998, and soon afterward, they broke the hot page of google.com.
What's going on, Google?
In December 1998, the PC Magazine reported that the Google search results were greater.
Then the story of the company looks almost like the babies - a bright development with each month, the promotion of other markets and the increase of the company's value.
In June 2000, the Google URL index has more than billion positions, which makes the work of Page's and Brina gain the largest search for the Internet network worldwide.
Currently the company's firm by Page's and Brina is one of the top players on the IT market.
So is there any other field to develop?
"Google's mission is a global organization of information resources that can be generally available and efficient, although we have made great progress in this area, this is a very long way for us to achieve this goal," he spoke with the Newsweeck Peter Zalewski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and brain disturbance
The new study suggests that the work with the contact with plant protection centres can be highly risked in the later years of life.
This was the case of a group of Japanese origins in Hawaii, who were studied for over 30 years.
Scientists determined that, compared to men who did not work with plant protection centres, those who had the largest contact with them were in 45% more for heart disease or disorder.
“Requirement underlines the possibility of use of personal protection equipment for contact with pesticides in the work and the importance of evidence in the media documentation of contact with such media in the work, as well as the control of standard factors increasing heart diseases”, said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatry medical at the Hawaii University of Manoa.
The repositories are based on more than 6000 men in Oahu Island who participated in the cardiac programme Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists, the results of the study may not be applied to women and other populations, because it was only men of Japan's origin.
Pesticides have long periods of deterioration, so the effects of their health effects can give them a lot of years after contacting them.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contacting plant protection.
Rodriguez reported: “The relationship between pesticides and heart diseases and pains has not been significant since 34 years of men'r Croatia. ”
It was so probably because the important factors were being related to stages, which masked possible negative relations after contacting pesticides and injury diseases in later years of life.
The researchers did not discover a significant relationship between the exposure to small to measured quantities of vegetables protection and increased risk of heart or pain disease.
Telephone chat Greenski-Trump: Birth to his three gross
The Washington Policy has a wormful week in relation to the initiation of the impeachment procedure against the American President Donald Trump
Increasing in political scandal, it is for the political debiutant of the Green situation that he would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Green-Trump affair and will she have a long-term effect for the first of them?
Almost at the start of the telephone calls, Trump told the Greenland that the United States did more for Ukraine than countries.
Despite the fact that the notes published by the White House are not full, they describe the Trump attack on the German Angela Merkel cancer because German leaders and other leaders of the countries are engaged in negotiations rather than to present specific proposals.
The controversy raised the Green answer, which declared that it agreed with Trump not to 100%, but to 1000%.
Greenski added that the French president Macron and Merkel are trying to help Ukraine in the same way.
This exchange of opinions led politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to take their voice from the middle of cohesion services.
Petro Porozzenko, who was President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the support granted by the EU was "without preredence".
In other Twitters, Poroszenko said that he was grateful for the EU support granted during the "Russian Aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, namely the Ukrainian Policy Victoria Voytsitska said: "How can we now talk to Germany and France?"
Thus, Trump mentioned assistance and asked the Greenish for a follow-up not in one, and two cases: the first of Joego Biden – Hunter – son, and the second related to interrupting the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in hackery attack on the Democrats' mail boxes during elections in 2016.
It doesn't describe this relationship, or makes it a disastrous relationship with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who give us aid," he declared after publishing a telephone record in New York during the United Nations Office.
Greenski has to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France in the nearby "four standards", which will take place in October.
Ancient inspectors have been legally committed
The Judge of the Wissuous Jeremy of his deeds.
After six years, Jerzy Wissnowski was finally excited from the calls.
The Court of Auditors in Industry, the former Chief of the Governing Boss of Commercial Quality Inspector of Role and Food Articles in the Rheshwa, with the derogation of exemption of the rights.
The Lubel prosecution for him was to be delivered to such a timely marine leader of the control term in the food manufacturing facility.
In this case, the lawful court of the offence has not been committed.
The accommodation was divided on September 12th.
“The Court has maintained the convicting sentence”, confirms Judge Malgorza Reizer, the Ombudsman of the Circuit Court in the Industrie.
This is the sentence of 14 February, issued by the Court of Justice in the Industrie.
Jerzy Wisnewski commented on Facebook at that time: “It was six years since I had been presented by the Applacial Prosecutor in Lublina for a claim to break the law in the conversations with Marshall Wojevodva Podkarpacki on 30 April 2012.
The Court claimed that I was innocent and I didn't violate the law that was applicable.
I was convinced that my phone talk to the Marshall Wojevod's Podkarpacki was in accordance with the law.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Applause Prosecution in Lublina is true and the unreverseable damage is compared to the feed producer and I will also lose the view of my person in my employees, among the employees and in local security.
The Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, unfair legal bases, which are not actually confirmed.
With the help of the CBA in Rheshaw, everything was done to eliminate me from public and foreign life.
I was immediately released from work and out of financial measures.
I left a long time to keep my husband."
Let's remember.
In the year 2009-2013, the Vissuski's leader of the trade inspector of food articles was fulfilled.
He was revoked from the position after the adjudication in Lublina in 2013.
Following his opinion, he had in the talk of telephones to deal with the current marine leader (Miroslav Karapyta was sentenced for four years of freedom) the time of control in the food-producing facility with the current submarine.
This warning, as Lublin prosecutors claimed, was supposed to see that the owner of the company knew about control and corrected the labels on those who were imperfect.
Jerzy Wissnewski had committed a derogation for overcoming the rights, so that he had been dismissed until three years of freedom.
"I feel a deceit that this case has finally ended and that the court has confirmed my innocentness.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I did not do anything from what the final confirmation is now a legal sentence that prevents me from the calls made to me," comments Jerzy Wissnowski.
White House tried to hide the entry of a conversation with Greenland
In the report provided on Thursday, the signalist said that President Donald Trump, talking with the President of Ukraine, the Green Woodymyre, requested an inheritance of a foreign country in the elections in the United States, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and United States
In an anonymous report dated on August 12, which is probably an expert, he said: “I was informed by many members of the US Government that the president had chosen to ask for foreign country's inheritance in choices in 2020 in the United States.”
“Trump used part of the conversation (with Greenland) to carry out its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to press the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the President in the relection in 2020”, voting on the report quoted by the "The Hill" journal.
The Ukrainian leader was "intelligent" that contacts with Trump depend on whether "the will of play" in cases that the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani had to inform him more precisely.
The author admits that he was not a testimony of talk, but it underlined that he was specifically informed of its content by “a lot of BiaʹHome officers who had direct information on this issue” and their relationships covered.
“In the following days after this conversation, I learned from many American officers that the high range representatives of Bia’s House intervened in order to “invoke” all possible records on this conversation and, in particular, the literal record that was built, as it usually is done, in the Bia’s crisis room, we read further.
“A high range of Bia’s officers told me that the lawyers of Bia’s house had “invited them” to make an electronic record from the informal system where such records are stored.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually learned to store information strictly confidentially and manipulate them," said the report author.
"In my evaluation these steps testify that the officers of Bia’s House have found matters in the importance of what happened during the conversation," signaled the signal.
As commented by the AP Agency, this document will probably accelerate the procedure on the possibility of the President's impeachment and also contain valuable information on witnesses that can confirm this report.
The record of the conversation with the Green White House, after the pressures of the Congress, was available in the middle of the Congress, but not on the basis of the electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of people who were witnesses.
The contents of the report, in the edited version, appeared later by the Committee on the Exemption of Repreants.
Joshua Maguire also witnessed on Thursday, before the Committee on the Committee on the Exemption of Repreants, and explained how he treated the report of the employee.
Maguire said that the signalist did the right choice and did as he commanded the law.
He also underlined that his opinion of the discussion with the Greenland is issued by “without pre-precedense”.
The Democracy in the Executive Committee asked Maguire why he blocked the delivery of the Signalise report to the Congress; the director said that he had no right to show his content, which the confidential nature guarantees the privilege of the Executive Authority.
A part of Maguire's hearing by the Commission has been held behind the closed doors.
On Tuesday, the leader of the Nancy Pelosi was informed that in connection with the suspicion that the president had put pressure on the authorities of Ukraine to harm his potential fishing in the following presidential elections, the Repreavants' elections followed up, which could be to the Empeachment of Trump.
On the day later, she assessed that the Trump Chat with Greenland confirmed that the President of the United States had violated the election and security standards.
Optional law in the United States to prohibit use of foreign countries' aid.
The Resort of Justice, however, assessed that the president did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, the archaeman Bia _BAR_ Stephanie Grisham said that there was "nothing in the conversation", and in the report, "nothing is more than a collection of relations from the third hand and along the pressing points."
"The White House will still criticize this story of media and a false story propagated by the media of the main note," added.
Ghana gets two ICAO rewards
Ghana received two prestigious rewards during the 40th meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The recompense in the field of security was granted in the evidence that Ghana gained the number of points in Africa on aircraft safety, which is 89.89 per cent in the provisional period of implementation (EI).
This occurred when the ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the General United Nations Aviation Safety Surveillance Programme.

The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumywa Benard Aliu, underlined the need to maintain security in the airspace by the Member States.
He stated, “the important thing is to remind us that even in the time of the innovation, the aircraft security and the balanced development must remain our fundamental priorities.”
From his side, Mr Adda said that the recompense was a huge achievement for the national efforts because they constitute a complaint for hard work and endurance.
He also added that the aircraft has a huge potential for the development of the country's economy, saying: “The aircraft has a cruel possibility to change our life.
These are the benefits of economic and economic, but everything results from security and protection that we have been able to achieve."

Trump named Peter Gaynor on the FEMA Boss: White House
Peter Gaynor, who fulfils the Administrator of the Federal Crises Management Agency (FEMA), laughs when he witnesses at the session of the Senat Subcommittee on the National Security Committee on the proposal for the budget of the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Country in Washington, 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Rerês) – White House announced that on Thursday, President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor to the Chief of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, a replacement of the FEMA administrator, is full of the head of the Agency who monitors the government response to disasters such as uragans or forest fires.
The Agency has worked without the administrator approved by the American Senate since March when Brock Long has released this position.
Long rejected after the United States Security Department, who is subject to the FEMA, concluded that Long was inevitably training government vehicles to travel through Washington and his house in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was rejected earlier in this month when the exact check of his pass revealed the claim that he had participated in the battle in the bar.
Gaynor's nomination was expected for this position.
In order to approve his nomination to this role, most of the Senate will be required.
The White House said that before Gaynor was replaced by the FEMA administrator in 2018, he worked in a crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the sea coast.

That's why I couldn't get enough to prepare for the world's mastership, and since two weeks it's so strong that I've been trying to put the rings up -- said the runer on the front of the NRK TV channel.
The father and trainer of lawyer Gert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with his son, they came to the conclusion that the only solution that he would not end the cage and participate in the future Olympics games in Tokyo will be amputation.
It seems that it's the only thing, although drastic solution and decision has already fallen.
"There is a part of this bow, it should be removed from it, and in the sum of Henrik does not so much need this finger and in this situation forget about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police closes the illegal fa's e-papers with marihuana in San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – Thursday, the police closed the illegal fade of e-papiers with marihuana in San Gabriel valley.
The office building at the street 9600 Telstar Avenue avenue faced 16:37, where the police looked for illegal sales of e-papers containing marihuana and found large stones containing botanic hashish concentrate of Indian canopy.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano, the police officers of El Monte also found a device used to supplement vampire contributions.
“This process is very dangerous”, says Cano.
Cano, who ever worked in drugs, says that the destilation of oil used in vacu products is potentially easy.
“From the electrostatic iscra of our clothes, it can result in the flame of these resources, not only by the fire, but because of the concentration, even by the explosion”, says.
“If we have a lot of glasses in the room and these similar, after one explosion there will be another, not only caused by fire, but also the explosion that could be put out of the whole complex.
A team of special tasks was called to the office to take care of illegal and potentially dangerous.
The current value of confusioned products and equipment is not known for the current time.
The detailers say that they have anonymous instructions that have allowed them to get a search order, so that it has been detected illegal activity.
The following are trying to get information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible placed interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation continues, and the officers want to be sure that illegal products have not passed on the street, taking into account the recent articles on the damage of vaccination.
"The people really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
“They may be mixed with other damaged chemicals.
This may be a threat to our confidence and children, so we always warn them before we follow this kind of thing.

Banknot 19 mal – where do you buy a collection banknote about this nominal?
The nose nominated 19 golden and seemed to him the vision of Ignaceus Jane Paderew.
At the beginning of October, a new collection banknote will be carried out – informed the National Bank Polski.
This is another banknote of the "Independence" series.
He's going to take up the 100-years of the Poland Value Paper Production.
As reported in the NBP communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
Date placed on the banknote, 25 July 2019, is the date of the 100th year of the PWPW.
The nominal value, 19, also refers to the year of production, -- we read in the NBP communication.
The water mark represents the visibility of an arrow from the first Poland banknote produced in the PWPW after recovery.
News is a holographic bar placed on the ground window.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jana Paderewski, and, besides the "decline", the view of the Order of Orla Bia has been prohibited.
This writing, reflected by Joseph Pilsudski's manuscript, is a 100-year trade logo of recovery by Poland nearby.
In a wheel chain, which symbolizes brotherhood and victory, the security made by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a shadow form of an angle effect.
On the back side of the banknote, the vision of the rocks of the Fabric on the background of the modern Warszawa panorama has been placed.
Before it is incorporated in the PWPW SPARK Live security logo and the opalising bar, also visible in the light of UV as repeated numbers "19" and "NBP" - describes NBP.
Banknot is to enter the 2 October to put up to 55 of these pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All the currencies and banknotes issued by NBP, including those of special series, are legal payment measures in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly over the one that can be achieved on the collection market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, or more than two million gold for his parents, and moved the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was conducted on a special platform to the Easton port where it was loaded on a boat.
From that way, he passed over the river 50 miles.
Jaroslav Kakinski votes for the Gosian Malgorzat

The chief of the party said that he was a person sensitive, emotional and always ready to bring help.
"I will return my voice to the Malgorate of Gosea and please the same thing," he calls.
Gosewski candidates to Seimo from the 19th (Warszawa) and from the third place in the list.
"One" is the same Kachiński, and the other place for Marius Kamiński.
The World Book Targe is coming.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break the stereotypes.
They're not reading the books.
We'll show that it's different," she said during the Mart Semi-Torak press.
And who's going to read reading in Rheshaw this year?
As we did, Anastasia's sister will appear on the towers, called the first kitchen of Richipospolite, as well as: Orbitovski Lukasz, Katarina Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jacob Ćwiek.
This seat in Millennium Hall will take place a large cultural issue – on 22 and 23 November to the trade center, the 3th edition of the World Book Targs, or one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting officers of the publishers and officials from all Poland will come to the Targe.
It's going to be up to 30, and there's some of them. Now, the sign, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they prohibit their large issuer offers and hundreds of book news that the market shareholders can buy at the attractive prices.
Moreover, during two days of the trading, special meetings with the writers will take place.
This time, the authors were invited to write about important matters and they were not afraid of taking difficult topics, and they were the laureats of prestigious rewards and... they were greatly preparing.

Exhibition of the missing bottle Elzbeth I in Hampton Court palace
None of the silver-payed bottles made of the most famous camel has been artificially exhausted by hairs representing vegetable, animals and motyls.
For Eleri Lynn, the curator of the historic Royal Palaces Foundation, it was only one thing.
The weight of the weight of 100 years on the wall of the small landscape church, which she looked at, could only be a disappeared part of Elizabeth I.
Three years after Lynn reached an exhibition of the altar wheat in Bacton in Herfordshire, the missing bowl of Elzbeth has to come to the exhibition in Hampton Court, near the same rooms in which the Queen of Tudor's Dinasty could carry it over 450 years ago.
The meaning of this discovery is that from the whole collection the king's basket was only one of the other elements of the 16th.
Although there is no unexpected evidence that Elzbeth has ever weared this cut, three years of research strengthened experts to believe that she must be part of the king's garden.
“Surebrogs”, incrediblely the road of the wheat, was legally reserved only for the main members of the king’s dead, and the virtuoser quality of the exhausted vegetables and vegetables, later rich for the cheese, dogs, motiles, fishers and wheat, indicates that the purchase was the most famous of the persons.
Suknia, when she was hidden, could cost the equality of the possession of Tudors.
“In the years 90s, or at the end of the rule of Elzbeth, she felt a danger from other women on the ground and would not tolerate the fishing weighting such weights”, said Lynn.
“As this is a very important statement, I asked a lot of people from the environment to look at the shoes.
I really felt very glad that when I saw the kitchen, they also took it up and were practically convinced that we had an element of the king's garden before us.
The long, renewable life of suckles, attached to the voice as an altar wheat in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the staff from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elzbiete lady d'a, who served the Queen through her long life and with which in local legends the tissue was embraced.
Though she died after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth must offer her to Parry family or parafia to Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than thousand hours of work Conservator, four of which was on the most delicate handful shield with a specially colored chirurgical yarn and tiny chirurgical yellows, the altar weight takes the exhibition near the time used by the Hatfield House portrait Hatfield, one of the most famous images that represent Elzbeth in a similar hole.
Libby Thompson, the Chief Conservator, whose majority of the glasses were processed in the Hampton Court Palace, is the only great place to place some of the unvaluable palace bobs in the area of Hampton Court.
"When I looked at the hair from before and back, I began to feel a great respect for those who did it.
I never worked on something like that.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth is released on October 12th in Hampton Court palace
Fi's agency confirmed the rating of Poland with a stable perspeaking
The Fi's Agency confirmed on Wednesday the Polish rating in the foreign currency at A- level – given in the communication.
Persp's rating remained stable.
“Fi’s Agency points out strong economic and well-diversified economy, which is a reasonable economic policy and a strong banking sector,” it says in the Financial Ministry's communication.
As added, Fi noted that Poland was located in a conjunctural cycle, and in the years 2019 to 2021, the real growth time of the Country Brutto product in Poland would be of 4,1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent.
The Agency predicts that the deficit of the government and authority sector to the PME will remain below the limit of 3 per cent, respectively 2,3 per cent and 1,9 per cent.
“The debt of the government and government sector to the PRC in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent according to the Agency and will be less than 48.3 per cent in the period 2020-2012,” reads.
Rating Polski
On October 11, the east round of the rating reviews of Poland will end S&P and Moody's.
Polish Rating in the Fi's agency's assessment remains the same as issued at the end of March 2019.
Then the Agency confirmed the rating of Poland at A- level with a stable perspetion.
Among the three largest rating agencies, the Poland credit credit reliability is the highest estimate of Moody's – at the level “A2”.
The Rating Polski according to Fi and S&P is “A”, one level below Moody's.
Persp's all evaluations are stable.
What's the rating?
Rating agencies are to assist investors in the risk assessment scale of their investment actions.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
In the case of these last, the assessment is translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing else than a credit credit credit assessment.
On its basis, it is decided to make a decision on the person and the amount of money to be loaned.
Sometimes such information suggests to whom it is best not to grant any credits because it is a very risk that money can't be recovered.
Lower rating is linked to risk.
The risk is high percent of the credit.
Each assessment must be justified and harmonised.
Rating can be manipulated, but in this case, the agencies risk loss of reputation.
Currently, over 90 per cent of the world rating services market are controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fi's and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own evaluation system.
‘Finth Confederation’: First 1000 plus
The ‘Federation Fifth’ means the main establishment of the electoral programme, submitted candidates to Sejma on Wednesday 40, which requested the mandate of the KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence list.
The leader of the Cossalian letter to Seyma Krishtof Chmielewski presented the password "Fief of the Confederation".
"For the first 1,000 plus for Poland, for the second fast and fair courts, for the third cultural bone and for the fourth national security, for the fifth, it is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He noted that “Poland must finally begin to work worthwhile”, therefore the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, “the problem with the free amount of tax will be solved himself”.
"Lamentation must be given a choice where they want to save their money for a emissy, or zero PIT and ZUS voluntary for all," the leader of the list on the "1000 plus programme for Poland".
Instead, Alexandra Zadencka, starting from the other place of the list, relating to the "High Life" program password, said that "feeding is even worse quality" and to change it, it should be "supported by farmers, poland farmers", to work for GMO freedoms.
As she said, the Confederation is also concerned about the suspension of “stygmatization of seed canapy”.
She supported the Confederation for "the development of the building of natural sugars".
She was also declared in behalf of her grouping for "free-free shoes".
"The law may not be broken to a consent," added she.
Other candidates from the Cossalian circuit underlined that the Confederation is “the deep reform of justice” which would be the element of considering the case by the judge “day after day”.
They also claimed that the subvention would be clear to school without the media of the authorities, or, according to them, without the costs related to the maintenance of officers.
The Confederation is also for “the strong Polish Army, based on Poland industry and half soldiers”.
The candidates to Seyma underlined the ability to increase the number of armies.
According to them, it also requires easier access to the protection.
In the economic areas, they underlined the need for “state access to energy”.
"We can gaze carbon, we have a lot of geotermal energy layer, we also need to develop back to the atomic electricity idea," said the fifth in the selective list of Peter Karpiński.
Mexican cartridge is one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago - then, after the sunrise of the West Side in Chicago CBS News, she related to the morning of drugs.
Brian McKnight from the Office for Drugs (DEA) showed in full light what was happening.
In Chicago the past year, almost 800 people died from drugs.
McKnight stated that the drugs are likely 90% in Chicago from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican Narcotic Lord Nemesio Cervantesia, just known as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for DEA and directly for federal executive bodies in the United States," Matthew Donahue, the major DEA agent in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped to discover the tens placed in the jungle of drugs in El Mencho.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs to the United States on the ground and sea road.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartle changed "tone" of cocaine, metamphetamine and heroin of unclean fentanyl.
The El Mencho head is waiting for a recompense of $10 million.
As an iron, he lived 30 years ago in California, where he was arrested for drug-related arrests and finally deported to Mexico.
He's just creating a brutal card there.
He has a huge quantity of defense, RPG, 50 calibre defense.
The leader has his own SWAT circuits," added Donahue.
El Mencho protects without prejudice his own, using such measures, such as shooting the helicopter of the Mexican army, killing six people, or participating in the public learning of this year.
In the past years, the brutality of the cartridge led to those murderers.
In accordance with the statistics of the Mexican Government, 94 murderes are reached daily.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be taken without protective equipment.
In the cocaine package, it means a markup of cocaine.
For more than one third of them, followers lead to El Mencho.
"This is he responsible for sending a truck that kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when a child dies, Donahue says that there is a "great chance" that drugs come from the organization of El Mencho.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year.

Run, strike and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Underbeskide and will win.
Stomilu's pillars from three series are unfounded.
The guardians of Peter Zwenzkowski at that time received seven points because they won with the Station of Milk and Chojnican Chojnice, and in the last shot a free remise in Suwelk.
Now the Spanish team on Saturday at 18 hours will take the Podbeskid, which is mentioned as one of the fa's for the advance to the Extraclass.
The nearest Rivals of Stomilu take the fourth place in the table and have a point of preference over the cycle of Olsztin.
The subbeshkid at the outcome of this season played six times and counted after two victories, remissions and injuries of Natomiast Stomil is very well feeling on its object – at the stadium at al. Pilsudski 69a seasons of Peter Zhandzkowski wined three times and once lost.
In total, in the nine rows, 17 points have been gathered and are in the table chair, although after two breaks at the start of the game, there was nothing to do.
"Each change needs time to be results," explains Peter Skib.
“Well, at the end, something was in our mind, we were in ourselves, and we can work in normal conditions.
We've just got a ball game.
There are clean heads, it's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a powerful training stage."
On Tuesday, the pilgrims of Stomilu were eliminated from Puchar Polski Mountains, but they needed dogs and a series of punishes.
On the south of Poland, Peter Skib, Gregorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go, because the trainer Zvingzkowski had given this key leaders to rest before the Sabbath Pool with Subbeskid.
Instead, in Cross, he played a returner after Jacob Mosakowski, who finally shot his expected gate.
“It's always nice to keep the naked, and I've still found on that moment that we can continue playing in the puzzles (Mosawski compared 3:3 in the 119th minute - red).
Dad often kidnapped me and laughed that I couldn't break the doors, and I always told him that I would shoot at the moment when he wouldn't wait."
Now Mosakowski counts back to the main storage, the more he can't play O'h Tarasenko because of the cards.
"This is why I'm strictly attracting training to be able to play in the first composite," says Mosakowski.
“In Cross, I did everything to stop me as well.
But if I'm playing, whether I'm sitting on the reserves, I'm going to be the same strong team.
Because the most important is the circuit and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
We are certainly waiting for a hard meeting in which victory will need to run, strike and fight."
In the middle of the Spanish defense, he can still play Rafál Remisz, who has recently gained an urine, so if it happens, we will only learn on Saturday, as much as the trainer Zwenzkowski traditionally at the end of the case is trying to do with the secret.
The man violated and killed her sister
"You will never see the daylight.
You'll never breathe freshly again," Judge Kevin K. Allen said, returning to Alex Whipple.
"What you have done was so refreshing and subsequent that you have to keep life in prison," he added.
The five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search was a long time until Whipple showed the place to hide you.
"How could anyone do this to his own sister?" asked Dejay's uncle.
"You're the worst person that mankind has to offer," he said to Alex Whipple.
"Where I'd go all to meet her again, get up with her," said the mother of a murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same anymore," added a disappointed woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year Whipple did not show any emotions during hearing.
In the past month, he admitted that he was broken, used sexually and killed a girl.
The man's lawyer claimed that his client was grown in a "perfect family".
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple has the sense that he has done a terrible act and is ready to be punished.
The male has been punished for life without the possibility of seeking a conditional release.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would deliver nearly 100 million dollars of assets to the sugar.

A temptation to welcome the Prime Minister in Pekars Slà
A personal test was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateus Moravic in Pekars Slà.
"The current state, the vote, the vote, we don't welcome Mr. Prime Minister here!
Let's scan with the voice: Ma-te-ush!", he urged the leader.
Unfortunately, enthusiast leadership efforts did not have a expected result.
The campaign is choosing.
Politici are running throughout the country, convinced the electors to themselves.
The intensive campaign also leads to Prime Minister Mateus Morawicki, who is a leader of the Slawish letter of PiS as a frequent guest in this region.

Ronald Lee Haskell: Mankind sentenced for the murder of his former family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced for the killing of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring in Texas.
The authorities entered the Stay's house on 9 July 2014, requesting the release of their residence, Melannie Haskell, with which he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys in the age of 13 and 4 years, and two girls in the age 9 and 7 died when Haskell had a fire, as he said of the Harris Sheriff of Harris.
Only one member of the family survived, 15-year-old then Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed that she was hardly wounded, but she was fully healthy.
On Thursday, the defense of Ronald Lee Haskella was based on unread.
Lava at the lake will be gathered again on Monday to issue a sentence.
Quantity Internet more closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The outcome of the American Army's research provides the Quantity Internet for a closer step.
Such Internet could offer security, discovery and accuracy opportunities that are not available in the traditional approach to the establishment of a network.
The Centre for the Extended Quotal Transfer of Warrior Information Laboratorium for the Development of Powers of Army Wars was observed to researchers from the University of Insbruck, which had been able to achieve a record transfer of the state of material and light – a distance of 50 km from the worldwide cabs.
Splitting is a corelation, which can be reflected in quantities such as cubits.
When two cubits are covered and the measurement of one of them, it will affect the measurement made on the other, even the second cubit is physically remote.
“These [50 km] are two rows of size further than it was possible before and it is a remote distance to start the building of the intermediate quarter networks”, said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physics from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, which was published in the Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
Intermediate quantity networks would be consistent with remote nodes of physical cubits, which are covered with themselves despite a large distance of physics.
The investigators claimed that this extension of the state of deterioration is necessary for the use of the quota internet.
"This demonstration is a number of steps in progress to achieve the expansive state of great scale," said Dr. Sarah ́le, co-governmental programme for these studies.
The quality of the state at the second end is also too high in order to address some of the most difficult applications of the quantity network.
The bath team was experiencing the experiment from the vampire atom imprisoned in the jon.
With the help of laser researchers, they entered the quantity status in jon, simultaneously encouraging it to eject the photos in which the quantity information was recorded.
The results of the quantity state of the atom and the parts of the light have been cut down.
The challenge is to send a photon with a lightweight cable.
"Foton is embedded by wapney jon has 854 nanometers and is quickly embraced by the lightway," said Lanyon.
Thus, his team first sent a part of the light through the non-line cristal highlighted by the powerful laser.
The length of the photonail was transmitted to the optimal value from the view of the sending point to large distance – the current standard telecommunication of the vale is 1550 nanometers.
The following researchers sent this photon through a 50-km cable of light.
Their measurements show that the atomes and parts of the light were split in a further row even after transmission of the whale and transition of this distance.
“The decision on the heating choice means that this result guides the direct path for the screening of the atomic clock network in large physical divisions, since the weapons can be associated with the high quality of the “clock” cubit.
The army is very interested in the covered clock networks built on a large scale because of the application of the precise setting of positions, precise navigation and synchronization of time," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a researcher who also supports the program.
