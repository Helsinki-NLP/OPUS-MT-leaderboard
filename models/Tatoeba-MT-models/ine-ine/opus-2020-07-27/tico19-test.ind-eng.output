How long have these signs been spent?
And all the tissues must be handled in this way in your age.
and together with the winds
and blood pressure and cholesterol you also need to be checked.
And you're going to be crazy now?
And are you feeling this crap now?
And do you have difficulties to retreat?
And can you tell other signs that you are natural together with this sign?
And how high are you?
And I'm also crazy.
And I'm a little pills and rocks.
And I felt a weighty damage today.
And this is an allergic time.
and feels a weight of grass.
And I also think I'm a little tired.
And I want you to explain the place of your tissue.
And they also are silent.
and with your diabetes history
And you know, my damn feels like it's gonna be cool.
And do you know, people always cut in my direction?
And you're feeling deep.
And you say there's a pressure on your ass
whoever in the family has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Are there any signs or other problems that you care for with the brain’s nutrition?
Does someone else sick like you at home with the same signs?
Do you feel other signs?
Have you ever felt appealing?
Are you still feeling awesome?
Because this is a floor.
but we should not be able to make the hearts of the breastfeeding
But the more important problem now is this damn kid.
And I felt difficult to break up
But I know a lot of people in my direction
But we need to handle the damage very seriously.
But can you now be able to do good?
I'm really forgotten by the cause of this crap.
Does it seem to be someone who puts your hands on?
Still feels like a snake.
Did they get sick with the same signs?
Do you have a chronic problem such as high blood pressure or its engineering?
Do you have medical problems or other chronic diseases such as diabetes?
Do you feel that you have a grip with the tissue?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you feel that you are awake with the signs?
Do you know what the signs it experienced?
Have you seen what it says?
drink a lot of hours today.
But I'm running diabetes tests.
but he has signs that are very like me.
How high is your tissue?
How is your blood pressure?
if you're going to continue.
if you've got a hundred or more.
If you think you're a signal or a problem, you need better review
I was stuck yesterday.
I'm also a little tired.
I was stuck yesterday.
I felt funny here, in my damn.
I also felt difficult to rebuke
I'm going to send a message to you.
I feel funny today.
I just felt a little head- and honey pain today.
According to me, this is a flu.
I think it's a little flow.
Does it seem to be a very heavy person sitting on your ass?
Everyone begins from the head's pain, with a thief, at the hot time together.
I felt sick in the middle of my damn
pressure like a damn nine
in my head
in the middle of my bridge
in the middle of the table
I've experienced a funny in my head.
I'm very worried about this damn kid.
I want you to explain this kidney.
like high blood pressure or diabetes
like right in the middle of the dawn
For her soil, you can drink sweet tachipirin.
Mary, how many days have you experienced this sign?
You're saying you're feeling crazy.
Sometimes I felt awesome
Well, are there any other signs with these signs, except the feeling of noise?
Or someone sits on your ass?
The same shade as the wind, the rocks, the head pain, and the breastness of the breasts.
Right in the middle of my damn
Break in this place where you feel sick
Because you're silent.
So, do you think some of these signs may have been related to danger?
So, your kids have some of the same signs?
Tell me about your kidney
the hole increased at night
I've been walking for two days.
the wind started growing last night.
This is Dr. Porter at the triase center of the airport.
Can you tell you more about your tissue?
I felt nervous in front of my body, here, in the dawn.
I felt a strong nine in my breast.
When I felt that dream in my mouth
What do you feel in your ass?
When the fuck's starting?
In what part do you feel funny in the dawn?
In what part do you feel a damage?
You're feeling like a shit in your ass.
Do you know that I'm throwing diabetes and other diseases?
You're saying you're feeling this kidney.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) competitive incidence which rapidly increased in the European Union/Willy of European Economics and England, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The competitive incidence of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) shows the same trend in the EU/Willy of European Economics and English Raya that, despite its different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic developed very quickly in all countries.
Based on Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units, it should increase its preparation for the promotion of COVID-19 patients that will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, pneumonia is not known in Wuhan, the Province Hubei, Tiongkok.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre of Control and Tiongkok illness reported this cussatitive disease agent is a new coronavirus now called coronavirus syndrome of acute disorder 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since that time, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence until now shows that approximately 80% of the COVID-19 COVID-19 is suffering from low illness, the infection of illness with or without pneumonia, with most of these newspapers is healing.
In approximately 14% of the case, COVID-19 developed to a heavyer disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases experience critical diseases that need intensive care.
The mortality of patients cared in the hospital resulted in COVID-19, approximately 4%.
In this study, we took COVID-19 competitive trends in the EU/Willyah European Economic (EU/EA) and England Raya (UK) and then compared it to incidences in the Hubei province, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of cases COVID-19 currently in the EU/EA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020.
Cases COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the United States
At the Tiongkok, COVID-19 experienced a higher geographical preachment and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemics in other parts of the world when this is following the pandemic dynamic in Tiongkok.
On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization Director-General (WHO) stated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, issued on 5 March, Spiteri et al., the first Europeans reported the case COVID-19 based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, cases COVID-19 were detected in all 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020, including 39.768 cases and 1.727 cases of death, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 death from Italy.
Contains the simulation and simulation of the case COVID-19.
At the Centre of Europe’s Sickness and Control (ECDC), the number of cases COVID-19 announced by the country worldwide at 8:00 p.m., this number was only obtained from the natural sources such as the National Health Center, the National and Regional Health Authority, and the WHO.
These data are used to explore COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the United States, and compare them to the trains in Italy.
As the prevalence of the COVID-19 active case, we calculated the 14-day competitive incidence, so calculated the COVID-19 natural travel in EU/EA and the United States, between 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also consider the competitive statement of cases announced by the country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. compared to the case of Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
The 14-day COVID-19 case trains in the EU/EA and the United States were followed by trains in Hubei (Tiongkok) (Fig. 1).
For EU/EEA and the United States, the COVID-19 competitive instance began to increase about 21 February, and then increased the trends around 28 February 2020.
This train is primarily moved by the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United States show the same COVID-19 simultaneous trends.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK is compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
The data reported that until 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United States have reported the total number of cases compared to the total number of cases of Italy three weeks before or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 which were announced have rapidly increased in the EU/EEA and the United States.
The train observed at the COVID-19 competitive incidence suggested that pandemics increased at the speed that is likely in all countries.
This is beyond the differences in the countries, the response for society's health, and the possibility of the definition of cases between the country and the protocol differences to consider patients tested for the conference of COVID-19, which includes the exam.
In the beginning of March 2020, the Italian doctors who looked forward explained about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources to report that hospitals and intensive care units in this area have reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case receipt data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA only are available for each 6% and 1% case (not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and death.
In 2010-2011, it shows a big variety in the provision of an intensive seat and Media care in Europe, starting from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 1000,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less power sources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and Media care for 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The most dangerous models of health care capacity, with the prevalence estimation of COVID-19 cases for EU/EA and the United States with a risk of > 90% of the capacity of intensive health care, is provided in the sixth ECDC rapid risk monitoring on COVID-19.
Since this case is classified in a specific territory in EU/EEA and the United States, and the hospitals and its general intensive care units serve a specific regional service population, information on cases and places of intensive care is best available at the United Wilayah Security destination for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italian experiences and trains today in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemics developed very quickly in the EU/EEA and the United States.
That is why the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and increase the number of patients COVID-19 needing health care, especially intensive care, as happens in Italia.
As it has been introduced in the rapid ECDC risk review recently, quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to slow down the SARS-CoV-2 preachment, with a view to the approach to the medical approach, because the fast number of cases, as expected, may not take enough time to decisions and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not applied before.
The rapid risk review also illustrates the social health steps to control the impact of the pandemics.
There is a window of opportunity that is available when the country has the possibility to increase its control efforts to late SARS-CoV-2 preaching and reduce the pressure on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA health care systems will be likely to confront patients who need intensive care within a few days or weeks ahead.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus acute disorder syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far been murdered over 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tiongkok and other places in the world, which cause human distress.
Mirip with his homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the bullet and causes similar signs through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has lower rates and mortality than SARS, but more clear and more about older than young people, and more for men than women.
As a response to the number of publications quickly increased on this new disease, this article tries to give exact time and understanding about quickly developing research issues.
We will discuss the bases of epidemiological, ethological, virological, diagnostic, diagnostics, predictions, and disease preventions.
Although many questions are still not answered, we hope that this will help us to understand the dangerous and dangerous diseases.
The Festival of Musim Semi on January 25, 2020 has become a memory that has never happened and is not forgotten for all Tionghoa who were ordered to stay home for a few weeks afterwards because of new virus diseases.
This virus is very approved with coronavirus (CoV) that causes an aggressive acute disorder syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, this virus was called SARS-CoV-2 by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease that was caused is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemi started in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread to the whole country and to 50 other countries worldwide.
By 2 March 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 COVID-19 cases configured, with more than 40,000 patients deceived and 3.000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the enemy of the enemy of number 1 and potential destruction is stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.日bi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, which sets up a virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 people have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis, and anxiety.
This is trying to start progress in the newly developing issues.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other illnesses caused by CoV, which are the Syndrome of the Middle East East (MERS, in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease preventions and some other questions that are not answered but encouraged.
Based on tradition, CoV was considered non-letal pattern for humans, mostly caused approximately 15% of pill 4.
However, in this century, we have reached a very patogenic CoV for humans twice, either SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of us caused the beginning of Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabs in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with morbidity and mortality.
That's why, COVID-19 is now the third CoV in the recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, Pneumonia class, which is originally unknown, was first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the Peoples of Tiongkok.
Seven days later, a CoV was destroyed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
During that time, the epidemic was quickly spread to the city, provinces, and neighbors.
On 20 January, health career infections were reported, which suggested that human transmission might happen.
On January 23, the areas were held in Wuhan, and the entire community was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confined cases, only 21 patients directly contacted the Wuhan sea markets considered as an initial infection site of unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared that it was a global health.
At the time of this report, this disease has been divided into the whole Tiongkok and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gbr. 2).
As the growth is quickly developed, the finishing talks and the divorce must still be fixed.
On 11 February 2020, the multiply studies of 8.866 patients, including 4.021 COVID-19 patients, were confined to the following epidemics (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHP1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections people in all the age, but mainly at the age 30-65.
A half (47.7%) of those infected are more than 50 years, only a few under 20 years, and only 14 infections under 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 is more infected by men (0.31.100.000) than women (0.27.100.000).
COVID-19 spread in a class, mainly within and around Hubei.
COVID-19 eats time 5 (2-9) days start from news to diagnosis.
The incubase period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The time of the rates starting from the advertising to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 corresponds to 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections increased expensively before June 23, 2020, according to massive transportation time before the Festival of the Musim Semi in Tiongkok.
Patient mortality with configured cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality corresponded to all patients with 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are types of gender (man), age (≥ 60 years), and weight pneumonia.
CoV is a larger virus subfamily collecting which is a part of a single RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genus, as well as alfa, beta, and delta, with alpha and beta-CoV is known to infect humans.
Glicoprotein tonola or spike (S) is associated with its cell receptor, angiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and peptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then the membrane fusy occurred.
Genom RNA virus was released into sytoplasma; after the replication through virus, the GNA is genetic with glucoprotein samples and nucleocapsid proteins constituted viruses, which then experienced fusy with plasma membranes to release virus.
According to SARS-CoV-2, the first report was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of beta-CoV with genetic equality more than 99.98% of the 10 following samples; the sample was taken from the locality of the origin, the Huan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Geneticly, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By means of transmission of electronic microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particulate was found in the part of a very typical human pressure epitelium.
ACE2 humans found is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the protein S SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2 humans weaker than its image with SSARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are unseparated by SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also construct new hedge proteins signed with orf3b and proteins excluded with orf8.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may play in the virus pathogenity and IFNb expression inhibition; but orf8 does not have a known functional or motive domain.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, etal. reported the croo-EM ACE2 crew structure in resolution 2,9 W in complex with aminosure transporter B0AT.
They discovered that the complex, which has open and closed information, has been involving dimmer and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can have two proteins S, which have been evidence of knowledge and CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be the most apetic ingredient in the medicine record to press SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and mediators
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from the widows and each of them are transmitted to humans through enemies and uncles.
With the SARS-CoV-2 philosophic comparison with another CoV, the bullet is considered as the original SARS-CoV-2 input because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoV similar-SARS from the bullet called bath-SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate memory that helps the virus to decrease the species of human infection is still unknown, and the path of transmission must still be explained.
Ji, etal. exhibits a serpent as a virus from a bleeding to a human who involves the homologous recombination in the protein S.
According to a study, a researcher in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, concluded that 99% of the genetic homologation of CoV found in the calling and SARS-CoV-2 were used in a traditional medication of Tionghoa.
Yet, 1% of the differences in the whole genom are still a great difference; therefore, the conclusions as specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Section 3).
SAS-CoV-2 physicochemical property is not known yet.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can endure 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% slowness.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same quality.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfektion that contains chlorine, exacerbation, chloroform, and other fluids, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disable virus.
Generally, all human populations have no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and that's why it's a rate against this new virus.
Currently, there's not yet an expensive study reporting about immunological responses against SARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only go to another CoV investigation before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
Generally, after invasion of invasion, virus is recognised by immunity systems through poly-receptor (PRR), which includes C-type electin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
By different ways, the virus induces fluctuation factor expressions, dendric cell maturity, and interferon type I (IFN) synthesis that restricts virus prevention and accelerates virus antigen fagositosis by ́rofag.
However, N protein at SARS-CoV can help virus avoid immune response.
Shortly afterward, immune response was associated with the fight against this virus.
T limphosite, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defence.
Cell T CD4+ simulate B cells to produce a specific antibody against virus, and T CD8+ cells killed that are infected directly.
Cell T helps produce pre - inflammation sitokins to help protect cells.
However, CoV can affect cell T by inducing the apoptosis cell T.
Humor immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also important in the fight against virus infection.
For example, an isolated antibody from the patients who have been healing MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overall immune reactions resulted in a large number of radical free locally, which could cause harmful damage on poultry and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, the deficiency of organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, signed with a news class, more about age with pregnancy and pregnancy disease.
In general, those who have been infected in a large number or whose immune functions have a higher chance of infecting than others.
The incubation period estimation of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most of the 3-7 days based on the 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1.099 cases shows that the rate incubation period is 3 days and starts from 0 to 24 days.
The newer, as explained above, shows that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is important that health authorization determine the efficient period of karantine based on the most precise period of incubation that prevents the infected, but without signs, transmits virus to others.
As a general practice, a person who is infected with virus or who is usually infected should be carantined for 14 days.
Should the time of karantine be extended to 24 days?
COVID-19 is often the primary and early signs, with or without other signs such as dry rocks, throat, nerves, nerves, limbs, head pain, nerve pain, rinorea, damage, diarrhoea, nausea, and madness.
Some patients experience dispnea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness report.
In a severe case, the development of patients’s diseases continued to become acute disorder syndrome, sectical sugar, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopatia.
Patients who experience deepness and/or signs of inflammation and accumulation, despite the rate of the inflammation, must be signed against virus for diagnosis.
Demography at the end of December 2019 shows that the percentage of signals is 98 per cent for the dry, 76 per cent for the dry coat, 55 per cent for dispnea, and 3 per cent for the diar; 8 per cent of patients need ventilator support.
The same findings were reported in these two recent studies, a study of the family classer and a classer that caused transmission by azymto people.
Similarly, the demography study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced mildness (98%), thickness (47%) and dispnea (55%) as a major sign.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the MERS capital higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and inflammation disease (21%) also observed in MERS patients.
In the SARS patients, silver (99%-100%), thick throat (29-75%), dysnea (40-42%), diarr (20-25%), and inflammation disease (13-25%) is reported as the main signal and ventilation support required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
By February 14, the COVID-19 mortality is 2% with the configured case reached 66.576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, 37% of the 2.494 cases of mortality were constructed.
It was previously reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with the interval of confidence (CI) 95% is 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only triggers 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in signs, mortality, and R0 is found in Table 1.
These elements show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher skill than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not a number of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemies is greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The newspapers often are classified in a family or from a assembly or a vehicle such as an aircraft ship.
Patients often have traveling or living in Wuhan or in other areas of view or contact infectionates or sisters within the last two weeks before newspapers.
However, it is reported that people can bring virus without showing signs of more than two weeks, and the patient from the hospital can carry out another virus, which results in an increasing karantine time.
At the first stage, the patient has a white blood cell (in particular limfosis) normally or down.
For example, limfopenia with white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes lymphosite < 1x109/L, and the aminotransferase aspartate and viremia increased in 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
When heart enzymes and muscles and myglobins increased in blood, and C-reactive proteins and blood-conditions increased in most patients.
In the patient with heavy case, D-dimer increased, it is the product of fibrin in the blood, and the limphosite lows progressively.
The photography was found in the majority of COVID-19 patients and signed with bilateral blackness or ground-glass opacity in the pool.
Patients often experience athistic pneumonia, accurate powder, and aggressive syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, taktercontroll inflammation, accumulation, and progressive phybrosis has been extremely affected by gas pollution.
Disfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases surface and increases the surface pressure so that it reduces the potential of the powder to develop and increase the risk of colaps.
Thus, the worst finding on the toracic photo often is parallel to the worst illness.
On February 18, 2020, the first patologics COVID-19 analysis shows the decoration of pneumocytes, definition of hyalin membrane, and interstitial lymphosite infiltration, and syncital cells are prejudiced to many patients who died because of this disease, according to the pathology of virus infection and ARDS, as well as the patological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because its high negative rates, which can accelerate epidemia, the clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations also occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, combination between disease reports, clinical manifestation, the tests of eniuum, and radiological findings is very important and the need to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per input) using the buffer in less than one hour without needing a summary instrumentation.
Maybe this new technology can increase the sensitivity and potential if it is verified in clinical samples.
Since at least the experience with the new CoV, the primary doctor offers supporting patients with COVID-19, trying a number of therapies previously used or proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other virus diseases (Table 2).2
It includes the current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral medicines, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma of patients who have been cured, traditional Tionghoa medicines, and psychological support.
Even plasma of patients who have been cured is suggested to be used in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company runs to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the first stage, SARS-CoV-2 was primarily attacked by the pool and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2 in a lower rate, such as gastrointestinal and genial system.
However, the disorder and failure are the main threats for patients and causes of death.
Thus, the support of the inflammation is very important to protect signs and save life, which includes oxygen therapy, high alliation oxide, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the rate of disease.
Patients with heavy disorders must be supported with extracorporeum membrane oxidation (ECMO), which is the cardiopulmoner-modified technique used for heart failure or injury that threaten the soul.
Furthermore, the electrolytic balance, the prevention and monitoring of secondary and sectical infections, and the protection of the vital organ function also is important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
A more known immune system reaction causes the sitokin body to the SARS and MERS patients.
Sitokins are the form of systemic infrastructure response signed by the relief of sitokins, which include TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNa, IFNb, IFNg, and MCP-1.
These sitokins induce immune cells to release a large number of radical freedoms that are the primary cause of ARDS and the failure of major organs.
Immunosupression is vital in sitokins, especially in deep patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies have been used to handle sitokins.
Other immunosuppressive interventions for sitokins include the modulation of immune response cell T; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; sitokin 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroid, as immunosuppression, is used in the SARS’s care to reduce fluctuation disorders.
However, steroids at high dose are not used for heavy powder in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids can cause heavy effects, especially osteonecrosis, which affect the prediction.
However, corticosteroids have been placed at the low dose until they are urged to be taken carefully to COVID-19 patients who are critical.
In this report, there is no effective antivirus treatment that has been confiscated.
However, remdesivir's terms intravenously, as a nucleotic analogy, were registered in a COVID-19 patients from America.
Desivir is a new antivirus medicine developed by Gilead, first for diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also shows inhibition against RNA virus, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead delivered this thing for Tiongkok to test the test of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the result was very unexpected.
Moreover, baricitinb, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute disorders.
Diare, injury, injury, heart damage, and other reactions may occur after therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This interaction with other medicines used by the patient must be directly addressed.
Plasma from patients who have been cured and antibodies
There is a long story of the blood collection of patients who have been healed from illnesses to treat other patients who have treated the same disease or to prevent the healthy persons of the disease.
In fact, patients who have been healing often have relatively high antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) that produced limfosite B to combat patogen and other foreign things, recognized the unique molecule on patogens, and directly controlled it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from blood of a patient who has been healed from COVID-19 and has been dedicated to 10 heavy sick patients.
Their signs are in 24 hours, together with inflammation and virus grapes and increase oxygen saturation in blood.
However, verification and clarification needs to add this method to use a large scale before specific therapy is developed.
Furthermore, other than the efficacy, some plasma failures should be meditated exactly.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune responses overwhelmed and cause a sytokine release syndrome, which is a potential toxicity that threatens souls.
The antibody concentration in its usually low blood and plasma is needed in a large number of patients to care for critical diseases.
The development and production of specific antibodies are quick enough to combat global difficult epidemics.
Therefore, more important and practical isolation of cell B from patients who have been healed and identified genetic codes that suggest effective antibodies or make an effective antibodies signature for proteins that are important for virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on the combination of various components in the formula, which differently depends on the TCM theory diagnosis.
Most of the effective components are still not known or not clear because it is difficult to stretch or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, because there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative therapies for patients with low signals until it is or for a person who is removing the heat disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found honest for therapy with COVID-19.
COVID-19 patients are noticed in some TCM provinces that use TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei provinces, which use TCM only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, have limited health rates (13%).
However, this comparison is still very difficult because many other factors of impact, such as the number of patients, must be determined in assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends emplubized a study that compares western medicine therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM.
They discovered that the time needed for the recovery of the body was lost, and it was lost the signs, and the windscape was much more severe than WM+TCM.
More increasingly, the WM+TCM width is much lower than WM+TCM (7.4% than 46.2%) and the WM+TCM lower mortality is compared to WM+TCM only (8.8% over 39%).
However, the efficiency and safety of the TCM are still waiting for a better controlled test at the larger and more research centres.
Another interesting thing is to examine work mechanisms and clarify effective components in TCM or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients who were able or confined to COVID-19 felt very afraid of a very disturbing and even this disease, and those who were carantined also felt disappointment, singleness, and anger.
Furthermore, signs of infection such as a snake, hypoxie, and throat and the effect of therapy, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
At the early phase of the SARS, psychiatric morbidity, which includes depression, anxiety, panic attack, psychomotor attacks, psychological signs, delirium, and even self-subsidy has been reported.
The reporting of contacts and web caretins, as part of the public health response to COVID-19, can make people worse and feel frightened to the effects of output, karantine, and stigma about friends and friends.
That is why mental health care must be provided for COVID-19 patients, those who are aware, and those who contact them, and the public society that needs.
Psychological support must include the definition of multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate relations about SARS-CoV-2, and the treatment plans, and the use of the administration and electronic applications to avoid contacts close to each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to meet the transmission of animal and human reserves to rental and often prevent antiviral therapy in control of epidemics caused by viral immunities.
The effort has been able to develop the basic S protein vaccine, which has made a long and effective antibody antibodies and/or immunity protecting against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life-diluted vaccine has been evaluated in test animals.
However, the efficiency of this in vivo vaccine in age and models of critical challenges and its protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because the SARS was 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since that time.
Instead, the case of Sporadis and the MERS classter continues to occur in the East and spread to other areas because there are continuing a zoonotic source in the endemic area.
vaccination has been developed for MERS using inactive DNA virus, virus vektor, nanopartic particles, and recombination protein subunits and some have been devaluated in test animals.
The development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which is safe and effective for non-immunity people is a very urgent and important task to control the continuing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome because long time to develop vaccine (grade 18 months) and dynamic CoV variation.
As a new illness, COVID-19 just started showing a full clinical trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can be able to cure without that.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also threatened with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Thus, it is important for health care to provide priority in the area, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the long reported clinical studies, the following factors can affect or be pained by the COVID-19 patient forecast (Table 3):
Usia: Usia is the most important factor for the SARS projection, which is also for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred at age 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in study of 8.866 cases as explained above.
Patients needing intensive care are increasingly affected by age and complication and age significantly more than those who do not need intensive infection (as age 66 over 51 years), which provide the age as a prognosic factor for the end of COVID-19 patients.
The genetic species: SARS-CoV-2 is more infected by men than women (0.31/100,000 over 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complication: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care have greater probability to experience acute and arithmic heart crazy.
The heart’s experience also reminds us of the main cause of death in the SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be accessible with cologiosite with ACE2-~if, which can cause the disfunction of heart in COVID-19 patients.
Age and sickness that are based on coherence and affect one another must be advised.
Anormal finding: When C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the inflammation or network inflammation and is presented as potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recycling.
Correlation between the CRP and the deal and the COVID-19 projection has also been proposed.
Furthermore, dehydrogenase concentration (≥ H), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and kinase creatin (CK) can also help to predict the final results.
These enzymes are very high in various organs, especially in hearts and hearts, and are released during network disorders.
That's why these enzymes are traditional signs for dilution of hearts and hearts.
Main clinical signs: Torax and temporary clinical signal development should be considered together with other things to predict the end results and complications of COVID-19.
steroid use: As explained above, the steroid is an immunosuppression that is largely used as an infection illness to reduce the inflamatory disorder.
Since high-dosis corticosteroids are used in SARS heavy patients, many who survived from this disease finally diminished avasive osteonecrosis with the power of all life and bad quality of life.
That's why, if necessary, steroids should be used at low dose and low time for COVID-19 patients.
Minor pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19, many patients have an extraordinary stress because they have to carry out a long and extreme inconvenience and have anxiety to the death of family members nearby and neighbors.
Psychological concerts and long-term support must be given to help this patient get out of stress and return to normal life.
Based on this demography study, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological approach to SARS.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively applied to the upper-shirt and cause a bad signal or without signs at the early infection phase, as well as another CoV that causes pills.
That is why, at the early stage or incubacy time, infected patients can result in a large number of viruss during daily activity, which causes big challenges to control epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission was trusted when the sick and most of them did not occur in the early phase.
Thus, COVID-19 is now far worse and difficult to be controlled than SARS.
Currently, great efforts are in Tiongkok, which includes quarters of Wuhan areas and cities around, and quarantines are surprised by the whole population with the hope of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although this action is very disrupted by the economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is down, which reduces the deterioration of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states that the wheat will end in March and the phase of generation spent for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts do not feel that.
Paul Hunter et al. appreciates that COVID-19, which seems to be far more low than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, etal. make a model to predict the end of the epidemic and state that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
Canadian researcher group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-konka and hit the patients who have been healed and returned from the hospital 2 weeks ago. This indicates that the virus that is identified back could be repeated, like influenza.
Nevertheless, signs promised to happen in Tiongkok, if it was seen based on it, the number of new cases, which show that the strategy could be successful at this time.
Ebola’s first prediction would cause a million cases with half death.
However, with karantine and strong isolation, this disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 disturbs its ability to infect and finally disappear or become a virus is not too patogenic that can damage humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS epidemics is shown below (Gr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmissible through rocks or spins, and may also be through direct contact with boxes contaminated by virus.
This virus was also found in the festivals so it moves the potential of new transmission, which is the transmission of feses.
Recently, in 138 cases reported that 41% of the case may be caused by soocomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health careers.
In order to protect humans, especially health careers, social workers, family members, fellow workers, and even those who have the right contact with patients or infected persons.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is using the face mask, well-maske and N95 respirator mask (number 1860s) help to control the virus preliminary.
The masker cares for the infections of those who are infectionate not to follow the air or stick on the surface of the wheat, where it can be forwarded to others.
However, only N95 masker (number in the 1860s) that can protect the inhalation of virion with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion can be completely controlled; SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV in the size, both are about 85 nm.
Since the particules can control even five maskers that were thrown into one, health care providers directly contacted with patients should use N95 (number 1860) and not a mask.
Furthermore, health career should use the isolated clothes to reduce the contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2, although he used N95 mask; virus may be entered into his body through the eyes.
Therefore, the health career should also use the faces of an eye - bearing or anxiety to work with the patients.
For public society in the area that is viewed or emphasised, it is very recommended for people to cut their hands with more frequently infected samples than usually, trying to stay in the house for carantine, and avoid contact with infected people.
Three feet feet were cut into the guard of the patient’s distance.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus preliminary.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high type of SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must be a great warning for Tiongkok who has a strong memory of the SARS in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Sickness Centre overlooked the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of preachment and the ability to reproduce from humans to humans and disorders and diseases is not a problem.
This is very deeply aware of the public fear, especially when the whole country is preparing the Muslim Semi Festival, so that this critical time passed to deal with small diseases in Wuhan.
Thoongkok’s illness controls should take a lesson from this and make a big test in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because it was said to be advised by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to non-clinical information than waiting for a clinical report of the doctor or responsible employee; (3) more limited to the potential of dealing with the epidemic at the early stage and not to try to overcome the public; and (4) more frequently enhance public training and efficiency to increase the conscience of disease epidemics and to enhance public response systems periodically.
COVID-19 was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to shoot at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the walls have spread to the whole Tiongkok and over 50 countries worldwide in this writing.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 signs and SARS also, COVID-19 members are renewed.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to discuss epidemics and treat patients.
COVID-19 more about older than young people and more about men than women, and death is also higher than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% above 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmitted virus even though they were without signs, while the SARS patients usually transmised virus when they were sick, which makes greater difficulties in supporting the COVID-19 preacher than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and greater than SARS-CoV.
Rutine RNA asylum to check SARS-CoV-2 can have negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been healed can have positive results on virus examination.
This finding has increased the risk of the virus preacher.
With so quickly the progress of the COVID-19 research, some important problems still need to be resolved, yes:
Where's SARS-CoV-2 coming from?
Although a genetic approximation of 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV similar-SARS is found, we can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is coming from the cover.
What animals have become a species of international for a virus from the origin, tell the human?
Without knowing the answers 1 and 2, we can't move the transmission effectively and we can't be able to get back at the time.
Although molecular and biochemical models show that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how exactly is the virus entered into the puzzle cell and caused the following pathological changes?
Is this virus also associated with cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot reach quick and accurate diagnosis and effective care.
How long will this epidemic continue?
How did the virus develop geneticly during human transmission?
Would this be a worldwide pandemic, like SARS, or again periodically as a flu?
The answers to questions above and many other words are very important, but it may take time to find it.
However, whatever it is worth, we have no other choice except to stop this epidemic as soon as possible to get back to normal life.
Zonotic human crown virus origin
During thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have moved the co-evolution of coron virus (CoV) and its inch, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause heat diseases, such as sequences.
The syndrome of heavy heavy inflammation (SARS) and the Syndrome of the Middle East Inflammation (MERS) reverses the situation and explains how much HCoV infection can be destroyed and threatened to souls.
It was SARS-CoV-2 at the center of Tiongkok at the end of 2019 that CoV had made a resort to us with high transmission, but with lower patogenity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis, so the HCoV original understanding will benefit us.
Most of the HCoVs came from the injury, and in this animal, the virus is not patogenic.
The recording of some HCoV has also been known.
The specifying animals have direct implication in preventing human diseases.
Research of CoV interactions in animals can also give an important account of the CoV patterns in humans.
In this campaign, we discussed the general knowledge of the currently seven HCoV, focusing on its discovery story and its zoonotic origin and its transmission of interspections.
The important thing, we compared and replaced the HCOV from the angle of evolution and recombination.
Epidemy CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
Moreover, the provisions of inflammation and the implication of virus evolution in diseases are also insorbited.
Corona virus (CoV) originated from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a RNA virus pool, is a positive influence, and a unique happiness.
This virus has the biggest genom of 26 to 32 kilobase between RNA virus called CoV, because its morphology is similar to rock under electronic microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has a non-segmentated genom that has similar expressions.
About two thirds of the genom consists of two large-open reading (ORF1a and ORF1b) that move each other. Both are translated to pp1a and pp1ab replication polyprotein.
Poliprotein experiences more amazing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genom consists of the open reading (ORF) for structural proteins, including tonjolan or spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of protective proteins for certain generations are also signed by various CoV generations.
On the basis of the differences on the proteins, CoV was classified to four genus (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genuses, the beta-CoV genus had the most of HCoV and was divided into four seed lines (A, B, C and D).
The philosophic evidence shows that the physician and animals are the source of most of the genes of alfa-CoV and beta-CoV, while the main reserve of CoV and delta-CoV.
During thousands of years, CoV continued to interfere with species deteriorations, and some of the CoVs have become an important pattern for humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs (HCoVs) known.
Among these seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfa-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronary syndrome (SARS-CoV), Corona syndrome of the East Inflammation Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are usually caused to raw signs, such as pills and/or diares.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very patogenic, causes weighted infections on relatively more patients and has a higher opportunity to develop acute disturbance syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation outside the poor organs.
Strain HCoV-229E first, B814, was isolated from the next patient in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through a deep study against HCOV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both caused their own healthy signs.
Even, this concept has been largely accepted that HCoV infection is generally not dangerous until the SARS has occurred.
The SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastated in the history, which infected more than 8.000 people with anxiety death.
Ten years later, the Symptom of the Middle East (MERS) caused a surprising epidemic in the Arabic Convenience with the Spanish Preach to a number of other parts of the world.
HCoV new 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is the following called SARS-CoV-2, was the cusatitive epidemic of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), who has enhanced life over 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been hidden and the world has to prepare himself for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics that will come.
The seven HCoVs have all the zoonotic origins of the throat, the tissue, or the animals.
Many evidences support the evolution of all HCoV from the crash. In the past, CoV is acting well and unpatogenic, but shows a great genetic attitude.
COVID-19 Epidemy has caused medical, scientific, social, and extreme moral challenges for Tiongkok and the whole world.
The HCoV phonotic discovery reduces the work to understand the natural history, the movement, and the factor of the statement is the movement between species.
This can also lead or facilitate the search of animal reserve, intermediately, and the amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in preaching preventions in the future.
In this campaign, we gave public information about the zoo, the transmission of the interspections, and even the HCoV.
We especially oriented and discussed the general subject that HCoV induced virus is usually unpatogenic in its natural reservation, but become patogenic after transmission of an interspection into the new woods.
We also examined the HCoV evolution trend that transmissions are often accompanied with pathogenism.
The end of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E isolation of the first B814 strategy of the sequential patient, several CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, which include calciums, tissues, rubbers, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last lawyers, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The history of HCoV findings in the chronological order (Table 1) is a informative text.
Strain HCoV-229E first was isolated from a patient insufficiency in 1966, which was adjusted to grow in WI-38 cell lines.
Patients infected by HCoV-229E showing sequences, which include head pain, spine, forestry, and inflammation pain, together with tissue and stones that appear at 10~20% of the case.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organic culture and a series of travelling in a white brain that is still awakened.
The clinical inhibition of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomaticly unable to be distinguished by the infection of other inflammation patterns such as influenza A and rhinovirus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread throughout the world and are the most expensively transmissible during the cold season in the surrounding area.
Of course, the incubation time of these two virus is less than one week and is followed with a painful time for about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people who have infected HCOV-229E have experienced a long time.
Only a few patients with a system of disorder system that shows the infection of a weighted inflammation.
SARS, also known as "atypic pneumonia", is the first HCoV consequences documented well in human history and its ethological agent was SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case of the SARS could be returned to the end of 2002 in the Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The SARS epidemic caused 8,096 cases to be reported with 774 deaths in many countries and neighbors.
Despite the super output, the case is considered can cause about two secondary cases, with 4-7 days incubase, and the virus disorders are seen on 10 days of illness.
The patients who were infected with SARS-CoV first experienced mialgia, head pain, honey, lessons, and kidnapping, followed by dispnea, rocks, and pressure as a sign of the next sign.
Limfopenia, an unusual heart function test, and the kinase creature is a lazyme at SARS.
Alveolary disorders, epithelic proliferation, and the inflammation of the virus are also observed in the SARS patients.
Next, approximately 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
Furthermore, some organs that include gastrointestinal, hearts, and gengals can also be infected in heavy cases, usually associated with sitokins, which can take place, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from the puzzle biopsy opened with zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since that time, effort has been highly trained for HCoV studies.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from age 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was very deceived by a young child, an age, and a weak patient who suffered from disorder diseases.
Corises, conjunctitis, dims, and bronchiolitis lazym were added to diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Others explain the same virus isolation of the species of children's age of eight months of age that describes pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It was thought that HCoV-NL63 was about 4.7% of the general disorder disease and its occurrence occurred at the beginning of the hot morning, the summer, and the winter morning.
HCoV-NL63 is scared with obstructive laringitis, which is also called crap.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been insulted for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Furthermore, Pneumonia and bronchiolitis community, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported in a division with acute asthma exaserbase.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide, caused to cold inflammation.
These four HCoV communities have been adapted to humans and generally have small probabilities of rotation to a very patogenic disease. However, an extraordinary case occurs because of unknown reasons, such as in the HCoV-NL63 subtypes, which recently reported to cause a weighted infection in Tiongkok.
In general, when they have the ability to move effectively and continue to maintain themselves in humans, the virulency and the potential of HCoV are also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old pair who experienced acute and injury pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases were confined from the Middle East, the cases of improving the secondary preaching to the staff have been reported in various countries of Europe and Tunisia.
Another secondary race occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confined cases.
MERS clinical demonstration is similar to SARS clinical manifestation, which is expressed with a progressive acute pneumonia.
Not as SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced a failure of acute genealogy, which has only occurred in MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients showed gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhoea and mood.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases constructed by a high case of death, which is 34.4%, made MERS-CoV one of the most fearful viruses known by humans.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, a class of pneumonia patients retrospectively threatened with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of the underlying infections that are being continued and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Survey and calls that disease COVID-19.
Until 3 March 2020, cases 90.053 have been constructed worldwide, with the deadlife of the case of 3.4%.
The case death in Hubei, Tiongkok, about 4.2%, while the accident death outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with silent, rocks, and throat.
Diare was also joined to a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most heavy signs and can quickly develop to an accurate disturbance syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to high nucleotic urine homologation, as well as 82%, both sprung into a different philytic tree chain.
SARS-CoV-2 Patogonism clearly below, but more clearly than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The subject of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported without signs and may be involved in the SARS-CoV-2 preaching quickly worldwide.
Comparing and distinguing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV shows a very interesting comparison and difference.
First, the incubacy and the traveling of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed the general train of six other HCoVs.
Second, the COVID-19 terms are placed between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On one side, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general inhibition of the HCoV Community infection, which includes non-economic signals or even without signs.
On the other hand, a small part of COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infection, despite a little lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting policies, having an opportunity with the HCoV community and SARS-CoV.
On one side, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at least equal to HCoV community.
On the other hand, it is not the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after some travel on humans still needs to be verified, such as cases SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Last, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the fees sample.
"Is SARS-CoV-2 oral oral transmission important, like in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least at a certain term, that must still be declared by the next study."
What is very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is musical like in the HCoV community case.
Anyway, SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission, patogenity, and a surprise preach in some ways on humans, will be very affected on the end of the 19th COVID-Ray which is going on.
Four of the HCoV community that causes rare signs have been adapted to humans.
Seeing from another angle of view, humans can say have been adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, well HCoV and humans may be a species of HCoV pandemic pandemic at the test time.
HCoV that caused heavy diseases on humans and humans who experienced heavy HCoV disease has been destroyed.
In order to do this, HCoV must be implemented in humans in a number that is possible to allow adaptive mutations to enable the effects of the investment factors.
Thus, as long as the SARS-CoV-2 has endured and more infected people, the greater probability of this virus is fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop the human transmission with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, four of the CoV communities fell in the population of humans and had a lot of people who were immunely competent.
This virus does not need animal reservation.
Rather, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV who are very patogenic have not yet been adapted to human and human transmissions.
We both need to maintain ourselves and make a role in the psychotic reservation and seek the opportunity to spread to interested human goals, probably through one or a few intermediaries and amplifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a comparison with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmised— like HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more patogenic than HCoV community and is not the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV patogenic.
It must continue to be considered whether SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and incirculated in humans without the memory of animal reservation or intermediate.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to consider the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservation, intermediate and amplification of HCoV.
The animal acts as a HCoV evolutionary memory if he has a nearby and shared high homologus in the nucleotic sequence.
The virus is usually adjusted with good adjustment and nonpatogenic characteristics in this cord.
Similarly, the memory of reservation has brought HCoV awesomely and in a long period of time.
In these two cases, the memory is naturally infected and is natural for HCoV or induced virus.
Instead, if the new HCoV enters the middle tomb right before or around the time of the input virus to humans, the virus is not yet adapted with new inches and often patogenic characteristics.
It can function as a source of human infection zoonotics and play as a amplification memory, allowing virus to be temporarily applied, and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCoV can experience infections in the case it is unable to maintain its transmission in intermediate memory.
Instead, HCoV can be adapted with intermediate memories and even cause long - term endemics.
In this case, the midst of the midst became a memory of natural reservation.
Epideological data retrospectively reveal that the case of NULL SARS has contacts with animals.
The following survey of seroprevalence indicates that the animal sales had higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than public population.
The moon (Paguma larvata) and the dogs in the live animal market are the first time they have been identified with a virus similar to SARS-CoV that is identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that there is no more case of SARS reported since all the enemies in the market were killed.
Instead, it was reported that a monthly enemy of the nature or an injury that is not assigned to the life market of the animal is most members of the results of the negative test for SARS-CoV. This suggests that the month's enemies may only be acted as an intermediate amplification, but not a natural resort to SARS-CoV.
It is necessary to note, because 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be concluded that many small species of animals may also function as a memory of SARS-CoV amplification.
All these inches seem to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The search of natural animals for SARS-CoV further reveals a closely friendly cov, named CoV from the Rhinolopus SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located on the top of the Tiongkok horse.
This carrier members the positive tests for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and followed by SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This CoV and other covs shared the nucleotide homologation by 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This is a foundation for the new concept that the deception is a memory of new human patterns.
Some CoV similar to SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the crash, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as living virus.
The enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ACE2) change is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 originating from the fashion sample is shown using ACE2 insults, enemies, and humans as receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the SARS-summers can control WIV.
Since this time, WIV1 has embraced the most closely associated with SARS-CoV in the middle, with a nucleotic type of 95%.
Despite its higher homologation between these two viruses, generally it was believed that WIV1 was not directly induced by SARS-CoV and the inflammation was not in the memory of direct SARS-CoV reservation.
The philosophic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same cover as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 swimming and MERS-CoV uses the same receptor, is also peptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a virus inside.
According to the RNA polymerase-RNA MERS-CoV philisticly closer to its headquarters in the beta-CoV identified by Europe and Africa.
Until now, there's no MERS-CoV lives found in the bullet.
MERS-CoV and his nearest family CoV-HKU25 was only shared by 87% of the nucleotic homologation.
That's why, the craft may not be the memory of MERS-CoV direct reservation.
On the other hand, study in the Middle East shows that the Arabic units have a zero-member result for specific antibodies that represent MERS-CoV, the same as the Mediterranean origin in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the arabic inhabitants. This indicates more than that the unta is the real reserve for MERS-CoV.
The important thing is also noted that massive virus exhibition with signs that usually seem to be seen in the tests infected with MERS-CoV.
It is necessary to note that the infectioned wheat wash the virus not only through the inflammation path, but also through the phecal-oral path, which is also the main path of the virus exhibition from the inflammation.
However, the question is still not answered because many MRS cases are confined have no contact reports before signs, probably because of human-human transmission or non-known transmission paths that include unknown species of animals that bring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 divides 96.2% of nucleotic homologia with CoV isolated from Rhinolophus finis.
Like in cases SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too big to set an induced relationship.
In other words, the screen may not be in the memory of the reservation directly SARS-CoV-2, except if CoV is found identical flavor in the next day.
There is probably a number of species of animals between SARS-CoV-2 which are sold and killed in the Gross Sea Food Market. Many cases of COVID-19 are scared with this market, which indicates the probability of transmission of animals.
Some recent studies based on the metagenological sequence indicate that a small-scale-scale-scale, known as trenggiling (javanica Manis), may also be brought to beta-CoV that is associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new CoV trendgenom shares 85-92% of nuclear-covry homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV was close to RATG13 with a comparison of 90% at the nucleotic sequence.
Both were moved into two subgars of virus like SARS-CoV-2 in the philytical tree, one part of the receptor (RBD) domain that is more like SARS-CoV-2, with a comparison of the amino acid as 97.4%.
What's happening, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are farther different, despite the total higher approval rates.
Earlier at the painful trends also reported the contingency virus detection from the powder sample, which also appeared to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This adjusts different methods of discharge and I think manually to produce sequences by parsial consisting of approximately 86.3% through a lock virus.
We can't overcome the probability of trends as one of the animals of the SARS-CoV-2.
However, now there are no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from trends because the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-sars-CoV-2 is called.
Furthermore, the range between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the range between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-sars-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary road is still to be set.
Although the highest highest types of the RBD were found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV families-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest types at the entire trip.
It's too speculated if it's said that it's the height of the range between the RBD beta-CoV families-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling and SARS-CoV-2 is moved by the convergence evolution its selective activity.
The hypothesis of indication supports recombination between beta-CoV-sars-CoV-2 staff trenggiling and RATG13 in third animal species.
As the evolution movement factor, the recombination of many occurred between the beta-CoV.
Researchers are still unable to decide about the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to a very patogenic HCoV, the HCoV-229E zoonotic, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been completed.
The philosophic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be originated from CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in research animals.
It was reported that the CoV-subject named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian RiCoV) detected at the top of three North American colors shows a closeness with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was geneticly associated with other covs, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also claimed to be a memory of his intermediate memory.
In order to make it clearer, the current knowledge of the origin of HCoV animals that are known are recorded in table 1 and Table 2.
The philosophic analysis has given evidence of transmission of HCoV interspections in history.
In approximately 1890, when HCOV-OC43 broke species of animals to infect humans, it was noted that there was a pandemic infection.
The HCoV-229E transmission history of an interspection is not too clear.
The alpha-CoV-flows associated with HCoV-229E have been found.
Among the two, there's a alpha-CoV alpha.
Some evidence supported the transmission of virus directly from humans.
First, humans, not alphacs, may have been contacted with the ecological relief.
Instead, humans have a contact with alpaks.
Second, the alpha-CoV-related drugs with HCoV-229E have a variety of and non-patogenic species in the disorders, while the alpha-CoV alpaka causes a disease of infection in animals infected.
Lastly, the alpha-CoV alpha wasn't found in the feral animals.
That's why the alpha can't be obtained by the HCoV-229E friends from humans.
In fact, it was a source of human patogenic virus, which included rabbis, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
That is why it is not too surprising that it is possible to directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Other probabilities, while the alpha-CoV is functioning as a gene HCoV-229E lungs, the alpaks and the Arabs may function as an intermediate memory that transmits virus to humans, precisely as the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for transmission of anti-species from the swimming to the Arab and from the Arabs to the human.
Evolutioner MERS-CoV from the survey is known at the first virus identification and also strengthened by finding afterwards.
Clearly, the bullet is a powder of rich virus species for genetic interspections and transmission of interspections.
The long age, the colonies of the race, the age of social interactions, and the strongest attitudes, all are the conditions supported for the blast to become the ideal virus preacher.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entered into the Arab village for decades.
This virus has been adapted to a wheel that has changed from the middle to a stable and natural reserve.
MERS-CoV causes very low diseases and maintains relatively low mutations in this animal.
His spondical transmission to humans occurs randomly and humans remain the end of MERS-CoV because its transmission couldn't be surprised.
Not as the main role in the MERS-CoV transmission, the trenggling role, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In addition, beta-CoV trenggiling is very patogenic in trends.
The engineering may be the end of the beta-CoV friend SARS-CoV-2, like an enemy in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some probabilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 anti-species from animals to humans must be calculated or decreased.
First, the cluster could be a reserve for the SARS-CoV-2 friendly virus that is identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological reliefs by sharing a new rock.
Second, trends could be one of the intermediate amplification memories for the SARS-CoV-2 newly entered staff virus.
Humans have a virus through the purchase and consumption of birds.
Maybe, many males, which include animals, are rate against SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody survey against animals and animals needs to be inside.
Three, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that are well contacted with the swimming and training.
Survey of the SARS-CoV-2 origin is still running.
Despite various species of animal wine, three main factors of the virus side are also important to distort CoV in the loss of species.
First, its relatively high mutation in the RNA replication.
Compared to another unified RNA virus, the CoV mutation view could be considered "ground" until "height" by the replacement of a large degree of ~10-4 per year per hour, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new inch.
CoV has exoribonuclease correction, elimination that causes very high, attempt, or even invisible mutability.
Interestingly, the nucleotid analogy is known to press CoV replication through this exoribuclease inhibition and RNA polymerase.
Desivir is one of the most promised anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, CoV mutation is about a million times higher than its inner mutation.
Moreover, it is often high when CoV has not yet been adapted to the incense.
Rather than SARS-CoV that has high mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, enlarge the higher adaptation rates with humans.
Probably SARS-CoV-2 has been adapted to another inch that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also happens to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to the Arab wall.
In theoretically, small probability that genetic inhibition would quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, through a large RNA in CoV, extra flexibility in the change of genoms, for mutation and recombination, increased the probability of co-evolution of anti-evolution, which encouraged it to appear to the new CoV at the appropriate condition.
This is supported by most of the unique reading and the protein function that is extended to the end of 3′ genom.
Three, CoV waste moved along the RNA replication through the unique "elect-salin" mechanism.
In a wall that works as a coverage, a warm injury occurred during the RNA CoV transcription.
A very homologous RNA can experience recombination to create a new CoV.
Natural recombinations have been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
Interactions with virus in its relationship with transmission
Furthermore, three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction with inch receptor is another main factor that affects the transmission of interspections.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered as a special example, which also shows a positive selection evidence during the transmission of interspections.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolation and enemy, SARS-CoV was expected to have rapid adaptation in various money, especially with mutation on RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptor and intensively become the target of the antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD was amino acid to 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, combined with ACE2 humans and its coreseptors as the inside virus road.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptor of various animals, which include the wounds, the enemy, the tissue, and the associated dogs, so that it allows transmission of anti-species virus.
In fact, only six amino residues, which were observed differently between human virus isolates and enemies in RBD and 4 are placed in the recipients for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV hate K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the interactions of protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for the adjustment of virus to humans.
It is necessary to note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at S1 protein S has been interfering with ACE2 human protein efficiency.
Even, a croo-EM study shows the human efficiency of the ACE2 and protein S SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SSARS-CoV protein.
It is also important to know whether there is another coreceptor that may be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
The interesting thing, HCoV-NL63 also appears with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-terasetilation for HCoV-OC43.
These receptor-receptors may also play in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after transmission of anti-species from its animal wheat.
In addition to cell receptor, the end of the HCoV transmission of anti-species is also set by other inflammation factors.
The differences between humans and natural reserve, such as bullets, Arabs, and intellectual animals, can be a risk of transmission of interspections.
HCoV needs to take the factors of myth dependency and bobol mysterious exposure factors in order to succeed in the transmission of interspections.
In this case, the molecular definition in the interaction of these important viruses must still be identified and said.
The entire genom recorder is unusual to see the SARS-CoV-2 dependence factors and delegations using CRISPR may be beneficial.
New HCoV: back to the beginning of the west.
CoV's distress has a great chance to show it a new HCoV.
In this case, the covs worked as a HCoV gene palmsheet.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination moved HCoV evolution and worked as two important steps in this process.
For example, increasing or losing genes of new proteins, the potential is to drasticly modify the phenotipe of virus.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was expected to be important in adaptation to humans because the SARS-CoV virus was found isolated by ORF8.
SARS-CoV with the meaning of 29 nucleotides was found in a stranger isolated at the beginning of human epidemies.
This removal separates ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be adaptive mutations supporting memory.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the line of Alpha-CoV and CoV, with a larger number of smaller recombinations in the RNA polymerase RNA depending on RNA.
Recombination sites are also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10, and most of the nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination between various lines of generations was moved to the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in the Arab Arab Arabian Arab.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination has also been observed in the HCoV other place where HCoV has experienced recombination with other animals in its non-structural gene.
It must also be observed that the building election can be involved in unconscious changes in the virus through, probably caused by the freedom of virus from the experienced selection pressure, such as the memory immune system.
The example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 in HCoV-229E prototypes due to the deletion of two nucleotics.
While the ORF4 extent can be seen by a fluid virus associated with HCoV-229E, alfa-CoV alpaka shows a single nucleotide residue that results in the loops.
Lastly, the HCoV evolution was also moved by the selective pressure in its reserve.
The signals are detected when CoV is infected, which indicate the adjustment between CoV and the inflammation.
It seems to be anatomically and physiologically adapted with CoV.
For example, the inflammatory response activity on the inflammation will be effectively reduced by the patology of CoV.
Furthermore, natural murder cell activity was pressed because the receptor cells were regulated by the NKG2/CD94 natural murderer and was expressed by the complex molecular histocompatibility of the primary I class.
Furthermore, the high reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high-scale metabolic activity can affect the CoV replication and affect the correction by exoribonuclease so that the selective pressure for a very patogenic virus system can be reduced when it comes into the new cord.
Strain CoV, which is more patogenic, may also develop through recombinations, which cause proteins or new protein plants to adapt to the breast.
That is why, not the case that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two wars.
CoV is a nonpatogenic character or causes a severe sign in its records, such as a flash and a wheat.
CoV applies strongly without taking the response of powerful memories.
There is a secret that has no signs and causes of severe human infections.
Weighty signs are mainly due to excessive immune responses and sitokins, increasing injury of the weight of the potential response.
On the contrary, in no sign, the immune response has been released from the CoV replication.
The same thing is to decide immune responsibilities may benefit from the anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The response of the interferon is mainly strong in the light.
That's why the interferon type I, at least at the beginning phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should be beneficial.
Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammation is defective.
With this reason, NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may benefit from the COVID-19 operation.
SARS-CoV-2 was followed by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the beta-CoV hedge that divides 95% of nucleotics with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also CoV hedges that divide 96% of nucleotide stems with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the enemy and other animals in that market were found to bring the same virus with SARS-CoV, the internal record for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found yet.
Beta-CoV trenggiling very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that trends may play as one of the intermediates or beta-CoVs may be member of the gen fragmen contribution at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 version.
Although still asked, there's no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by good humans in the way or in the way.
CoV returns to the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 newly.
CoVs in the cattle and other animals have changed very much our consciousness of the importance of the zootic origin and the preservation of animals for HCoV in human transmissions.
Very many evidence show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from the sword and transmitted to humans through the middle.
Remembering that SARS-CoV infection is from contacts between humans and enemies on the basic market, maybe the middle of the basic market and killing of all the enemies in it who effectively end SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trendling should be moved from the basic market to prevent zoo transmission, remembering that there were some beta-CoV seed lines that were closely associated with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and the mechanism SARS-CoV-2 were transmitted to humans through trends and other mathematics must still be declared in the future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was a long time in the Arab village.
This unit works as an important transport tool and is the main source of meat, fat, skin, and wild products for local society.
The Arab unity was spread in the middle of the East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the monsters to control MERS, like on the wild animal market in Tiongkok to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS, comprehensive approaches must be in place to develop vaccine for efficient furniture against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we have lost this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause a race.
A number of psychotic CoVs running in the middle.
In particular, CoV is a genuine psychotic potential.
There are many possibilities for this Zonotic CoV to develop and experience recombination, which causes new CoV to appear more easier and/or more easier for humans in the future.
Cultural eating animals in some places in Tiongkok must be left to decrease the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and planning should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since times.
These viruses are in its natural reservation until there is an opportunity to preach.
Despite the insult, many of the virus preachers have been supported, human opportunities can be contacted with the disorders and other natural species if a person is educated to avoid the animals.
The surveillance of survey against mamalia needs to understand CoV ecology and its natural memory, which will be beneficial in preventing the transmission of humans and the coming animals.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus zoonosis is that humans need to keep along with the ecological relief reserve natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the SARS-CoV-2 origin are not yet found.
First of all, if the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2-virus to the trends, the condition when the disorder and trends divide the environmental relief is the important thing to be known.
Second, if a person is directer in transmission to humans, man’s way of contact with the illness must be determined.
Third, if there is a third of the most important inhabitants, the way of interacting with other species, which include humans, insights, and training, should be explained.
Finally, because of many farmers, including animals that may be interested in SARS-CoV-2, good test infection and survey should be found.
I don't know the crazy, trends, or other mathematicians, expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its identical inductor virus can be identified in its natural memory at the coming time.
A surprise research in this area will evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary road in animals, with important implications in prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
COVID-19 is required for "configured cases" and "configured cases"
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice for diagnosis and control of new coronavir infections 2019 (2019-nCoV), which based our experiences and became a good reference to the world’s pandemics.
However, coronavir illness 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our conscience and knowledge increasingly increasingly based on clinical and practical experiences; therefore, the diagnostic and attack strategy also continues to be found.
In this letter, we answered one comment in our heading and set up the new criteria for "configured cases" and "configured cases" based on diagnosis and action for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the Commission for National Health of the People's Republic of Tiongkok.
In December 2019, new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus has caused an inflammation, which is currently formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and is given the name of the coronavirus syndrome of acute inflammation 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid advice and the advice was published at Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
It has been very interested in the event since it was published.
However, it is necessary to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and awareness of our growth on the basis of the discounts that continue and practical experience; therefore, the diagnostic strategy and an attack are also being carried out.
As an example of diagnosis and action for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Republic of Tiongkok (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has exposed the total of seven issues with a number of contexts.
Our comments received from Zhou et al., they reported a simple score proposal based on their clinical experiences.
The results of their work have made new evidence for our assignments and have become a precious role for this pandemic worldwide.
We supported the results of their significant work and expressed our appreciation.
However, the results of their work also needed a statement based on diagnosis and action for the latest COVID-19 (seven test tests) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a combination of one of the epidemiological reports with two clinical manifestations is required to make a comprehensive analysis, or a clinical performance of three manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological revision:
Epideological records: (1) the journey or residue in Wuhan and its area, or another community where the case of COVID-19 has been reported within 14 days before the signs; (2) the contact review with the case of SARS-CoV-2 (with the positive test); (3) contact review with the patient who experiences a divorce or signs of the destruction of Wuhan and its area, or another community where the COVID-19 case has been reported within 14 days before the edition; (4) contact report with the class of cases configured (≥ 2 cases with seven and/or signs of destruction within 2 weeks in the small area, such as house, office, school, dll).
Clinical demonstration: (1) low and/or flavouring signals; (2) COVID-19 infection inflammation plant; (3) total white cells indicate the normal limfosis, below, or reduced at the initial stage of the newspaper.
The diagnosis of the configured case should be based on the due case with one of the following patogenic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire sequence of the virus shows high homogenity for new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM-specific antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or the IgG-specific-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of the negative are positive, or the titer increases ≥4 in the phase of recovery above in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR tests in the sample of inflammation or blood in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Patogenic detections in the blood sample were produced in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and five (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was seventh edition.
This amendment based on a surprising investigation of researchers to search for optimal nuclear asset detection for quick diagnosis, and the samples of the inflammation of blood carcinogens, which increase the provisions of various species, and support certain positive antibodies results in the configured criteria.
Furthermore, there are more evidence that reminds us of being guarded by a personal sign and without a sign.
That's why the Zhou alir has to be found because they classify people without clinical signs as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practices and clinical studies in the future.
As a closure, we hoped that evidence would appear directly and ask for comments.
For the diagnosis of "configured cases" and "configured cases", we recommend to follow and obey the latest orders in each country.
Our team will also adjust our hard work as a helper.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest daily death.
Yesterday, Bangladesh put five new deaths on COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death force in one day of the consequences of the virus.
To yesterday, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of infections recorded in 114 active cases and 33 health cases in the house.
It's a total of 17 deaths.
In a sweet news, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death to the end of four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two age cases over 60 years, two cases between 51 and 60 years, and one case between 41-50 years.
He also said two sacrifices from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
An hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Commission Anti-Coruption of Bengali, who was addressed in the Kuwait Maitree hospital.
On the Sabbath, in a road video announcement, Obaidul Quader said that the public transport would be stopped longer than it was planned until the Sabbath arrives.
This public transport manager has started since March 26, and has been planned to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of items needed -- medical, burning, and disorders -- still allowed.
The first incidence of the COVID-19 infection recorded in Bangladesh was on 8 March, two new people who came home from Italy and also a wife of them.
On March 19, the three were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million people worldwide
On the Day of Cames, the total number of cases of infection of SARRS-CoV-2 coronary virus through one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 thousand deaths are scared with COVID-19, diseases caused by corona virus.
At the same time, Malawi had developed its first coron virus infection and Zambia had experienced the first death of the coron virus.
The North Korea claimed, on the day of Western, that the country was one of the few countries who remained free from the coronal virus infection.
To yesterday, World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1.05.635 cases, including 79.332 cases within twenty-four hours since 10 hours of the World Health Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there are more than 244 000 cases of corona virus, which caused at least 5.900 deaths.
The CBS news office reported, which recorded Johns Hopkins, has more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by corona virus infection.
Throughout the world, the countries announce a more urgent action to affect disease preachers.
On the day of Kamis, Sergei Sobyanin, Moskow Value, extended the quarters of the territory to 1 May.
As a national, president Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens will continue to be paid without having to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament made a voice campaign to extend the status of the national statement for 15 days; the voice movement was released with 215 voices, ten abstained voices, and one voice denied.
Saudi Arabs spent a hour of evening in the sanctuary of Mekkah and Madinah until the whole day; before, the evening was only between the 3th and the 6th morning.
Thailand’s plan applied the night hour between 10 and 4 morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country has extended the order to live at home until May 1th.
Too-to-do decreases the limits of toilet pressure for transactions
On Sunday and Sabtu evening, the Wol and Coles' nets each set down the border of the toilet pressure to two and one transaction pair at all stakeholders at the national destination.
ALDI also applied the border of one master on the last day.
This limitation is announced as a message in the casier and on the Facebook web page.
The sales reported that the provisions of COVID-19's fear should be made by the community's isolation.
On the day of Rabu, Wool ́ths also limited the toilet tissue to the house to one boss per message.
This change followed the four heads of transactions previously applied to Wool’ths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In its media statement on 8 March, Coles reported that with the four men's statement, "the majority of the staff are still in a hour since the scientists," and called that request "before ever happened," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on the sunday, called it "no conscious".
The sale of the "speak" a week ago, thinks a joke talks about Wool's.
Toko Costco in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two weeks ago.
In order to avoid disturbance, Coles had greater difficulties than the owner and increased the frequency of employment, Wool ́ths had a greater provision, while ALDI had prepared for the promotion of the Rab.
Zimmerman, the Executive Director of Peritel Association, says that the journal tries to increase the provisions, but the limits of the local government for the time of the truck training make it difficult.
He was focused on the production payments, the engineers tried to comply with the requests, and a smaller promotion.
On the Sunday, ALDI announced that some of the tasks were not able to be taken by the Lamb.
In a report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a recorder from Queensland ́ of Technology, says that the subject is to finish all night's arrangements.
He claimed that the toilet tissue was a large volume of things so that the number of its provisions was low and, if it was sold, made a lot of spaces in the roof so that the overcome of things was more felt.
Coles and Wool seem to [that] if there are many things in the race, if the product such as toilet pressure and service can [dibuli] and there are in a large number, when it may be minimised, the Russel Zimmerman test through the ABC News Office.
The manufacturer of the recycling toilet toilet, Who Gives a Crap, said that they were insured in the last day of the Rabb.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, pressed them to work 24/7 to care for the army, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real state, reported that some property sales offer free toilet tissues to the first holiday offerer in Melbourne, when a little bit more delayed because they took a breakfast for the long end of the Bird Day.
The NT News Edition, a day published in Darwin, provides eight pages of the pages that were intended to be cut and used as a toilet tissue.
Toko-toko actually doesn't apply the limits, according to the ABC report on 3 March, they say they're not planning to apply the level of education.
Zimmerman suggested that other products were also in high requests, including mask, service, dry waters, hands and tissues.
Similarly, on the Sunday Sunday, Ocado’s supermarket district was limited to Andres’ toilet tissue to two of the tops of 12 July.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as pandemic
On the Day of Rab, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is happening -- illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 – as pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" only refers to how much disease has been spread, not how dangerous that case, the WHO reports the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries are still able to change this pandemic travel.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and moves its people as response, the Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very excited because the preaching work and the distress that are concerned or because of anxiety.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the director of the Centre of Control and United States Sickness, this pandemic "never happened before".
He said, in a report published by the CNN in February, "except influenza, there is no virus of inflammation that has ever been removed from its movement to a surprising global preaching."
Ghebreyesus explained the same view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemia that was thought by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the time together."
In January, the new status was followed by the WHO’s decision, which stated that this was a part of the world’s welfare of health.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the American District, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this question, "They're angry, it'll be worse."
Until Kamis, Press reported at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which caused more than 4.600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemy 2019-2020 is the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemy which is continued and caused by coronavirus acute disorder syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The League was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019, as a Department of the Health of the World on January 30, 2020, and was expressed as a pandemian on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial regions, which caused about 97.000 deaths.
About 364.000 people have been healed.
The case fatality was considered 4% in Tiongkok, while worldwide begins from 13,04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The signs of the community were thrown down, rocks, and a sudden pressure.
Complication can affect pneumonia and acute inflammation syndrome.
Since the signs were burned up to the most commonly about five days, it was possible to start from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment yet.
The main survey is symptomatic and supportive therapy. It is recommended that preventive actions take hands, shut down the mouth on the rock, keep the distance from others, and count the isolation of the illness for those who are expected to be infected.
The authorities worldwide have been responsible with members of the traveling limits, karantine, evening, workshop controls, and difficulty arrangements.
This pandemy has caused heavy global economy disorders, cultural, political, religious, religious, and largely disturbance of panic-panic-related materials.
School and university have been closed well at the national and local stage in 193 countries, which affected around 99.4 per cent of the worldwide students.
The information about this virus has spread the blood and there are incidences of xenofobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people with the seed and appearance of East Asia and the Netherlands, and those coming from the area with a significant virus case.
As a result of traveling and heavy industrial units, air and carbon pols are down.
Health Authority in Wuhan, Tiongkok (subject of Hubei’s propriation), reported a class of pneumonia cases not known on December 31, 2019 and studied at beginning January 2020.
These cases are most of the worst with the Great Sea Food Market and that is why the virus was deemed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the raw is called SARS-CoV-2, the new virus found and associated with the coronavirus, the coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with the signs then known as a sickness on December 1, 2019, and that person has no clear conviction with the class of the basic markets mentioned later.
Among the early case classers reported in December 2019, two-thirds have a relationship with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case that could be issued on 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old of the Hubei province, was likely the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tiongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the new case outside Tiongkok had passed through the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
Perhaps there are a number of cases that are not reported, especially among those who have more signs.
By 26 February, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19 years of age, represented 2,4% of the case worldwide.
The case recalls the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and who have been tested have been configured positively according to the statistical protocol.
Until 23 March, there is no country testing more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made a political policy to avoid testing people with raw signs, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumentated infection was a source of infection for 79% documentated cases.
An analysis published on 30 March suggested that the infection engine in Italy was considered greater than the case reported.
The beginning of the basic reproduction device (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Governing Body and the American Sickness Centre concluded that it was probably 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 reports are healing.
For those who are unhealthy, since signs have been developed to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been scared with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, until 5 February, approximately 80% of the death occurred in age of 60 and 75% have a previous health disorder, which affects cardiovascular and diabetes diseases.
The fatality that actually caused COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the potential of the professionals does not determine the dead without testing, for example, at home, in the house of care, dsb.
Parsial data from Italy found that the number of mortal units is more than 4-5 times along with the counting of COVID's original death.
A young woman speaks to the Centre of Control and illness (CDC) of the United States admits: "We know [the number of dead announced] is lower than the real wheel," a statement strengthened by an unexpected report on counting too low in the United States. The too low number appears in the pandemics, such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009. The first death is constructed in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside Tiongkok was held on 1 February in Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside the Tiongkok, more than a thousand deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territorial regions have reported death in the benua, except the Antarctic, and in general, some exhibitions are used to calculate mortality.
This is based on areas and time, and affected by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, the options, the time of age, the nature of population, the species of age, and the whole health.
According to Johns Hopkins, the death ratio against the case globally was 6.0% (97.039/日617.204) on 10 April 2020.
This is the case of the area.
In Tiongkok, the death ratio in cases falls from 17,3% (e.g. persons with the signal report of 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (e.g. people with signic reports after 1 February 2020). Other hypoglycaemia affects case fatality (CFR), which indicates the percentage of the mortal diagnostics resulting from certain diseases, and the IFR fatality, which indicates the percentage of infections (there diagnosis and non-diagnosis) that died from certain diseases.
These statistics haven't been timeful and followed by certain populations begin from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these elements for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicines of Oxford provides an infection fatality unit for pandemics at all between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The border of this opinion is based on the result of the first COVID-19 test in Germany and an analysis of the impact of the test on CFR thinking.
WHO states that this pandemic can be controlled.
The end of this race is not clear and may be different according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State said, "Nothing has been controlled, it's usually deteriorated and then started to get down when the illness is available.
But it is not possible to make a mental project at this time about when it happens."
The senior medical adviser of the Government Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan believed that "they might end June" if the whole country could be moved to follow the WHO's advice on steps to stop the virus preachment.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to run, probably for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research that Neil Ferguson has introduced, physical statements and other steps will be needed "to the vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt said, "I think I think that this coronavirus, because it is very easy to be transmised, can lose all of it" and "the disease may change to musical disease, which comes back to the year."
Increasing viruses will depend on the depths and mutations.
COVID-19 signs can be relatively unspecific and those infected can be without signs.
Two of the most common signs (88%) and dry rocks (68%).
The signs that I have forbidden to overcome the weakness, the production of the dilution (flegma), the loss of the swimming, the snake, the snake, the nerve, the nerve, the nerve, the head’s pain, the heoptic, the hemoptics, the diarrhoea, or the lensis.
The U.S. Center of Control and Sickness (CDC) shows the signals of the urgency to face, pressure or breast-feeding, disturbance, travel, and distress on faces and bibirs; medical attention is recommended as soon as these signs appear. More diseases can be distressed, syndrome of acute, sepsis, sectic son, and death.
Some who are infected may be asymptotic, certainly without clinical signs, but with the results of tests that enhance infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confined to infection should be strong and tested to be uninfected.
The people of Tionghoa were appealing to a race of empathy from some to 44 percent.
Incubasis periods (when between infections and signs) usually declined between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, inconfidence, the number of COVID-19-reviews lost 30% and descended to 15%.
The principles of this illness are still split.
The COVID-19 preach is primarily reported at a close contact and through a small droppet that is produced when rocks, spins, or speaks; nearby contact is a contact between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The research found that uncovered rocks can cause the droppet to be low by 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some virus investigators may also be exported by a small droppet that endures longer in the air and is produced when talking. The droplet can also be achieved when smoking, including when talking, although this virus is not generally exported through the air.
Droplet can fall in a mouth or a person who is near it or may be thrown into the pockets.
Some medical procedures, such as intubacy and heart intensity (RJP), can make the secret of the inflammation changes to the insult, and they are spread through the air.
The preaching can also happen when a person touchs a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, the mouth, and the mouth.
Although there is anxiety that the virus can spread through fees, the risk is low.
The Government of Tiongkok presents the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 orally.Virus is the most successful in the first three days after the signal report, although the preaching may occur before signs of appearance and at the next stage of diseases.
The results of the positive tests may occur until three days before the signature, which provides transmission may occur before there are significant signs.
Only a few cases of asenso have been configured by kolium, but the async output has been identified by some countries during the investigation of contact research.
The Centre of Europe’s Sickness and Control (ECDC) states that although this disease is not clearly clear how easy this disease is, one generally infected two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected until three days on plastic (polypropylen) and 304, one day on card, and more than four hours on the board.
However, this results depending on weakness and weakness, and other animals and animals have been tested by the COVID-19 positive.
There is no evidence that animals can put virus on humans, although the British authority suggests to cut hands after contact with animals, such as after contacting with the surface that may have been touched by infected people.
Coronavirus is a new virus, the first time is isolated from three pneumonia agents who are scared with a claster of acute disorder disease in Wuhan.
All SARS-CoV-2 viruses are newly scared with coronavirus in the nature. Inside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if the households are broken, which cause its protective amplops. SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the first SARS-CoV.
Virus was considered to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is geneticly classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in Sarbecovirus subgenus (sheet B) together with two deceases.
This virus has 96% equality in the whole crown through another coronavirus pattern (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Tionghoa researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid in certain parts, accordingly, between human relief viruses and human viruses.
Until now, the whole comparison by the most of the 92% of the genetic equality between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the relief is a SARS-CoV-2 middle.
Infections by virus can be diagnosed while based on signs, but finally confusions are been diagnosed by reactions of reverse polymerase transcription (rRT-PCR) to the secret infected or through the CT detection.
One research compared to PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but I have specifically, with many of the medical figures that move with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology admitted that "CT cannot be used to write or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has issued a number of RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first launched on 17 January.
Tests using reactions to polymerase transcription back-time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be found in a model of bleeding or blood.
The general results are available within a few hours until a few days.
In general, this test is used at nasofaring, but it is also possible to use, and many  firs and companies are developing serological tests that identify antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, no one of the serological tests proved sufficiently accurate to accept its use.
In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been accepted for the use of waters, only by the uncertified kolium.
The characteristics of radiography and tomography is computed (CT) in persons who feel that it includes the opacity of the earth’s glass perifer, and there is no pleasure evasion.
The Italian Radiological Society is combining international area databases for findings of discovery in configured cases.
Since other infections such as adenovirus are moved, awareness without PCR conference has limited levels in the identification of COVID-19.
A large investigation in Tiongkok compares the results of the CT dada with the PCR and shows that, despite the specific infections, increasing and more sensitive consideration, it is recommended to be considered as a recording tool in the epidemic area.
The neural convolution network based on building intellectuality has been developed to identify virus designs with radiography and CT.
In order to prevent this disease’s outcome, it includes a good personal cleanness, cutting hands, avoiding touching the eyes, mouths, or mouths before taking the hands, and using the tissue when rocks or spins and directly cutting the tissue into the sample.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use a mask in the public.
It is also intended to prevent the outcome, and the governments in various areas have limited or encouraged to stop all non-sensitive travels from the country and regions.
However, the virus has reached the scale of the public in most of the world’s areas.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some community members don't know where or how they are infected.
The use of local data from the phone by the government for this purpose has caused private problems, with the outcome of Amnesty International statements and over 100 other organizations that represent such survey statements.
A number of mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be voluntaryly used, and on 7 April 2020, more than a thousand experts have made a large private solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the time of use to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who is tested positively for COVID-19.Remember the misunderstanding of how to prevent infection; for example, healing and injury with ineffective cumines.
There's no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Increasing his hands to prevent the illness preacher.
The CDC agrees that people are often cutting hands with a bath and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands appear to be crazy; before eating; and after buying the feed, the rocks, or the kitchen.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a destructive householder who destroyed its protector’s headquarters.
Furthermore, the CDC agreed on the use of basic alcohol service with less than 60% of alcohol based on volumes when weapons and waters are not available.
The WHO encourages people to not touch the eyes, the mouth, or the mouth before they cut their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated with a number of fluids (in one minute of markets is infected for the surface of stainless steel), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, hypochloride sodium 0.1%, peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2-7.5%.
Others, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconium chloride, are effective.
CDC agrees that if there is a case of COVID or configured in general fatality, such as office or child advice, all areas such as office, banquet room, public area, electronic equipment together as tablets, touch views, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the deputy must be disinfekted.
Medical health organizations are aware of how people can hide their mouths and breathes with a tissue that is stuck or used when rocks or kissing, and then quickly cut off the tissue.
The masker is combined with those who may have been infected because using the mask can limit the volume and the rate of the dropped exhibitors that are expired when speaking, singing, and stomach.
WHO has given the instructions on the time and way of mask clothing.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virological expert in Leeds, "Masker can reduce the incidence of people to touch their face with unclean hands, which is the main source of exhaustion."Masker was also recommended to be used by those who care for others who may have caused this disease.
WHO accepts the use of healthy people only if they risk high, like those who care about the COVID-19 news, although the WHO also admits that using the mask can help people to avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have started to encourage the use of the mask to the community members.
In the United States, the CDC comes to the use of the nonmedical face mask made from the cigarette. The tingkok specifically comes to the use of the medical mask once in the healthy society, especially when it is close to (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong remembered that the mask was covered by using public or living in many places.
Thailand’s health officers encouraged people to make a cake mask at home and cut it on the day.
The Republic of Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited their community to go out to the public without masking or hiding their mouths and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all his citizens to use the face mask when they went to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded a person who entered the tozerba to use the face mask.
Israel asked all his citizens to use the face mask when they were in the public.
Taiwan, who produced ten million masks per day since the middle of March, obliged the carrier and antarctic bus to make the face mask on 1 April.
The Panama forced the use of the face mask once out of the house, and reminded of the construction of its own face mask for those who could not sell a face mask.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, the face masker was also largely used.
Social restrictions (as well known as physical statements) are the actions of infection control that are intended to slow down the disease preaching by minimising contacts close to individuals.
Society methods affect karantine; traveling; school, job, station, theater, or district center.
People can apply social approaches by living at home, limiting traveling, avoiding many areas, using health without contact, and keeping physical distances from others.
Today, many governments are committed to social resources in a distant area.
The number of people gathered by the US governments and health organizations quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (if not known, there was a COVID-19 in the area) to be 50 people, and then 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited meetings in the public area that included more than two people. Age and medical conditions based on diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension, and immune systems that have a serious risk of disease and more complexity are recommended for CDCs to reduce physical contacts only in the area that has been affected by social relations. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health body began to move the use of the term "social interaction" to explain that its purpose is to reduce social contacts by continuing to maintain social, global or far-term.
The use of the term "social limits" includes that people have to isolate themselves totally socially and do not encourage people to remain in connection with others by alternative ways.
This recommendation includes an invitation to sexual relations only with people who live with you and have no virus or signs.
The isolation is located in the home for those who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are expected to be infected.
A number of governments have been binding or compromised by the Quarantine for all the populations in the areas that are affected.
The karantine instructions are the most urgently issued for people who include high risks.
Those who may be presented to the COVID-19 newspapers and those who recently passed to the country or area with the COVID-19 preacher, which is recommended to carantine the last 14 days of the market probably.
In the discipline, it is meditation, or suspicion, and mitigacy.
The divorce at the early stage and the purpose of tracking and isolating those infected and doing other steps to control infections and vaccination that are intended to stop the preachment of diseases to the whole population.
When it is impossible to discuss the disease preacher, the following effort is to go to the medical level: these steps are taken to slow the preaching and reduce its impact on health care systems and society.
Combination of objective and medical actions can be used at the same time.
Suppression needs more extreme steps to reverse pandemics by reducing the basic reproduction volume to be less than the 1st part of the dilution of illness is trying to decrease the epidemic point, known by the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of healthcare and provides more time for vaccine and medical development.
The non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with individual preventive actions, such as cleanness of hands, using face mask, and karantine; steps in the area of society intended for physical statement, such as closing the school and canceling the arrangement of mass meeting; public advice to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps in the environment, such as the purity of the surface.
Other countries also apply a number of steps to limit the virus preacher.
South Korea reported the local massal and karantine, and warned about the movement of infected ones.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who make sure that they have a large wall for those who fail to do it.
Increasing the production of the face mask and condemning medical provisions, the simulation for England and the United States shows that mitigacy (slowly, but not stop epidemic preaching) and supression (reverse epidemic growth) has great challenges.
The optimal medical policies can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still cause thousands of death and health systems.
The surprise can be selected, but it needs to be maintained while the virus is still running in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this first is reached), because if not, the shopping will quickly turn back when the supression steps are controlled.
A long intervention to press pandemics has a impact on social and economic impact.
There are no specific antivirus medicines that are accepted for COVID-19, but the development efforts are on, which include already existing medicine tests.
Following freely sold flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help to disturb signs.
Depending on the oxide, oxygen, intravenous inflammation, and inflammation support may be needed.
The use of steroids can hurt the condition of patients.
Some of the previously accepted treatment of other virus diseases are tied to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home negotiations" can make signs caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increased capacity and health services for the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in response to the response.
The ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office have carried out the case for hospitals and health services in the first place in order to enhance the resources in various directions, including focusing the service for COVID-19, if it allows to cancel the electrical process, separate and isolate the positive COVID-19 patients, and enhance intensive care capacity by training and enhance the number of ventilators and beds.
There are many theories about the first case (which is called zero patients).
The first known case of coronavirus can be identified on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are most terrified by the Great Sea Food Market, who also sold animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, the virus had zoonotic origin. A class of pneumonia with a reason not known on December 26, and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the Hubei Province’s Hospital, which members of the CDC Jiang Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a doctor in the Hospital Center Wuhan members knew their companions about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police because they broke decades of false, and others, Ai Fen, were determined by him because of the warning he was released.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then delivered public publications on December 31 and told the WHO members.
A number of pneumonian cases are not known to the health authority in Wuhan that then conducted an investigation at the beginning of January.
In the beginning and middle of January 2020, the virus was spread to other provinces of Tiongkok, supported by the new Year and because Wuhan was the central transport centre and the main fire trading.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported 140 new cases each day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following research indicates that 6 174 people have experienced signs on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States have passed Tiongkok and Italy with the highest cases worldwide. To 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
As a pandemian in Europe, many countries in the Schengen village have limited free movement and control.
The national views followed the steps of resolve, such as karantine (which is known as the order of residence in the house, the orders protected in the area, or in the area) and evening. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are in the department of the United States, more than 50 million people were carantined in the Philippines, about 59 million people were carantined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were carantined in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people worldwide were in the areas of quarantine, which increased to 2,6 billion people two days later, as the world’s population.
The first COVID-19 case could be re-configured to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one not yet configured report shows the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed the class of pneumonia’s cases with unrecognized cause on December 26, which was announced to the CDC Jianghan’s hospital on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, the initial genetic test of the patient was reduced by coronavirus like SARS.
An invitation to the public by the Wuhan City Health Committee on December 31.
WHO was told on the same day.
When this knowledge was done, the doctor in Wuhan was warned by the police because "preaching the centuries" about that.
The Committee on the National Health of the People of Tiongkok first claimed that there was no "proof" of humans to humans.
At the end of January, the Government of Tiongkok put a radical campaign explained later by the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jin as a "population war" to deal with the virus preacher.
In the karantine called "greatest karantine in human history", the health cordon or cleanness was announced on 23 January to stop the inside and out of Wuhan, and increased to a total of 15 towns in Hubei, which affected about 57 million people.

In 24 of the 31 provincies, citizens, and Tiongkok regions, the authors were responsible for extending the new Year’s release to February 10th and ordering the majority of the jobs to not be opened back to that date.
These villages are 80% of the country's PDB and 90% of the export.
Hong Kong has increased the illness in the highest stage and announced the situation of the area, closed the school until March, and canceled the new Year’s festival.
The visit to the declers in Europe and Latin America was 40%.
North America and the Middle East experienced 50-60%.
This also causes 33-43 per cent of the seed and the feet travel to the Maret travel center compared to February.
The World Trade Centre Operators are a majority of steps, such as health inflammation, terminal insurance for checking the poverty, and awareness. According to the opinion of the PBB Economy Commission for Latin America, pandemic receptions can cause those who are in extreme poverty in Latin America, between 14 and 22 million people, compared to non-pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost work in Tiongkok.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost work and requested government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, coronavirus can cause the loss of 47 million work in the United States and the deficiencies can reach 32%. In India, the quarters of the India have caused hundreds of millions of workers (paid through the daily payment) to fail. Surveys from the Reid Institute found that 44% of the homes in Canada have experienced a type of loss of job. 900,000 workers in Spain have lost work since they have been completed in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of the month of March, four million French employees offered temporary deficiencies and 1 million British employees offered universal credit schemes. Hampir, half million companies in Germany, offered a work scheme for government subsidy to his employees, called Kurz Work.
The work scheme was adopted by French and English.
In the world, the culture’s sector and the culture’s inheritance are highly viewed by pandemics, which affect the operations of the organization and individuals, and that are well-inspected as well - being.
Arts and cultures are attempting to deal with their missions (who are often obtained) to give cultural inheritance access to society, to protect the security of workers and society, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, in the world and at different stages, museum, literature, showing place, and other cultures were closed without time, with the power, the practice, and its indications were cancelled or dismissed.
As a view, intensive efforts are made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The result of this new and very quickly developing disease is religious, big educational, and other social arrangements, such as music and concert festivals, conferences, and distress.
The film was also disappointed, and the Vatican announced that the Holy Holy Festival in Rome, which fell on the last week of the Christian repentance of Prapa, was canceled.
Many clergy encourage Christian elders to live home and not attend Misa on Sunday; some churches provide church service through radio, television directly or television, while others offer drivers or farms.
By concluding the church and the cape of the Roman Catholic Church, and the Holy Peter of the Christian historians, other religious bodies also rejected the ministry and restricted the public meetings in churches, masters, synagogues, dogs, and teachers.
The Iran Health Government announced the proofs of the Jumates in the area that appears to be a place of worship afterwards closed, while Saudi Arabs prohibited their foreign leaders and their people to the sacred places in Mekah and Madinah.
This pandemic causes the most significant disaster against the world’s natural calendar since World War II.
The majority of the major performances are cancelled or denied, including EUFA Champions 2019-2020, Premier Liga 2019-2020, EUFA Euro 2020, NBA 2019-2020, and NHL in 2019-2020.
The Olimpiade Musim 2020 plan, which was first settled, will begin on the end of July; the International Olimpiade Committee announced on 24 March that it would "rebuild up to 2020, but will not be more than the hot morning of 2021".In the world, the casino and other games were closed and directly released or cancelled.
This causes many individuals to move to the ground, many of the books report a significant new recording. The entertainment industry has also affected, by using various groups of music, or by canceling the concert tour.
Many big theaters like Broadway also spread all shows.
Arts explore various ways to continue to produce and share work through the Internet as an alternative to directly show directly, such as the direct cycle concentration or make "festival" bases for artists to display, broadcast, and publish their work.
Many of the Internet’s subjects of coronavirus have been distributed to blood with many people who walk to humor and care in the middle of uncertainty.
Since COVID-19, there was a prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the generations of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as those of the regions looking at Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidence of fear, furnishment, and disturbance is observed in many countries, mainly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific areas.
The report from February (when most of the cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records the racisms expressed in various groups worldwide that Tionghoa’s people deserved to receive virus or accept what they claimed as a corresponding price.
Some African countries have also experienced anti-Tiongkok sensations.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their origin.
There's support for the Tionghoa people, good tissue and remote, and for people in the area that looks like virus.
After the development of new hotspot countries, the Italian people, the first country in Europe who experienced a serious COVID-19, could also be a majority of clusters and xenophobia. Citizens in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first signed petitions to prohibit the Tionghoa people to stop diseases.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a train on Twitter.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in the United States of Raya and the United States reported racial and attacks.
President AS Donald Trump was criticized because he called Coronavirus "Virus Tiongkok", which critics considered racism and anti-Tiongkok.
Ukrainian guests attacked buses that brought Ukrainians and foreigners who were devacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, which are limited to Tiongkok, and learned in the large Indian cities, were reported by the worst disappointment of coronavirus.
President of the Bharatian Janata unit of the country in the West Dilip Ghosh states that Tiongkok has destroyed the nature and "it is why God recompenses them."
The statement was then addressed by the Tiongkok advice in Kolkata, called "heliru". In Tiongkok, xenofobia and racism against non-Tionghoa people were struck because of pandemics, with strangers were described as "foreigners" and were called to "release".
Many newspapers used by payment have removed them for some or all their coronaviral lips.
Many scientists have made the most dangerous scientists available with open access.
Some scientists decided to share their results quickly on a workshop server, such as bioRxiv.
New diagnostic diseases — new patogen infections, often newly in the disorders or the methods of infusion

Analysis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect virus existence and detect antibodies produced as response to infection.
There are viruses in a sample configured with RT-PCR, which detected RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at a time.
This test is used to enhance new or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
The antibody test shows the number of individuals that have been translated, including those who are signs too hard to report or without signs.
The accurate mortality of diseases and the inflammation of the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Since limited tests, until March 2020, no country has data on virus prevalence in its population yet.
By 23 March, there is no country testing more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variety in the number of tests that have been in the countries.
These variables may also affect the meaning of the case fatality reported, which may be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of the polymerase transcriptase back-time (rRT-PCR), this test can be found in a model of divergence that is obtained with various methods, including the use of nasofaring or sputum.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test that is at the top of the fire can only be reported in the first week of illness.
Then, the virus could disappear in the inflammation of the throat as it continues to be implemented in the woods.
As an alternative, for the infections tested in the second week, the samples can be taken from the rubber inside using the cateter of the sceptre or of the sceptum.
One of the early PCR tests were developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reverse reaction of polymerase transcripts (RRT-PCR), and at least 250,000 tests to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England Raya also developed a study on 23 January 2020.South Korean Company developed SARRS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
This ship looks for "E" that belongs to all coronavirus beta, and RdRp gene specific for SARS-CoV-2.In Tiongkok, BGI Group was one of the first companies that accepted the use of the national Medical Product Tiongkok for the SARS-CoV-2-based PCR detection tools. In Great America, the Centre of Control and Pension of disease (CDC) distributes the RT-PCR diagnostic Panel Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the health of society through the International Resource Reactor.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test tool provides unconscious results because of reacting errors, and the number of CDC tests in Atlanta is limited; this causes less than 100 samples per day to process throughout February 2020.
The use of two components was considered not to be determined until February 28, 2020, and immediately after that, the country’s parts and local provinces were allowed to be tested.
This test was approved by the United States Business Watchtower and Food Watchtower on the basis of the Duration Authorisation. The United States commercial laboratory began to study at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the COVID-19 test transmissions based on RT-PCR at national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 studies available nationally on 9 March 2020.
There is no quantity limit to be declared; the collection and species depreciation must be in accordance with the CDC provisions.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the Centre of Virology and BioVECTOR Rissets.
On 11 February 2020, this test was submitted by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics accepted the FDA tests that could be conducted at 3.5 hours of volume so that one machine could perform about 4.128 studies at 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation for the use of the aircraft (USA) to Abbott Laboratories to study the 2000 Abbott system; FDA had previously performed the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also accepted the EUA from the FDA for an examination of about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that uses the amplification of the non-PCR nuclear concentration.
Since it does not need a cyclic cycle, this method can give positive results only within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Now there are approximately 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott focused on increased production until 50,000 tests per day. The test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically carry out nucleocapsid proteins (N) new coronavirus is developed in Taiwan, hopefully can result in 15 to 20 minutes such as the rapid influenza test.
A literature published in March 2020 concluded that "foto toracs have small values at the first stage, while the CT [computated toography] findings may have been before signs."
Specific figures in the CT include the opacity of bilateral multi-ground-glass with perifer distribution, asymmetric, and later.
Subpleura domination, crazy paving, and consolidation are the same as the development of disease.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with the CT at this point of pandemics shows that the CT is more sensitive than PCR, although I decrease specifically, with many forms of tuberculosis inhibited with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology admitted that "CT cannot be used to write or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC accepted PCR for the first signature.
The part of immune response to infection is the definition of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections on individuals since approximately 7 days after signal reports, to determine immunity against disease, and in population survey.
Automatic system with high results in many clinical steroids will be able to do this examination, but its provision will depend on the level of production for systems.
For C’, one peripheral blood species are generally used, although some species can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, one species of peripheral blood is generally used through skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 parties that provide awareness to the agency as necessary and that now can distribute their antibodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test adopted by the FDA based on the authorization of the use of aircraft. On the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test tools that can identify IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in the blood sample.
The test capacity is until a few sample rates in a few hours, so far faster than the conventional PCR test against the virus RNA.
At the beginning of April, England Raya found that no antibodies testing tool was sold enough to be used.
Hong Kong sets a scheme for the patient to live in the house, "the department of the ships will give the patient species," they rejected it, sent it back, and received the results afterwards. The NHS England announced that NHS is pioneering the case scheme for the low cases in the house and losing the risks of patients to travel if they come to the hospital or have to infect ambulances if they are used. In COVID-19, a professional health teacher will take an example of the appropriate disturbance action.
On March 2, the National Security of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians German said that Germany had approximately 12.000 tests per day in the road service and 10.700 reviews had been held in the previous week.
The payment is charged by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19, the test was offered in some large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests in Germany is not known because only the positive results were reported.
One first investigation shows that at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) positively tested for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers in the Hospital Technion and Rambam have developed and tested the method of testing the sample of 64 patients together, connecting the samples and testing only more if a positive sample was found. In Wuhan, the detection of a duration is about 2,000 metres of the name "Huo-Yan" (mandarin: ®, or "Mata Appi" in Indonesia) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples.
By being monitored by BGI Wang Jian and eating for 5 days, the model shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the worst payment for the karantine attack could be double-handed if this test capacity does not exist.
Wuhan Laboratorium soon followed by Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Pejing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities in the whole Tiongkok.
On 4 March 2020, the total ability of its day is about 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays' multiplax design of open sources can test as well as 22 patterns for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This comparison can be passed in small chips without the need of robots.
Until Maret, the deficiencies and the number of insufficient reactions have become a massive test in the United States of Europe, England, and the United States.
For that reason, a number of researchers tried to explore the sample transmission protocol that includes the sample depreciation at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA for further studies. On March 31, the Arab Emirates Union reported to make more coronaviral examinations than any country, and prepare to increase the test scale to achieve the majority of the population.
This is accomplished through the combination of the planting and studies of the mass results of the population of groups 42 and BGI (based on the detection of the "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
In 14 days, this is able to do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and it is the first kolium that has this scale outside Tiongkok.
A number of recepts of studies that argued that various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts the German reception for the production of test tools sent to the countries with low relief without a source of power to develop themselves.
The German recept was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sickness Centre is not available until the 28 January, so that it late the studies available in the United States. In the beginning, Tiongkok and Serikat America are difficult with the signs of testing instruments; these two countries and they cannot provide sufficient tests to comply with the requests and recommendations of health research.
Instead, the scientist states that large testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the new coronavir preachment.
In some years, the South Korean Government, most of the majority of the primary sectors, has been released.
On March 16, the World Health Organization adopted the best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemics. A high request for testing because a major virus preacher causes thousands of trials to wait for the operation in the United States, and the preparation for the use and the chemical reactions.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported an accurate problem on their test tools.
In the United States, the CDC test tool has "macket"; the government then removes birocracy that prevents the investigation by Swesta. Spanish sold the test tool from the Tiongkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that it was not exact.
The company explains that the uncertain results may result from the failure of collecting the samples or using the test tools correctly.
The Spanish Emperor said that they would draw an injurious outcome, and move it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tool sold by the Republic of Czech from Tiongkok. Slovakia sold 1,2 million tests from Tiongkok.
The Prime Minister Matovič recommended that this test tool be removed to the Danube River. The Kara from the Turkish Health Center states that the Turkish test tool was sold from Tiongkok has "height error rates" and they did not "use it".In England, Raya sold 3,5 million tests from Tiongkok, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test tool was not used.
The trial, followed by the karantine of those who are tested positively and who are contacted with the SARS-CoV-2, is a positive end result.
Researchers working in Vó Italia, the first place of death in COVID-19 in Italy, performed two studies in the whole population of 3,400 people, with about 10 days.
About half of those who have been tested positively have no signs, and all cases found at carantine.
By traveling to this community, new infections are completely affected.
By exploring agressive contacts, internally traveling, investigation, and quarantine, the coronavir pandemy 2020 in Singapore developed much more longer than other developing countries, despite extreme statements, such as restaurants and ritel firms.
Many actions were cancelled, and Singapore recommended the people to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were opened back right after freedom on 23 March.
Some other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contacts, internally traveling, testing, and quarantine, but with non - aggressive areas, such as Iceland and South Korea.
One study finds that countries testing more, related to the number of deaths, have a much lower case fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have low signals or without signs.
WHO agreed that countries who have no research capacity, and nationality with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive examples of COVID-19 and ten first negative samples to one of the 16th WHO areas for conference investigation.
From 16 places, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Africa.
In this context, the "%Positive Test Result" column was affected by the national test policy.
The country that only tests those who are concerned in the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive results than the country that tests all its people, whether they show signs or not, with other factors.
The hands, which are also called with cleanness of hands, are the acts of purifying the hands of someone who intends to lose the wheat, the oil, the micro-medium, or the other which is not desired.
He cut his hands with a consistent cup on the "critical seat" certainly prevents the preaching of many diseases, such as diar and cholera, exposed through the word-oral path.
People may also have a disease of inflammation, such as influenza or sequence, if they do not cut their hands before touching the eyes, the mouth, or the mouth.
Five times of criticism that is very important for the whole day to cut off the hands with a sacco is: before and after the big water, after the kid’s legs, or after the kid’s cup, before eating, before and after preparing meat, fishing, or illness.
If there is no water and sand, the hands can be cleaned with a thorn.
Earlier, when, and after preparing a breakfast.
Before and after the sick.
Just move the pockets or release the kids who just used a toilet.
Once cleansing the wheat, the wheat, or the wheat.
Once touching animals, animals, or animals.
The cleanness of the medical hands refers to purity practices related to medical procedures.
Snap your hands before giving medicines or medical careers can prevent or reduce the illness preachment.
The main medical goal is to remove the hands from the patogen (bacteria, virus, or other microemees that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause a disease or a disease.
This is most important for those who care for peace or work in medical fields, but it is also important for the public.
The screening of hands has many benefits of health, including minimising influenza, coronal virus and other diseases; preventing diarrhoea causes; reducing infections;
and reduce the child’s mortality at home.
In 2013, it shows that practical inflammation can reduce the growth of the baby’s highest growth.
In developing countries, the mortality of children can be reduced by reporting the changes of simple behavior, such as cutting the hands with samples.
This simple action can reduce the mortality of the disease to nearly 50%.
Intervention that prevents the handsheet can decrease the cases of diarrhoea to around it; this can be used by providing clean water in the low-grassed area.
48% of the case can be scared with the hands of a sabuw. Snapping hands with a sabuw is the only way that is most effective and furious to prevent the diarrhoea and the infection of acute injury (ISPA), as the underlying behavior in the house, school, and society worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major ISPA, is the cause of the death of one babie child; this disease causes the death of about 1,8 million children per year.
Diare and pneumonia caused nearly 3,5 million children.
According to UNICEF, make hands with a bathroom before eating and after using a toilet to be a conscious habit can save more lives other than vaccine or any medical action, and reduce death until half and death results in the infection of acute disorders until the fourth.
Its usual hands are associated with other health actions as part of water, health and cleanness programs (WASH).
It also protects himself from the empetigo that is directly exposed to physical contacts.
Small-small effects are often broken hands that can cause skin injury.
In 2012, in Denmark, it was found that overwhelming hands could cause the skin condition, which is known as hand or hand dermatitis, which is most often occurred among health workers.
Too often also seems to be one of the symbols of compulsif-compulsif disturbance (OCD).
There are five times critics all the day when we cut hands with a bathroom is important to reduce illness orally, yes: before and after using a toilet (small water, big water) after wearing the kids (using pouchs), before wearing the child, before eating and/which preparing meat, fish, or illness.
Another time is important to apply the right hands to prevent the illness injury is before and after the wound; after the wine, the rocks, or the rocks; after touching the animals or to treat animals; and after touching the sampling.
In many countries, the hands are still low.
A study on hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that the rate of 38.7% of the houses was inputed with a sabuw. A 2014 study shows that Saudi Arabs had the highest rates of 97 per cent; the United States had a middle of 77 per cent; and the Tiongkok at the rate of 23 per cent. Now there are some methods of behaviour to increase the adoption of the behaviour of their behavior at the moment of the criticism. The shopping of the hands to learn at the time that has been determined was one option in the countries developed to normalize the hands in their children's behaviour.
The Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the right steps to support health and children’s care.
The damage of cakes twice a year, transplanted with the hands of the day with the daily teeth with fluorides, is the original of this national programme.
This program was also implemented in Indonesia.
Microeconomic cleaning from the skin is strengthened by the swimming or deterioration of water.
The main work is to decrease the loss of destruction and increase the strength.
Only water is an inefficiency in the skin because of grass and proteins, which are organic crap components, is not easy in the water.
Instead, weight and protein are helped by sufficient water alliation.
In the same way, because its characteristics can be used back, it may be possible to reduce the bacteria obtained from previous use.
A number of small studies that investigate the bacteria’s inflammation of the contamination sample concluded that the inflammation could not occur because of the normal bacteria with the bus.
Yet, the CDC continues to say "the crap that's running out without touching the hands is more likely."
Anti-bacteria sanctions are largely prevented from health-conscious society.
Today, there is no evidence that antiseptic use or disinfektion is better for an antibiotic organism in the world.
However, an antibacterious sack is a general antibacterian agent like a triclosan, which contains a large stainless organic record.
Thus, although antibiotic foreigners are not supported by antibacteria, this sacco may not be effective.
Further than surface and skin protection, a fluid formula can include assets (assorts, assorbits, lactates) as pH system, benzoate as active antimicrobians, and further skin conditions (frugs, vitamins, extracts, growth extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the Oregon University Health Factory shows that the normal muscles are the same effective with an antibacterious anti-bacterian tumors containing triclosans in preventing diseases and eliminating bacteria from hands.
The warm water is not enough to kill bacteria.
The growth bacters are faster on the body’s suit (37 °C).
The heat water is more efficient than the cold water in the loss of natural oil that holds the cotton and the bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many people, scientific studies show that heat water use does not have any effect in reducing the number of microbs in the hands.
Manual or antiseptic service is an unbased cleansing agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21th century, the cleanness of hands was a non-based alcoholic agent (a.k.a. basic alcohol, antiseptic hands, or handservice) began to be known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated together with a protein, such as Carbomer (acrilate acrylate acid polymer) to be gel or with glucerin rubber or bus to easily use and to reduce the effects of alcohol.
Increasing antimicrobial activity increases the enzyme oxigen. The main service that has at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient killer.
Alcohol preservation kills bacteria, bacteria holding against many medicines (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of virus (including HIV, herpes, RSVs, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol service 70% killed 99.97% (log 3.5, similar to 35 decibles) bacteria in 30 seconds after input and 99.99% up to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hands of 1 minute after input.
The main - based alcohol preservation is not effective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for gastrointestinal gastrointestinity.
Forward and back two hands, and in the halls, and the end of all fingers were cut about 30 seconds to the wheat, the bus, or the dry gel.
The finger finger must also be broken well by cutting it in two hands. The control centre and the United States Sickness are more suggesting the hands of the hands of the hands, especially when the hands appear to be covered.
Increasing the use of service agents because of the ability to use and the rapid murder activity against micro-emotion; but the service agent should not be used as a correct handsheet, unless the waters are available.
The use of handservices can often cause dry skin, unless emolines and/or skin in the formula are cut off.
Effects of alcohol can be reduced or lost by dragging glucerin and/or other emolines into the formula.
In the clinical trial, a basic alcoholic serving that resists emolien causes irritation and skin disorder rather than antimicrobial deterioration.
Alergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive plants in the hands of alcohol.
Lower concentration causes the contact dermatitis to be the power of this product, rather than cutting the hands with water and soap.
Although efficient, the non-air agent doesn't remove the hands from the organic sample, but only defects it.
Because of this, the hands are not effective in preventing the preaching of many patterns because the patogens are still in the hands.
The benefit of free alcoholic service depends very on its grains and formulations, and the history indicates that this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation that uses benzalconium chloride has been demonstrated has continued and simulated antimicrobial activity after entering, not as alcohol, which shows that its advantage was reduced after recovery, perhaps because of progressive sam effects.
Many people in the community are not able to purchase and use hair or land as a farmer.
Eggs or land may be more effective than only water, but less efficient than soft.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microem, land or age may increase the preliminary illness preliminary.
Similarly, it is also a disinfektion agent because, if you contact the water, you will have an alkaline.
WHO commends the wheat and the wheat as an alternative to the wheat when the wheat is not available.
Technology washed the right hands based on the recommendation of the United States Sickness Centre for Disturbance of illness includes the following steps:
Base your hands with warm or cold.
The water is combined because the bascon may be contaminated, but it seems that the waters are not affected.
Take your hands with a lot of cups, including your hands, in the fingers and under my cup.
The Sabun has a skin of the skin, and the study shows that people are able to cut their hands more accurately when they use samples than when they use water only.
The guy's at least 20 seconds.
Increasing the creation of a whistle, which helps lose the skin of the skin and lose more than a longer.
The currency is exactly under the water.
In the basque, the hands can be contaminated again.
Shut up with dry lamps or let the air swallow.
The lack of hands and hands are easierly contaminated again.
I'm a building and a cocktail that's missing can keep a micro-eyemme.
Losions often have been recommended to keep their hands off; thick skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A number of low payment options can be made to facilitate the screening of the hands when the water is not available, for example, cutting water from the rubber or bottle that is cut down and used and/or using rubber, if necessary, in the country of developing. In the case of the low-scale water (as school or area of destruction in developing countries), there are low water solutions, such as "tippy-stap", and other lower options.
The tippy warm is a simple use of the water bottle that is broken with the hair, the tissue that was operated by the feet to cut a little water into the hands, and a bit of a safe.
Effective hand transmission is a major part of the process of cleanness of hands, but there are debates on the form of the most effective hand intake in the public toilet.
Increasing research shows that the paper is much cleaner than the boxing of the hands found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was held by the University of Westminster, London, and provided by the European Tissue Symposium paper industries, to compare the purity of the paper, the warm air driving, and the more moderated jet air driving.
Soon as you cut and slipped your hands with warm aircraft, the total number of bacteria was found to increase the degree of 194% in my fingers and 254% in my hands.
Increasing with jet airing causes the total number of bacteria 42% in their fingers and 15% in their hands.
After cutting and slipping the hands with the paper, the total number of bacteria reduced 76% in their fingerprints and 77% in their hands.It also conducted a test to determine the potential of syringe contamination on other toilet users and toilet environments resulting in all types of inhalation methods.
Jet air carrier, which split air from unit with 180 m/s of speed (650 km/h; 400 mph), can cut microemes from hands and units and potentially break the other toilet users and the toilet environment to 2 metres.
The use of warm air carrying out the micro-medium to 0.25 metres from the driving.
In 2005, in the study held by TÜV Product and Environment, various methods of divaluation of the hands.
Once a hand-inspiration, the number of bacteria changes is observed:
There are many hand-driving manufacturers, and hand-taking has been compared to inflammation using the paper.

Man - based alcohol service needs at least 60% of alcohol.
The medical screening was long - suffered after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found his effect (in 1846) in preventing sickness in the hospital environment.
There are electronic arrangements that provide back to remind the hospital workers to cut their hands if they forget.
One study found that the infection rates are down with the use of that ship.
The medical screening for at least 15 seconds, using water and sands in many or gels to build and cut off the hands.
The hands have to be cut on each other with the fingers of each other.
If there's a bullet under me, the bullet can be used to lose it.
Since the chest can keep it in the water that is in the hands, the hands need to be stuck accurately and thrown with pure lamps.
Once dry, the paper laptop is used to swimming water (and opening the door out if necessary).
This action avoids recontamination of hands from the surface.
The purpose of cutting hands in health care systems is to lose the micro-emotion of the patogen ("cream") and avoid the outcome.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of hands was still cut off on a rate that could not be accepted in most of the medical environment, with a large number of doctors and sisters forgot to switch their hands before touching the patient so that they had a microeme.
One study shows that the screening of the right hands and other simple procedures can reduce the infection of the most terrified blood ills to 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has issued a depreciation that shows the standards of hands and hands in the health care sector.
The WHO’s concept of cleanness can also be viewed on its website for public comments.
The relevance of Whitby et al.
Commercial rules can evaluate and validate the cleanness of hands if the demonstration of delicateness is required.
World Health Organization has "Fief time" to cut hands:
after bleeding into blood/body
before an aseptic task, and
after the patient's care. An antiseptic chemical exhibition to sabage (subsubsubjects) or "antimicrobs" functions to kill the hand-coated chemical.
The function of killing may be wanted before making a cover or in a position when an antibiotic body holds very lazy. For 'taking' the hands before the dilution, it is necessary to delay and in no touching, clorhexidine or yodium, steril lap to slippe the hands after cutting, and steril illness to cut and other sterile instruments to meet under me.
It's necessary to be released.
This procedure is designed to cut hands and hands down to the board, usually 2-6 minutes.
A long time (10 minutes) is not required.

In order to control stafilococus infections in the hospital, the biggest benefits have been cleared from 20% of the first screening, and that the benefits of highly small benefits are reduced by the frequency of hand-frequency over 35%.
Increasing inflammation infection diseases are more than three times compared to antibacteria. The comparison between throwing hands with basic alcohol and cutting hands with antibacteria with the median period every 30 seconds shows that the basic alcohol rates reduce the contamination of the bacteria 26% more than antibacteria.
However, safe and water is more effective than basic alcohol rates to reduce the A H1N1 influenza virus and the Clostridium spores from hands. Interventions to increase the cleanness of hands in health care systems can involve the dispute of staff’s hands cutting, increasing the presence of alcohol based hands, and written reminders and license to staff.
More research is needed to know the most effective intervention in various health care claims.
In developing lands, he was broken his hands with a cup of appreciation as a basic way to achieve good health and even a good nutrition.
Yet, at least the waters that can be controlled, the bathroom, or the injury of the household, the school, and the workplace, makes it possible to reach the universal hands’ behaviour.
For example, in most areas of Africa’s dishes, the hands are in the nearby of the private toilet or public toilet, even though there are options to make a worm handscake.
In any case, the low rate of hands can also occur because of the habits that have been thrown and not because of the minimum of the water or of the water.
Increasing awareness of the benefits of the hands, and changes in the behaviour of the population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
The systematic attitude towards 70 studies found that an efficient community approach is increasing the LMIC arms, while the social market campaign is more efficient. One example of the school's hand-speaking is "Tree Bintang" by the UNICEF who pressed the school to take simple and mild steps to put students on the hands with a bathroom, among other laws of freedom.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to three stars.
Building a handsheet can be part of a campaign of a handsheet to reduce the disease and death of the children.
The day of the World Hand is another example of a conscientious campaign that tries to achieve the purpose of changed behaviour.
Some studies investigated the effectiveness of paying hands in the countries developed in their relationship with Disability-Adjusted Live Year (DALY) or a lost year of disease.
One factor shows that dismantling the hands with a bathroom significantly more deteriorated from water interventions and other health.
It is important to cut hands for human health, especially for people in a rental condition, such as a newborn mother or an injured soldier in the hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two pure hands: Dr. Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care officer" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infection is caused by a wound that is called mysma or bad air.
In the 1980 ’ s, the infections that were produced through health care and infection made the Centre of Control and the United States Sickness more active moved the cleanness of hands as an important way to prevent the infection preachment.
In 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemy, in 2020, increased the conscience of many countries would be important to cut hands with a safe to protect themselves from that disease.
For example, the poster "the right hands cut off" was thrown at the bottom of the public toilet and at the toilet of the office and aircraft in Germany.
Increasing "slipping hands from" something means to express the responsibility of someone to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
It was from the Bible chapter in Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate cut his hands on the decision to identify Jesus Christ, but it became an outstanding evidence in the English community.

The religion commands the purity and the symbolic purposes of purity. The symbolic shipping of hands, which use water, but without the water, is a part of the ritual to cut hands into many religions, including the faith of Bahái, Hindu, and the unrealisticness of the Jewish, Lavabo in the Christian, and Wudhu in Islam. The religion also orders the cleanness of the hands, especially after certain acts.
The Hindu religion, the Jewish, and the Islam forced their hands after using a toilet.
Moreover, Hindu, Buddhah, Sikh, Jewish, and Islam forced their hands before and after eating.
COVID-19 workshop control
The COVID-19 workshop control is the view of safety and health methodology for the control of organic diseases using coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper management of the workplace depends on jobs and jobs, based on market source risks, illness in society, and risk factors for each employee that may result in the rate of COVID-19.
According to the United States Security and Work Health (OSHA), low market risks have a minimum contact with the public and other fellow workers; for this work, it is encouraged to prevent basic infection, which includes cutting the hands, encourage workers to live in the house if sickness, ethics, and to make cleanness and routine infection of work environment.
Marketing risks are involved in work that requires a close contact or often with those who are unknown or who are expected to call COVID-19, but may be infected because of the outcome of the community that is going on or internationally traveling.
It includes workers who have contacts with public communities such as in school, work environment with high population attitudes, and high volume rituals.
The control of the disorders for these bullets, other than the steps to prevent basic infection, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air trailer, protecting against gin, and provides self-protection tools when you met COVID-19.
OSHA considers a healthy household and a living room offered to those who are known or demanded to say COVID-19 to risk high markets, which increases the risk of high markets if workers do a successive procedure on, or take or handle the species of, known or demanded to COVID-19.
A suitable worker control includes technical controls, such as the ventilation rooms, and self - protection tools.
COVID-19 can have some impacts on work.
A worker may not come to work because of sickness, needs to care for others, or because of fear of the potential of the market.
The business pools can change, well in some kinds of things that are requested or in the way to get these things (as a travelling outside the hour, through the education, or the layout).
Finally, scientists from a very viewed geografic area of COVID-19 can be distorted.
The article considers the threatened risk rates of various jobs and jobs, including market sources, risk factors from home and society, and risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also emphasizes the needed controls to cope with the risks and the plans for a situation that may result in the results of a disorder.
The prescription and plans of illness may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The aim of the discipline involves reducing the output between staff, protecting those who are higher risks for harmful health complexity, maintaining business operations, and minimising harmful effects on other entities in the ships.
The rate of diseases in the community where business is affected by the commitments taken.
The survey of the labour is a smaller work that is used in the health and health of the work to explode the control of the material based on its efficacy.
If COVID-19 is not able to lose, the most effective control is technical control, administrative control, and the last self-defense tool.
Technical controls enable workers to isolate workers from the loss of work without depending on the worker’s behavior and can be the most valuable solution to apply.
Administrative control is a change in the policy or work procedure that requires work or work.
Protection tools (APD) are considered effectively compared to technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent parts of the market.
All types of APD must be selected based on workers, equipped correctly as it is (e.g. respirator), consistently and true, inspected, occupied, and waited hardly, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and stored correctly or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Security and Work Health (OSHA), low market risks have a minimum contact with the public and other fellow workers.
Steps of prevention of basic infections for all work places including often cut off the hands closely, pressing the workers to live in the house if sick, the ethics include hiding rocks and shippings, supplying networks and rubbers, preparing work from remote hours or workshops with time of entry/seat, if necessary, members know the employees not to use any other tools and deficiencies, and performing freedom and infections in the work environment.
The quick and isolated characteristics of potential individuals are important in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The United States Centre of Control and illness (CDC) recommends that workers who have acute diseases should live in the house until they are free from the home, the signs of silver, and other signs for at least 24 hours without the use of drugs or other signal change medicines, and that the practice of a flexible disease may allow the employee to live in the house to take care of a sick family member, and that the employee may know this policy.
According to OSHA, market risking work is involved in work that requires contacts nearly or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with persons who are unknown or demanded to call COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the outcome of the community around the business site, or because someone has made a new international journey to the locality with a large COVID-19 output.
This publication includes workers who have contacts with the public society like in the school, work environment with high popularity, and high volume ritel service. Technical management and high risk control includes the installation of highly efficiency air filters, enhancement of the ventilation, incoming the ability of physical responsibility such as plastic guardians, and the installation of the windows of drivers or laptops for mobility service. Administrative controls for this lock and high risks includes the installation of high risks of highly efficiency air filters, enhancement of the windshops, enhancement of the windstorships, engagement of the guardians, or engineering of the worker, during the entry/department, and the remote service of this cycle and the high risk control of high risks included the high risks and the high risks of the higher risk filters, the highest risks of the highest efficiency, the highest spect of the winds of the spect of the house, the spect of the spect of the works of the board, the Office of the Office and the Office of the Office and the Office of the Officeration of the Office and the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office and the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of Office Officer Officer Officer Office , and the Office Office Office Officer Office Office Office , and the Office , and the Office Office , Office Office , and the Office Office , and the Office Office of Office Office Office of Office Office , and the Office , and the Office , and the Office Office of Office of Office Office Office Office Office , and the Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office , and the Office Office Office Office , and the , and the Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office , and the , , , , , , , , Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office , , , , , , and the , , and the , and the Office Office Office , and the Office Office , , , and the Office Office Office Office , , , , , , , and the , , , and , , and , and , , and , , Office Office Office Office Office Office Office Office , , , , , , and the , , , , Office Office , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , and , and , and , and , and , and           , ,      , , ,         , ,  , ,       , , , , ,     , , ,                , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , and , , , , and , , , , , ,
Workers in these risks often need a respirator.
If a person falls sick in the aircraft, the right control to protect the worker and other passengers involves separating a sick person from the other with a 6 - foot, making one cabin guard to care for the sick, and offering a face mask to a sick person or asking him to shut the mouth and swallow his mouth with a tissue when a rock or a cup.
The cabins must use one of the medical hands at the same time when they care for a sick passenger or to touch the body's wheat or the potential of a heat that is contaminated and may be another protective tool if a painful passenger suffers distress, continues, or difficulties.
One hand and one other clothing must be removed in the woods, and the contaminated surface must be cleaned and disinfekted after it. For commercial study, including aircraft and other passenger ships, the ship control includes travelling if sickness, isolating, and informing the medical center on the ship soon if someone experiences disorders or other signs when he is on the ship.
Ideally, the continued medical action in the cabine of individuals isolated, despite the public ministry, for schools and children’s failure, the CDC agrees on the arrangements that are not appropriate to eliminate or defect if a person is ever infected in the school building.
If there is an outcome in society at the minimum level until there is, social statement strategy can be applied, which includes: cancel visits, meetings, and other large assemblies, such as natural reactions, categories of voice, or eating in the cafetaria, increase the time between tables, income and inconsistent lands, restrict visits, and use the local health office separate for children with a fluid sign.
If there is a high outcome in the local community, in the social strategy, it is possible to consider a longer educational settlement. For a legal employee who has done a routine activity, a direct risk of health is considered to be low by CDC.
The legal employee who should contact persons confined or claimed COVID-19 has been commanded to follow the same subject to medical technology, including using suitable self-guard tools.
If a close contact occurs during the arrival, the worker must clean and disinfekte the low and deficiency of the task before re-using by using the hall-by-proteint or the hall and follow the standard operational procedure to control and remove the ACPD file and to control and cut the garments.
OSHA considers a health career and a certain body room in a high or high market risk category.
High market risks include health care, support, kolium, and medical transport feeds that are covered with known or worth COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes a very high market risk if workers make a successful procedure on, or take or handle the species of, the patient known or demanded COVID-19.
Intubacy, induction procedures, broncoscope, some teeth processes, or invasion of species.
The work of the staff risks high markets involve the workers involved in preparing the body of a known person or demanding the case of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high market if workers do automatically. This technic control includes a isolation room for those who are known or deserved to COVID-19, including when the process is successful.
Specific negative pressure may be adjusted in some health care careers and in the body rooms.
Specimen must be handled with the deficiency of the level of biological security 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the patients coming to be separated into a different waiting room based on the case of COVID-19. Furthermore, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of those who are known or who are infectioned by SARS-CoV-2, and those who do a successful procedure.
In the United States, the N95 - face filter respirator, which is accepted by NIOSH or better, should be used in the context of the written and comprehensive program of protection, which includes appropriate tests, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirator can give greater protection and increase the workshop. WHO doesn't assume the closure of the whole or coverall because COVID-19 is a disorder disease and is not exported through the body's search.
WHO simply thinks of the mask for the crossing workers at the inside point.
For those who take the species of inflammation, care, or take COVID-19 patients without a successful procedure, the WHO agreed on the main masker, the protective staff, or the road, the clothes, and the hands.
If the process is performed in a position, the mask is waited with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Remembering that the APD armies are not enough over the world, the WHO agrees to minimise the needs of APD through a remote doctoral service, physically as the views window, with only those involved in direct care can enter the COVID-19 patients' room, using only the APD needed for certain tasks, continue using the same respirator without freedom when careing for many patients with the same diagnosis, including and coordinating the APD arms, and not encouraged the use of the mask for people without a sign.

COVER SUBJECT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: No rights protected
We have found ourselves in the wonderful event of this month.
Epidemy COVID-19 is something that makes the worldwide human gratitude and the responsibility we have.
We have never experienced its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the form of the seat, the same work, and the building of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and friendship we have just been among all the workers through email, calling, and rolling is a wonderful validation, there's a wonderful human, which we're lucky enough to work with them.
Thank you and my proudness can not even call you as a fellow worker.
A week ago, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of the meaning of the world today to be able to join Wikipedia, and how powerful it is for this important source to remain ready for everyone.
You can do this, even if you feel that this is still running, helping our fellow believers pay, or helping to keep our social security.
The world needs information available to the Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when not only the work that we do, but the way we do it, will make the effects of the world.
Since this mission and your role in it are important, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin the next week.
Recognizing Our Works and Works
As Robyn said earlier, the team met last night to discuss our neighborhoods and boards for a few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response for the challenges that we face and the best way to keep our organization’s need for this time.
We want to lose pressure and support our mission for long-term.
If you need to decrease the job, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our day - to - day hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the knowledge continues.
We don't set free day, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world can’t be predicted at this time, and you need to care for the dear ones, to care for the needs of the point, or to go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't keep your job time.
If you are sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we said it.
Sickness or PTO is not required, give sufficient information to your manager and your team help revising calendars and workshops that may be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positively at COVID-19, you hope to tell Bryan in T&C Ops so T&C can help with support and make sure you get proper attention from the manager).
His companions' rewards are based on the hour.
We have said it, and again, to respect our committee to the contractors and staff based hours.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their working hours when normal conditions are normal.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to disturb the stress of the world around us.
The work we're doing can be a lot of satisfaction, especially in these times.
Moreover, the main thing is to be careful.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what you need to anticipate and can take the right action.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to continue to travel.
SRE, SDM operations, confidence and security, and Dana promotion team, inter alia, do important jobs that may need greater support.
We will start processing with all the departments to pursue the present purpose and focus on supporting essential things for our mission.
There are many things to be in our behalf for all of us, we will only focus full on the most essential projects.
Let's be late now. It'll be nothing for the future.
We're not planning to "small work to lose loss" after this pandemic passed.
You will not be expected to work mild to fulfill the unreasonable period of time.
We realized that the changes and efforts would be to set a new timeline, if necessary.
What about the APP?
In order to match new realities and expect the hours of daily work, we intend to fit the timeline for the implementation of the Science Plan 2020-2012.
We're going to take the 2019-2020 length that allows more time to make an invitation so that workers can prioritize important work, self-sook, and the career of those who are dear by commodating those who need or want to work with a job less for a few weeks ahead.
This timeline decreases the current work and planning pressure in all the organizations.
We will understand our proposal to the God of the next week, and we will draw up the delegation and team on the next step soon after we have received a conference.
Thank you for the APP team.
Status, markets, and office pursuits
The week ago, we were told that one of our companions based on the SF may have been in the COVID-19 virus.
However, because we were very worried, we had an antivirus antivirus cross in order to defect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use an antivirus inhibitors in the hospital to infect the opposite, the lobby, and all the lifts that are attached to our ground.
The building enforces its own safeguard protocol using the product that supports the safety of its protector.
We felt happy that the office would be prepared when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members based in the DC.
Once a week ago, our DC office moved to a remote work rate, with a shared board with San Francisco.
As known by some of our associates based in NYC, we are also discussing about giving a place in Brooklyn.
This debate continues, but maybe there will be a debat.
For the first time, some of our fellow believers work out of the distance.
Our long - working companions realize that this may need correction and that they want to advise you:
The last one or two hours of duration.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Definition is clear, make a calendar, and send a previous time.
Make video as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and connection directly.
You can make it easy for your reports, for you to address your questions, for you to write the booklets, and for you to help you make a note (or to make a co-operative note).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health to sell small sales.
Contact #remoties in Slack to talk to a companion about shared work
The SDM Operation Team is looking for a basic web-based engine to support the workshops distributed throughout Yayasan.
This week later, we asked all recipients of community changes to cancel the public statement based on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO's statement of pandemics has ended.
We recognized them that we understand our requests for information and other statements can make them unable to fulfill the accepted changes and that no one will be given to the penalty because they need to deal with or modify the program.
The next week we will continue with a large role on Wikimania and the regional and other community conferences.
Generally, the sensation of the whole global community seems to be a disappointment of this disturbance, but at the same time the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, as well as Wikimedia as others.
Forward, the CRT is trying to prepare a page in the Meta-Wiki to provide a community room to control our impact and follow our communication with them.
Keep connected during COVID-19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar to Cames at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special staff mail.
We will use this time to share a lot of questions, answer your questions, and take time to connect each other.
We're all together in this area and we want to help more of us.
Meanwhile, you can keep getting information from this e-mail and all the most important information COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
The CRT will continue to broadcast this page and keep all the information on one place.
We are also trying to keep routine communication with staff living in countries that currently look significantly.
If you have questions about traveling, age, main work tools, or distress about lifting, or other things that may need help, do not doubt to know and work together with the CRT.
We were here to help support and become connectors according to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operation SDM International.
No such changes are viewed as our works and our obligations.
Instead, this change is a conviction that our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps that we make important to support each other in this area so that we can continue to work, provide support that is needed for our movements, and members of the world of service that they represent.
The work we planned earlier will be there to wait for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and to create a room for important work that will come within a few weeks and maybe a few months ahead.
We need you all to do it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work better when you need.
Finally, please cut your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the members of the team of other events (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is placed on the outside cell (cells) surface in the powder, artery, heart, ginger, and ions.
ACE2 has an activity contrary to angiotensin enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II and increased angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a target that promises to treat cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also works as a point of input into cells for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human version is often called hACE2.
The enzyme of angiotensine 2 overview is the metaloenzyme that is located in the endote cells and other cells.
ACE2 proteins have M2 peptidase terminal-N and amenic transporter domain of amino renal collectin-C terminal.
ACE2 is a single type I membrane protein, with an encircumcised active domain on the top of the cells in the powder and other networks.
ACE2 extract domain is separated from the transmembran domain by other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the transient protein resulted in the blood alert and finally diescreen into the urin.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 is located on the primary cell cell of the alveolar cell type II, small enterosit, artery and vena endote cells, and the arterial pool cells in most organs.
ACE2’s expressions were also found in cerebral, striatum, hypothalam, and brains.
The primary function ACE2 is the ACE calculator.
ACE separated angiotension hormone I to angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 broke carboxyl amino phenilalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it to angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide some other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also sets the SLC6A19 neutral transport membrane and is involved in Hartnup diseases.
As transmembran proteins, ACE2 functions as a primary point in the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus caused by COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 protein detection on SRS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 sprays or enzymes with an enzyme domain of ACE2 at the upper cell causes endosis and translocation of virus and enzyme into the endosum placed in the cell.
This virus process also needs primating S protein by TMPRSS2-protease series which is currently sering as a potential therapy. This makes people hypothesis that the ACE2-infections in the cell may help combat infections.
However, many professional society and regulatory body recommend that they continue ACE and ARB standard inhibitor therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis practice, published on 11 July 2012, found that "ACE inhibitor use causes significant 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also reduced the risk of pneumonia to patients with higher risk for pneumonia, mostly the stroke and heart failure patients.
ACE inhibitor use is also threatened with the increasing mortality of pneumonia, although the results are less strong than the risk of all pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute chemotherapy, and it seems to increase the hemodinamic hepatic and oxygen saturation in children with acute inhalation syndrome induced by lipoplisakaride.
The half hour of rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute newspaper other than a 24 - hour efficacy.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a medicine that promises patients with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS-inhibitor) or to the disease with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in the clinical trial for the treatment of an acute inhalation syndrome.
b'App COVID-19 is an application of a mobile board designed to help detect contacts to refresh coronavirus 2019-2020, which is the process of identifying people ("contact") who may have made contact with infected ones.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which are supported by the governments in some areas and divisions.
Some jobs to build contact track applications have been developed.
Privacy problem is asked, mainly divided with a system based on the identifier of the geografic location of the user’s application.
The options that are not too important to the privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to note user approaches with other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth basic application directly in the Android and iOS operation system.
In Tiongkok, the Government of Tiongkok, together with Alipay, has given applications that allow the citizens to check if they have contacted the COVID-19 newspaper.
This application is used in more than 200 Tiongkok cities. In Singapore, the application named TraceTogether is used.
This application is developed by local TI community, written as an open source and delivered to governments. Northern Macedonia has released "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track a market against people who are infected and give a quick response to the health care authority.
This application is developed by the Communication and Technology and Health Government.
By 14 April 2020, the application still waited for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store agreement.
On 12 April, the government stated that the application of contacts was in progress and will be available to be published within a few weeks. The same application was planned in Ireland and France.
The New Zealand and the New Zealand are considering the application based on TraceTogether Singapura and BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intended to report the geofencing application for COVID-19 patients living in Moskow; this application was designed to make them not leave home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Technology at the University of Cambria, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on the basic application system, which includes false positives and the probability of less efficiency if data taken by the application are limited to a small part of the population.
To cope with anxiety about the "coronavirus" preaching that is increasing or dangerous, Apple sets a limit to a type of organization that can cause the most dangerous coronavirus application to App Store, which is limited only to the "resmi" organization or who has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon applied the same statement.
Private supporters determine their care about the implication of mass survey using coronavirus applications, especially whether the survey infrastructure made to handle coronavirus pandemics will be stopped after threatening.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have exploited a statement that limits such survey.
This organization explains eight conditions in the government project:
Surveillance must "conform law, need, and proportional";
the growth of the survey and monitoring must have the sun's hearing;
data use must be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the safety and anonymity of data must be protected and proved to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital survey must avoid more discrimination and marginalisation;
The data share with third parties must be defined in invitations;
There must be a protection against the use and the right of the citizens of the country to repay the discharge;
Participation means all my "valuable interests" needed, which includes public health experts and termarginalisation. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) German and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without Borders) (RSF) also exit the checking list.
The Google/Others proposed plan intends to cope with the survey problem with the elimination of tracking mechanisms from the government operation system after it is not required again.
Some countries use the network based locations, not applications, so that they have to lose the need for applications and ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, based networks were accepted.
Basic network solutions that have access to local data have significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with the central server need to connect to the private location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and used the central server only to intercommunicate (see section below).
In South Korea, unbased application systems are used to make contact reviews.
As a result of special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes data on the tracking of the cellular system and the transaction of cards, and associates this information to produce information through the text message to those who are infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, government also makes the local information available for public, which has been allowed with significant changes to the private invitations of information after the MESR in that country.
This information is available for public through a number of applications and websites. German countries such as Germany consider to use a system once that protects the privacy.
By 6 April 2020, the details are not written yet.
The contacts protecting the privacy are a concept that has already been maped, with a large number of studies started from at least in 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a thousand experts make a large private solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the use of users with other phones.
However, the PP-PT is an effort to coordinate the approach to centralization and centralization, not a single protocol. The centralisation protocol includes the approach to protect the overcentralised privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the timely contact number (TCN), the previously called Contact Event Number, CEN, Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Cellular Contact Control (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified have never left the battle, and all advocates occur in the war.
Privacy groups in MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, platform to use technology to protect the privacy when collecting and using locality or data for tracking the COVID-19 service.
This is based on the "Apps Gone Rogue: Contenting Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" study written in March 2020.The other platform was also SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy and was also included in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses a safe hardship to allow users to share local and health data with other users and workers without offering the data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the global CNS coalition was designed by celluloses that have the same approach and are the same protocols that are a lot of movement, with a view to reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for applications of reviews and warnings, which are the main aspects of achievement of large receipts.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that they had made BlueTrace protocols used by its government's military applications to be open sources.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the company who controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative to track contacts, which they claimed to protect the privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography that protects the privacy.
They also mobilize specifications of the intel used in that system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be destroyed in three steps:
a tool to enable government to make the original application of coronavirus control protecting the privacy
This function integration directly planned to iOS and Android Google and Apple to address the problems of data transport and survey continued to distribute the system through the operational system and then remove it in the same way after the threat occurred.
b'Reposition of medicines (including new purposes, new profiles, or new tasks on medicines or therapy) is the use of medicines which have been approved for new treatment purposes, in particular for diseases or medical conditions different to the initial development of the medicine.
This path is a scientific investigation path that is currently in the area of developing safe and effective COVID-19 medicines.
Another research direction includes the development of COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 proteins that can be medical targets, each protein has a few intervals of ligan.
Analysis on the sites of this liga can be the basis for an effective antiviral medicine development projects against protein COVID-19.
Some of the most important proteins of SARS-CoV-2 targets are the proteases like papaine, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helikase, protein S, and ADP ribofosfatase.

WHO introduced lopinavir/ritonavir in the test of international solidarity.
Gilead Sciences was designed and developed as a medication for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that it had antivirus activity in vitro against some philosophy, pneumo-, paramics-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistence through mutation that can cause worse diseases and transmissions.
Some early test studies show the remdesivir may have a high genetic disorder against resistence. There are some clinical trials running, including two clinical tests held by the University of Cleveland’s Sickness, one for people with sickness and another for sick people.
There are three clinical tests for intravenous vitamin C for people who are concerned with COVID-19 pain, namely two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italia).

Tocilisumab (anti-reseptor IL-6): Accepted by Tiongkok.
Furthermore, the test is also in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaccin COVID-19 is hypotetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that performs clinical tests, there are many efforts to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the WHO, according to the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this illness virus, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were studying Fase I security in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The large wave was spread throughout the world in 2020, which caused investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the publiced genom to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative stated in April that what is needed in developing vaccine is speed, production capacity, preaching at the necessary scales, and global access.
In April, the CEPI mountain reported that 10 different platforms were in investigation and development during the beginning of 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target that is progressing to Fase I Security Study, addresses:
Nuclear asylum (DNA and RNA) (Developing Fase I and candidate vaccine: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Vektor virus (Fase I money and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biology, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by the CEPI scientist in April, the total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the beginning of development, which 78 were configured as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with little public information available (not in planning or planning).
Testing Fase I-II tests of safety and immunogenity, usually in a low-controlled placebo, and in some places, determining the correcter effective dose.
The trial of Fase III usually involves more experts, including controls, and tests the efficiency of vaccine to prevent illness, controlling the effect of sampling on optimal dose.
From the 79 active vaccine candidates developed (configured early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (a.k.a. "practics").
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular vaccines that would genetically modify virus proteins to prevent immune reactions.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a bio-company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported particular developments like coronavirus with part of Canada Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is being studied in eniuum, with human tests planned in July or August 2020.
The Guardian reported that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, has offered "a large number of money" for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced the migration with the German company, BioNTech, for together to develop the based vaccine of MRNA.
Currently, the vaccine candidate is based on MRNA, BNT162, is in the preclinic study with clinical tests will be considered to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian Biotech biological company announced that they would receive the results of the practical examination in April 2020 and that the vaccine candidate at the end could begin to be tested on humans at the morning.
On March 19, 2020, the Epidemic Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment in US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaxin Research Consortium, which included Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wine, Austria), and the Pittsburgh University, with total EPI investment in COVID-19 vaccine development, reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investments for the development of vaccines COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health officer announced that scientists have started six vaccine candidates in animals.
The Imperial College Research of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccines that could amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving a second from Tiongkok.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced a large amount of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at the company and the Canadian University, such as Medicago initiative and the Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced a large amount of C$192 million especially to develop COVID-19 vaccine, with a plan to set up national "vaxin bank" containing some new vaccines that can be used if another coronavirus is happening.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh's University of Dr. Pittsburgh reported the PittCoVacc, COVID-19 Vaxin candidate, on tickets; they said that "MNA that provides subcontracting S1 SARS-CoV-2 produces a potential antibody response [in tissues] which began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Waterloo University Pharmaceutical Faculty announced a DNA-based vaccine design as a potential design.
By using bacteria, DNA was designed to apply in human bacteria to produce non-periodic particulates similar to virus, which could enhance immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industry, and three United States universities gathered a power source to join the IBM supercomputer, combined with the sources of the cloud computation from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have the efficacy of heterological effects, which are also called nonethetic effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit outside the illness.
The trial is further to try to follow 4 170 health workers.
There is probably a vaccine in the development that will not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to review vaccine prosperity using specific animals COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic, other animals, and non-human primates, shows the need for steps to achieve the level 3 of biological security in the maintenance of living virus, and international coordination to determine standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against the SARS and the MERS has been tested on the model of non - human animals.
By 2020, there are no medicines or protection vaccines for the SARS that prove to be safe and effective on humans.
According to the study published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new medicines to treat SARS are the priority for governments and public health worldwide.
When MERS became prevalent, the SARS studies that have been advised can be used to develop vaccine and treatment against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS (based DNA) vaccine that completed the phase I clinical tests on humans, and three other vaccines are in process, which all are virus vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts include conspiracy theory that claims virus back to COVID-19 has already been known and that vaccine has been available.
Patents emphasized by various social media posts died the patent for genetic and vaccine for other coronavirus gallus, such as coronavirus SARS.
(COVID-19) b'Peace coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a disorder disease caused by coronavirus acute inflammation syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The signs of the community were thrown down, rocks, and a sudden pressure.
Other signs may include weakness, nervousness, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, loss of diarrhoea, and pain.
Since the signs were burned up to the most commonly about five days, it was possible to start from two to fourteen days.
Although most of the cases have caused low signals, some have developed a virus pneumonia and a failure.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial regions, which caused more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have been healed, and this virus is generally splitting the interhumanity when a contact occurs nearby, often through a small wheat or a droppet produced through rocks, spins, or when talking.
Though it was done when it was blown, it was usually falling to the ground or to the surface and not to the distance.
Man can also be infected by touching the surface that is contaminated and touching the eyes, the mouth, or the mouth.
In the opposite, this virus can endure for 72 hours.
This virus is very exposed for the first three days after the signal report, although the preach may occur before the signal appears and after the next diagnosis. The standard diagnosis method is with the reaction of the real-time polymerase transcriptisation rate (rRT-PCR) at the nasofaring.
The mask use is encouraged to those who are expected to have a virus and who care for it.
Recommendation on the use of mask by the community differently; some of the authorities agreed that they would not use the mask, some of the reasons for its use, and some of the other deteriorate their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific for COVID-19.
Local illness transmission has been recorded in all countries in six WHO areas.
Some who are infected with virus can be without signs or experience signs such as flu, such as wind, rocks, weakness, and lowness.
Signs of distress include the distress of smoking, breathing or throwing in the cords that continue, confusing, hard to wake up, and faces or whisper; medical inventions are soon recommended if these signs appear.
The signs of the inflammation, such as shining, inflammation, or inflammation, can be severe, but more often occur.
Gastrointestinal signs, such as mood, mood, and diarrhoea, are observed in the percentage of anxiety.
Some cases in Tiongkok first were only with a clinical disorder and palpituation.
In some, sickness can develop pneumonia, defective organs, and death.
This time is called incubase time.
Incubative time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can start from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who are infectioned will experience signs within 11.5 days, and the report shows that not all infections experience signs.
The original evidence shows that they may contribute to the illness preachment.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show any signs yet not known and are being tired, with the Centre of Control and Corea illness (KCDC) reported that 20% of all the cases configured remain without signs during hospital treatment.
The National Health Committee Tiongkok began to describe cases without signs in its case on 1 April; from 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show signs at the test.
Sputs and waters can lead to a large scale of virus.
Speaking with the beasts allows more cocktails or droppes than normally speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered stones could cause dropped to be low to 4,5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not exposed through air, the United States National Scientific Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and the air collection placed in the wheel outside the room of people produces a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubacy and heart intensity (RJP), can make the secret of the inflammation changes to the insult, and they are spread through the air.
Although there is anxiety that the virus can be split through the fees, the risk is decreased low.
The Centre of Europe’s Sickness and Management (ECDC) said that although it was not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one of the people generally infected two to three others. This virus could be able to stay on the surface for hours until the days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on a card/card, up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and cartridge (AISI 304), and up to four hours at 99%.
However, this results depending on weaknesses and weaknesses.
Sodium and detergen are also effective if it is properly used; the seed produces a virus protection, deactivates the virus, and frees it from skin and other surfaces.
Others, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconium chlorohexidine (defective infections), are effective. In an investigation in Hong Kong, the fluid sample was taken in the median two days after the start of the inflammation.
In five of the six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus, and six patients show the highest virus in the second day test.
Coronavirus syndrome of the acute weight 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus of the new weight acute disorder syndrome, which was first isolated from three persons with a scared pneumonia with a classer of acute disorder disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 viruss are on the coronavirus that is in the nature.
Besides the human body, this virus was killed by a householder, which destroyed its protective legs. SARS-CoV-2 was close to the first SARS-CoV.
Paru is the most affected organ of COVID-19 because the virus associates the cells through an enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) change, which is the most increasing in the alveolar cell type II.
This virus uses a special glycoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter cells.
The accurate heart ceder was found at 12% of the infected people who were infectioned in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more frequently in harsh diseases.
Height cardiovascular signals are high because there is a response for systemic inflammation and immune system disorder during the development of diseases, but acute myocard ceder may also be scared by ACE2 receptor in the heart.
Receptor ACE2 diexpress is very high in the heart and involved in the heart function.
Incidence of trombosis (31%) and vena tromboembolism (25%) found in COVID-19 infections in the ICU and may be intimidated with bad prognoses. Automatic in those who died because COVID-19 found the alveolary disorder (DAD) and the inflammacy infiltrate that faces limfosis in the pump.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epitel cells that express ACE2, COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammacy signals.
In particular, T cells, which include GM-CSF patogenic, proved to be co-related with monocytes that include IL-6 inflamators and heavy pearl patology in COVID-19 patients.
Limfosic infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has introduced some test protocols for this disease.
Standard test method is the reaction of the polymerase transcriptase back-time reaction (rRT-PCR).
This trial is usually used in a pattern of destruction that is used through the nasofaring; but it is also possible to use the patterns of the plant or the sceptum.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it needs two blood samples taken by two weeks so that the result has a small amount of time.
The Tiongkok scientists are able to isolate this coronaviral gallure and promote its genetic sequences so that eniuum throughout the world can develop tests of polymerase (PCR) reactions indirectly to detect infections by this virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which can identify active infections and if someone has already been infected) are in developing, but are not much used.
The experience of Tiongkok with the test shows that it is just 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States agreed on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of the month. The diagnostic role written by the Zhongnan University of Wuhan’s disease suggests methods to detect infection based on clinical and epidemiological risks.
The bilateral multi-screen opacity with peripheral distribution, asymetrics, and later many were found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (seven bulls with alveolar supplies) and consolidation can appear in the area of disease development.
A few data are available about microscopic lessons and COVID-19 patofisiology.
The main patological finding of the autopsy is:
Macroscope: pleuris, repicaritis, consolidation of powder, and pulmonary edema
Four species of virus pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyt hyperplasia, big atypic pneumocyte, interstitial inflammation with limfosic infiltracy, and high cell definition
heavy pneumonia: alveolar disorder (DAD) with alveolar exhaust.
DAD is the cause of an aggressive syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemy.
pneumonia in the treatment stage: exhausts in alveolar rings and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation diseminate (DIC); leukoeritroblatic reaction
Steps of prevention to reduce the probability of infection includes staying in the house, avoiding many places, often cutting the hands with a sack and water for at least 20 seconds, implacing the hygiene of a good inflammation, and avoiding touching the eyes, breathing, or mouth with unbridged hands.
CDC recommends closing mouth and closing with tissues when sticks or gins and comments on the use of parts in the cycle if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene’s hands are suitable after the rocks or the spins are instructed.
The CDC admits that the use of the face closing of the cabinet in the public, a part of limiting the shopping by people without signs. The social statement is intended to reduce the contact of people infected with many people, in order to close school and workplace, to limit traveling, and to cancel the large scale meetings in the public.
It also includes a guardian of at least 6 feet or 1,8 meters.
There are no medicines that are not known effectively preventing COVID-19.For vaccine has not been anticipated until beginning 2021, the main part of COVID-19 is trying to decrease the epidemic point, which is known as "creasing curve".
The CDC also agreed that people often cut their hands with a bathroom and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands appear to be cool, before eating, and after buying the feed, the rocks, or the kitchen.
Moreover, the CDC also agreed to use a basic alcohol service that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when the water and water are not available. In the area that commercial hands are not available, the WHO provides two forms for local production.
In this formula, antimicrobial activity originated from etanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help lose bacteria tracks in alcohol; this is "not active for hand antisepsis".
Gliserol was cast as humid.
People are treated with support care, which can include oxide, oxygen support, and support other vital organs.
The CDC agreed to those who believed they were bringing virus to use a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane oxidation (ECMO) has been used to cope with the failure of the inflammation, but its benefit is still considered.
The cleanness, lifestyle, and healthy food are expected to increase immunity.
The supportive care may be used for those who have low signals at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Commission of National Health Tiongkok have issued a recommendation to handle the COVID-19 news on the inap.
An intensive career and experts in the United States have added recommendations from various bodies to free sources, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there are no specific medicines for COVID-19.
For signs, some of the medical households are more common than parasetamol (asetaminofen) than ibuprofen for the first line.
Preventions must be taken to minimize the risk of virus exhausts, especially in health care requirements when making a procedure that can result, such as intubacy or hand ventilation.
For a health career that cares for the COVID-19, the CDC recommended that the person is placed in the Tular-Udara Infections Area, other than using standard preventive actions, contact preventions, and interactions. CDC granted a request for the use of self-defense tools (APD) during the pandemics.
The device that is intended is: APD, respirator or face mask, eyes protection, and medical hands. If available, the respirator (not face mask) is better.
N95 respirators are accepted for industrial authorities, but the FDA has authorised this mask to be used on the basis of the Darurat Use Authorisation (USA).
The N95 respirator was designed to protect from particulates of air carrying like dust, but the efficiency against certain biologist agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned in the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC will accept it to use a face protector or, as the last effort, its own building mask.
Most of the cases COVID-19 are not too hard to need mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are weak.
The type of inflammatory support for those who experience a failure of the fearful COVID-19 is active for those who are busy, and there are evidence that intubacy can be avoided by a high-alliation canel or the pressure of bi-effective air pressure.
We do not know whether one of these two methods has the same benefit for those who are sick.
Some doctors are more likely to use invasive mechanical ventilation when they are available, because this technology is limited to the publicity of particular particulates, compared to the high-aliased canel. A more weighty case occurs at age (one who is over 60 years old, and mostly the age of 80).
Many developing countries have no place of sleeping in the hospital, which limits the health capacity of the health system to handle ships suddenly the number of COVID-19 cases quite hard so that it needs an inflammation.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% in intensive care units, 2.3% need mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, approximately 30% of the COVID-19 newspapers cared at the end of the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation has become more complicated in the ARDS-Acceptive syndrome and the oxygenisation has become more difficult in COVID-19.
Ventilators who are able to make pressure control mode and high EP are required to maximize oxygen oxide once minimize the risk of ceder and pneumotoracs of the most painful ventilator.
The high EP may not be available on an old ventilator.
In January 2020, some antiviral medicines are being tested.
It seems to be the most promised.
Although new medicines may take time until 2021, some tested medicines have been accepted for other uses or have been conducted in the next study.
Antiviral diseases can affect people who have distressed diseases.
The WHO reporters have been able to follow the test of potential treatment and the safety of potential treatment. The FDA has given a temporary authorisation for the convalency plasma as a experimental survey in the case of life of a person very or so-called.
Plasma convalency has not yet conducted clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok dropped the cellular application to handle this disease.
User is requested to enter their name and ID.
This application can detect 'contact close' using survey data so that it can detect the potential of infection risk.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, the application is not only compromised by the karantine, but also with the local health worker. The phone data analysis, face knowledge, phone tracking, and building understanding is used to track people infected and contacted with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government allowed the security body to track the phone data of those who claimed to be translated to Coronavirus.
The step was taken to meet the karantine and to protect those who may contact the infectioned citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the local data agregates to the German Federal Government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the virus preachment.
The Russian uses faced knowledge to identify the karantine engineer.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that he was given to the phone operator that "40% of the citizens still moved to the place".
The German government has made the end of Thursday 48 hours with more than 42,000 people.
Moreover, the president of Estonia, Christmas Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solution against the Coronavirus preacher.
Man can experience pressure from karantine, traveling, sickness, or fear of the infection.
BBC commented on Rory O'Connor who said, "Increase social isolation, singleness, health concerns, stress, and economic worstness is a perfect body that threatens mental health and society health."
This illness can continue with a little or without a sign, which is similar to the illness of illness, such as pills.
In two weeks, the bad case may be healed, while the sick or criticians may need three to six weeks to cure.
Pregnancy women may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still less. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the powder so that it causes pneumonia.
In the most severe person, COVID-19 can quickly develop to a acute inflammation syndrome (ARDS) that causes deficiencies, sectical sugars, or mature organs.
The terrible complication with COVID-19 includes sepsis, abnormal blood tumor, and harm in heart, genial, and heart.
Blood bleeding, especially protrombin time-building, has been seen by 6% of the COVID-19 patients who are cared for insults, while the value of the genial function appears to 4% of these pumps.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 enzymes show the enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between signs and death was ten days, and five days were spent in the wind.
However, the patient moved to the ICU has seven days of mediators between the cloud and the death.
In a study investigating early cases, the median time begins from the beginning signal to the death was 14 days, with the full of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have 2.8% death dead, while women have 1.7% death.
Histopatological examination of the postmortem powder shows the alveolar disorder was flooded with the fibromicsoide exhaust in the two pumps.
Sitopatic changes have been observed on pneumocytes.
Included in the ARDS, the ARDS is a syndrome of an accurate inflammation.
In 11,8% of the death reported by the National Health Commission Tiongkok, the heart disorders were observed, with a troponein survival or a stop of heart.
According to maret data from the United States, 89% of those who are concerned have the conditions of carrying out the medical and social economy can also affect the mortality.
Thinking of mortality from a condition is a result of the differences in the area, but also of methodological challenges.
At least a decreasing case may cause the dead to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is a result of the past cases that can mean that the mortality is too low.
Perukok has the probability of 1,4 times greater experiences the COVID-19 signs and about 2,4 times more likely to need intensive or deadly than those who are not perforated. There are anxieties about this disease's long-term.
The Hong Kong Sickness Authority found a 20%-30% capabilities in some who are ill-in-law, and the powder shows the organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome of anti-inflammation after healing.
Until March 2020, an infection is not yet known if an effective immunity is given to those who have been cured from this disease.
Immunity may be obtained if you see another coronavirus behaviour, but it has been reported that there was a case of COVID-19 health followed with a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case was determined to be a worst infection, not a repeated infection.
This virus was deemed natural and originated from animals through diluting infections.
In fact, it is not known, but in December 2019, the preacher of the infections of the blast was increasingly inspired by the escape of humans to humans.
A study about 41 cases of the first COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of the first sign of the newspaper was 1 December 2019.
WHO’s research publishers reported the first magazine on December 8, 2019.
In general, some of the designs were used to calculate mortality.
This is based on areas and time, and affected by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, the options of control, the time of the first, and the character of population such as age, gender, and health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO sets the ICD-10 disease code of U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 infection configured and U07.2 for the death of COVID-19 diagnosised clinically or epidemiologically without confission for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death ratio against the case indicates the number of deaths divided by the diagnostic cases in the period specified.
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the death ratio against the case was 6,9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number of persons who died from certain diseases, and the IFR fatality, which represented the percentage of infected (diagnosis and nondiagnosis) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics haven't been timeful and followed by certain populations begin from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone infected with antibodies, antibodies can provide information about the number of infected ones.
In the Italian widow episode, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, this disease is translated through the Karnaval festival, which divides to young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 death.
Moreover, the German health system has not yet been reliable.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of the population may have an antibodies, such as the blood donor.
69 people (0.004% of the population) died because of COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemics and the effects of his mortality are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher than men in the study of Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the risks between men and new women not appear at the age of 90.
In Tiongkok, the death of a man was 2,8 per cent and 1,7 per cent for a woman.
The reason for distinguishing this genetic kind is not known, but the genetic factor and behaviour may be a reason.
Immunological differences are based on gender, prevalence is lower to women, and men who have comfort, such as hypertension, can contribute to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% of those died because COVID-19 are men.
By April 2020, the U.S. Governments did not track the most scared gender data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
Percentage of health employees who volunteer women to be higher, especially sisters, and they have a higher opportunity to burn virus.
World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is a coronary condition, VI for virus, D for illness, and 19 for the first time that is identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to a specific geografic location (e.g. Tiongkok), species of animals, or a group of people, with international security recommendations that prevent stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is given the name of coronavirus acute disorder syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "Virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Good disease and lazym virus is called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and the disease are called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO concluded that 2019-nCoV and acute 2019-nCov disease as a temporary name for virus and illness according to 2015-based farmers who did not use local names in the name of disease and virus.
The name of the COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on 11 February 2020.
Since the ability limits in the standard armies are limited, some digital producers disrupt health cares, such as natural and ventilator components.
In one example, when a Italian hospital needs very much ventilator cats, and the engineer can't give it in the necessary time scale, a local company's back and cut 100 cats that were needed in the evening.
At the beginning of the COVID-19, the theory of conspiration, the basic information, and the information has been informed about origin, scale, precaution, treatment, and other aspects of diseases, which spread quickly.
Man seems to be able to put virus into some other animals.
Couldn't find evidence of the virus replication on the bovine, wheat, and yellow.
There are no medicines or vaccines accepted to treat this disease.
International investigation on vaccines and COVID-19 medicines is held by government organizations, academics, and industrial researchers.
In March, World Health Organization negotiated "SOLIDARITY Trial" for the effect of the four antivirus treatment that already exists with the most promising honour.
The vaccine has not yet been available, but many are active to develop vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were also using ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategy that are being tied.
First, the researcher was intended to make the primary virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, well inactive or dead virus, is intended to quickly make the response of human body immunity against the new COVID-19 infection.
Secondly, subunit vaccine is intended to create vaccine that makes immune systems sensitive to certain virus sub-units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on S-spike proteins that helped virus to adjust ACE2 enzymes receptor.
Third is the nuclear sulphur vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, new vaccination technology).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinic test of a vaccine starts with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinic tests running in April 2020.
Seven tests tested to evaluate the medicines accepted for malaria, include four studies against oxychlorocuine or chlorocuine.
The new purpose of the antivirus testing of Tiongkok represents a large number of studies, with nine tests of Phase III at remdesivir in some countries with the time of reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dynamic development of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 medicines are already available.Several antiviral medicines are being evaluated for COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorocuin and ́oxychlorocuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was a timely evidence of remdesivir advantage.
The clinical advertising has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir in oral treatment.
Fase III clinic tests are in the United States, Tiongkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, telitised in Tiongkok in February 2020.
Yet, there is a call for anxiety against the rice.
Corean Health Authority and Tiongkok agreed on the use of chlorocuine.
However, the Institute of Virology Wuhan, although considering the daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is two times very dangerous and possible.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation for use of water for oxychlorocuine and chlorocuine for the doctor's policy careing for COVID-19.The 7-Editional Tiongkok domain also designated interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data show that the high dose of ribavirin is required to cause SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanida has been designed for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Penelitian indicates that the initial premixing against proteins is highly important for the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2 receptor.
In relation to chlorocuine and ́oxychlorocuine with or without azitromycin, the major limits that have prevented medical communities to use this treatment without further studies. Oseltamivir does not affect SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no role known in the COVID-19 treatment.
Sitokin body complication can happen at COVID-19 a further step.
There are evidence that ́oxychlorokuin may have an anticytokine. Tocilizumab has been introduced into the medication investigation by the National Health Committee Tiongkok after a small survey has been completed.
This site is conducting the 2th phase test at the national stage in Italy after showing the positive results of people with disorder diseases.
Combined with the nervous blood test to identify the sitokin body, this medicine was intended to combat the sytokine, which was expected to be a cause of death to some who were seen.
In 2017, antagonism of interleukin-6 receptor was approved by FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of the sytokin steroid refractor syndrome, which was induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there are no evidence that show that tocilizumab is a genuine treatment for CRS.
Transfers of antibodies that are cleaned and inspected by the system of people who have been healed from COVID-19 to those who need it are tired as a method of nonvaxin passiv immunisation.
This has been tested for SARS with unconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a working mechanism expected for passive antibodies terapies can provide defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellulary sitotoxicity depending on antibodies and/or fagositosis, may also be possible.
For other passive antibodies, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced in development.
Convalency, which is a part of the blood of patients who have been healed and have a specific antibody against this virus, can be solved for a faster use.
Coronavious illness, a scared syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor in the Center Wuhan Hospital, who then died because of COVID-19 after dismissing the conscience of the virus preacher.
