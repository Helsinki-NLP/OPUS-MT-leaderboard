Prague storm falls into negative at the end of the trade
After the early fall, the press storm corrected the losses.
Transactions with the CHEZ shares have reached the half of the current daily trade.
The Prague storm was immediately on the beginning of the Tuesday negotiation to its Sunday pass, when it lost about six percent.
This time after the decline is a fall of action on Wall Street.
We also show the market reaction to the results of the vote of the American Sneam representatives, which refused to support the stabilising plan of the dark financial sector.
Action Path in Asia
The dramatic fall on Wednesday, even though the indexs had finally been deleted during the day.
The Index Hang Seng bulls in Hong Kong decreased at least four percent during the trade, but the loss part was deleted and reduced to approximately 2.5 per cent.
Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, who follows the movement of Chinese actions in Hong Kong, decreased by 3.8 per cent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
The bourgeois in Sydney lost more than five percent, but the loss finally decreased to 4.3 percent.
The bourgeois on Thai-wan, according to the dark index, decreased by 3.6 percent.
"The time of the salvation action in the United States is uncertain, but it's the financial markets worldwide," observed Hungarian Monetary Authority Chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, defines its monetary policy individually, thus without delay the Chinese centrality.
The tax rates of Hong Kong have the same level as the United States.
The American legislators, according to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, should return to negotiations and approve the support of the financial system.
Others think that it's dangerous that the effects will be felt by other countries.
Blood lake of America's action
The United States Sneam representatives refused the financial system support plan on Monday to be charged up to 700 billion dollars (this is 12 billion Kč).
The lawmakers ignored the invitation of President George Bushe to support the plan.
According to Bushe, the plan would resolve the fundamental causes of financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
America's action on Monday has experienced blood lacation and main action indexs have changed the largest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index decreased by seven percent, and in a similar range, it mentioned the results in 1987.
The index had fallen before the vote, but as soon as it was shown that he didn't pass us in sleep, the index felt in a free fall.
Congress departed: The US government can pump 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of the United States Congress and the Government of President George W. Bushe agreed on a larger form of the financial aid agreement for the US financial system.
The vote on him will be the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators acted in discussions on the approval of a salvation plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, the win is not yet.
The Congressmans have to complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of law and vote on it.
The financial system's support plan will be negotiated on the ground of the Summit representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the President of the Bank Committee and the Financial Service of Barney Frank said that.
According to the resources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan first in the middle.
According to the economics, it should be notified that the approval of the salvation plan is to take place, the first significant psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
However, there will be "screening" through the complexity of the mechanisms that can help markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be aware
"We made a big progress.
We have resolved our distant opinions about how the pattern is to look like to stabilize the market," said the Democracy Nancy Pelosi for the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be reached on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators met the US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson on Monday night to give a final form of the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies an unsealable hypothetical assets that download financial undertakings to difficult losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the continuation of the definitive agreement of the plan that will work and must also be on the market.
There's still a healthy plan to continue, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is extremely affected by the actions markets that decreases.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reida, the lawmakers are trying to reach the definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They also want to quiet investments before negotiating the Asian financial markets, which are the first timeline in which the decision of Congress could affect Monday trade.
However, there is still no doubt when both of the United States Congress will vote on the law, nor whether negotiations can be able to deal with such a problem at the last time.
The legislators hope that he will be approved in the next few days.
However, the Law still knows a number of changes.
The total amount intended for the system assistance shall be divided into two parts.
Initial 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as the President George Bush requested.
Congress, however, can block the rest of the amounts if it will have the idea that the program does not fill its own, and it will be the next $100 billion and the final $350 billion.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations
Although the president may make this decision known, the Congress can vote on his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was obtaining funds for the redemption of bad hypothetical valuable papers, whose value was lost, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were not able to pay their hypoteques, remained.
"We worked everything.
Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and Senat on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress in negotiation is also satisfied by the American President Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto announced that Bush is satisfied with the Sabbath progress and appreciates "the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economies".
Constraints of gold falls
The President of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, leader of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money programme, the protection of tax chargers from loss, the closed impact, the financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the golden falls for the directors of the company and establish a committee to monitor the fund.
It should be the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked on this very strong and made a great progress towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan is also calculated by helping the owners of households who have problems with payment.
The government should deal with new payments for the hypothecs they buy, with a view to reducing monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to leave their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance David Mark's main economy, but it will be very difficult but its implementation.
"And it is because it doesn't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will be sold.
This will be a determining way to divide the loss of the financial sector and the government among themselves," he said this week for the iHNed.cz Mark server.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, Mark is not so important.
"The more important is that the congressmen agree that this plan is supported for this week and that they will dedicate it as soon as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement to be approved is the most important at this moment," Mark stressed.
MP3 MP3 players against mobile.
We'll advise how to choose
While each mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can't phone.
It seems that it's better to buy only a phone.
Yet, there are enough things to arrange a single player.
The choice depends completely on the way of use and the benefits of the future owner.
You're probably hard to arrange a nice grammophone home to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such musical products on the LP tables are not included and there are neither any objects in a quality view for it.
However, if you are tired in your rules with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream at least about such grammophone.
It's the same with music on the roads, so music compressed, simply - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For someone it may be unacceptable to lose for a player eight thousand crowns, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, sometimes hardly testing the hearer for twenty corones from the market.
Two extréms between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Determines the maintenance of the battery
Some speech music players will be able to do much more than just playing music, but what the rate of mobile or accidentally.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
According to primary, telephone and exemescation, it can play music and video, both play, have a better, worse camera, and maybe it can navigate.
And when we take smartphony and communications, you'll have a little computer in the capsule.
It's a little miracle, no cheese can grill, and no television doesn't photograph.
Mobile universality also brings advantages.
As much as you use the mobile, the indicator on the screen will send you to the buyer.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy worries.
The small mobile can play music longer than ten twelve hours, mostly it's much less.
In this direction, music players (in particular the most simple) are far more effective.
That's why you can calculate that for more than a few hours they will play you.
You're still here, and you're calling there, bring you to the work for security -- it's also applicable to the dearest devices.
In MP3 players you will have this problem, and those worst will hold at least 9 hours of uncontinued operation on one shopping.
Another problem occurs when moving music into the mobile.
Unfortunately, only the part of the devices is available to the USB Universal Conctor, and not each of them can be directly connected to a computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a small read card can be consulted without reduction with miniature memory cards that are used in the mobile.
For players to exception (iPod) you don't want any special software.
A sufficed device to fill with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile and players already create a music book classified by the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the need to evaluate.
Some devices only show the tree structure of directories like a Windows Explorer and some can both (—Ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operational system).
Player's hands are handled, mobiles are more skillful
When selecting a specific device, consider the maintenance of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If your music is primarily a bathroom, and if you listen to it every day only shortly in a tramvay, you'll have enough any mobile that plays MP3.
That's what it's already able to do about any phone.
You don't have too much to follow the music formats of the mobile or player.
MP3 will be able to all and the complete music that will get to you will just be in this format.
It belongs to the most extensive and other than it is the full number of devices that can also be able to play music in the WMA format.
The AAC is less produced (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also enables for example buying online music.
It's enough through the mobile Internet to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or another provider) and a song or album to buy.
This service could already be a fatal argument for the installation of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is mixed and is limited only to the ≥quassed hitio.
The prices are also not less.
However, generally, it is assumed that this way of sale of music (whatever GSM, Internet or free internet) is to be in the future.
Mobile number of people are still wearing with themselves.
Whenever you get a pleasure to listen to something, you take the mobile in the capsule while the MP3 player lies forgotten home.
However, it still depends on whether you also have a hearer or at least a handsfree with you.
No, you can use an integrated player who has at least every mobile, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Maybe the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be for many prices.
The most important are running under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you're already ordering a very good walkman.
However, most of you will limit the absency of output to running listeners.
The best and at the technical page, the most furious phones, and with 3,5 mm boxes for running listeners, are 15 thousand.
The outcome of players is, outside the other, easy service.
The most simple - not necessarily the most important (see our choice) - players will be able to control the truth everyone.
Minimum, the likeness of control with an earlier running boxer or the grammophone is obvious.
It does not threaten colises in the form of a mistake of a mobile Internet enabled, and then the data transfer.
Which device to compose
Even the most important mobile (e.g. Vodafone 527) has a layer on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD apod.).
Even by purchasing the appropriate card, you'll enter two thousand coroners.
But take care of it.
Basic models supported only cards with maximum capacity 2 GB.
Only the most dear guys can advise 8 GB memories.
You already have a mobile and you still want to buy a leaving MP3 player, go after Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irirever.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not lose more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to the more detailed listeners, take rai after specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have a single control button for MP3 and the comfort of the management is so close to the individual MP3 player.
The next time, there is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from a series of walkman have the same interface as sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (to 16 GB) and maintains the battery (left 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) will bring you MP3 players from the above tags.
The operator will come to Czech in the year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechland is relatively developed and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet, we miss something here -- an operator that would make those classicals delight.
Maybe it's missing.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most dear in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
It has recently confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than in the remainder of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the Roaming Payment Regulation as possible, the paradoxation - for some Czech Mobile Operators, SMS will be more lower than home.
How is it possible that prices in Czech are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, the lack of competition that would really want to go into the battle.
Maybe it sounds paradox, we have three mobile networks and penetration over 100%.
Instead, mobile operators demand that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, the President of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTU) of the Czech Office is often invoked by Paul the Divorce, who in the past stated that there is no place for another operator in Czech.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has no longer too many chances (only, it would only have been hard to search for frequency).
But there's another option - a operator.
Just entered the mobile market operators brought a significant decrease of prices to which the classic operators had to respond.
On the other hand, before the income of the shock, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, the similar voices in the United Kingdom were found in us.
But it was shown that the place for such operators is and that they can be successful.
We don't have to walk too far for examples.
In February of the year, we informed you about the start of the Mobilking Operator in Poland.
In only a half years, this operator was able to obtain more than 100 thousand clients and to become the darkest fifth largest operator.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Pent's financial group is located in Czechland, other than U:fona.
The benefit of the operators is the opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, they have much less clients than a classic operator.
They do not carry with themselves relatively high costs for building, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, such opponents are usually profiled as low-quality - offers leaving calls and SMSs, which is often exported by a favorable service offer.
So Tesco Mobile in British will offer SMS at least half less than his competitors.
However, as shows the example of Mobilking in Poland, it may be a very good move and a demand for an unexpected target group.
This operator also intends specifications for men.
"The administrative guys choose Mobilking - a operator who loves and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this operating operator.
It's hard to say if a similar concept like in Poland could be captured by us.
It doubts the print speaker Vodafon Miroslav Čepisk: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which the majority of operators are found.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in view of the service offer."
In Czech without chance, mobile operators are called
But it seems to be sure that if there's a mobile operator in Czech, it's Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project in Czechland, but it does not seem too strict.
Moreover it will come to the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studenčová, the printing group of Penta.
She immediately confirmed that existing mobile operators in Czech had not been absolutely claimed to this idea.
Instead, he's trying to do everything so that no potential competitor has been destroyed.
Interesting the launch of a mobile operator has no longer been made by GTS Nover, which would like to make a further step to become the real competitor of the O2 Telephone on fire customers field.
"We have great interest in it, and our customers could offer not only strong, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And that's what I've been before, that's better.
We reacted on this option with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to continue in negotiations," says the printing speaker group of Paul Kaidl.
So maybe it's a better time.
Official information seems to be expected at the end of the year by the first operating operator.
In the meantime, however, his appearance is conducting an unexpected silence building.
"In this moment, we don't think there's a space on the Czech market for the appearance of a full-valuable operator.
The Czech market is very specific for other markets.
Until no entity with a complex and serial project in this face," he stated in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Shenn from the O2 Printing Committee.
The specificity of the Czech market is revoked by other operators.
The press speaker T-Mobilu Martin Kemr adds rarely to the O2: "We have not yet registered any life-capacity and ambiguous business project that could continue to build."
And adds, "In the T-Mobilu network, a hard operator will appear until the end of the year.
At this point, they had to have a specific agreement on the table so that it could be considered in this short horizon."
Wodafone takes its attention rather than to comply with its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepski says: "We are opened with potential operators, especially in the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
It's just what we're thinking about as the most beneficial clients.
The Vodafon Strategy in this area is to find a partner for the building of a shared network for the mobile Internet."
Responsible Authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition, leading to low prices and also to decrease their profits.
Why, then, make such a competitor easier?
The fact that when the operators are about something, they're going to get to one testimony, witnesses and tachynicas around the U:fone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards TTU went in the time of U:fona from T-Mobile.
It testifies publicly accessible information from the TITU website.
But now U:phone is just like a argument why the operator doesn't allow.
Martina Kemr's subcontracted: "The competition of the mobile market was recently strengthened by the input of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the TR, it is evident that the entrance of another player would place high requests on its services."
In view of this access to mobile operators, however, it is directly injurious to the entire interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
However, it is not only about the position of the CTU, which, unfortunately, was in Czechland - from the Great Britain and other developing countries - it has no power to enter into the economic competition.
These belong exclusively to the Economic Concurrence Agency (OCDE).
But the one who was aware of his typical position to the whole problem.
"The entrance of the mobile market operator would be possible after closing the connection between the mobile operator and the needed infrastructure operator.
No such commitment has been closed afterwards because the offer of potential interesters was probably not interesting enough for classic operators," he said in the answer to our question Christian Chalupa from the UOHS Committee on External Relations.
It is probably not surprised by the representatives of the operators.
From the office to represent the interests of the employers and otherwise, even if no one does not use his market position, it is more than on the burden.
In particular, when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the place where the operators are working running, we can note that their market income has contributed to decreasing prices for mobile phone services."
It is obvious that the pressure for the correct functioning of the market and the price decrease does not belong to the interests of the UOHS.
In the truth, the whole case is a fascinating concept of three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is, if it's just the case, it's offered to be completely alone.
Like totally the same price of benzine in shopping stations, it is certainly only the part of the accident and strong competitive fight.
"The Authority in this matter did not seek signs of antisocial proceedings, and thus it does not have a way to include.
None of the operators has a dominant position, thus does not have a higher responsibility for his market transactions.
The needed tools for the opening of the mobile market for air operators are soon as to the telecommunication regulator," Chalupa stated in his expression.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
It is understandable that an analysis of the relevant markets is developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications are based on the economic competition on the only market.
On such market, of course, no of the Czech operators has dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer another view - to the result of the operator, it is necessary to agree with the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has a whole logic - on his monopol network.
So in a certain segment, it must be dominant.
Even when they did not admit these arguments, the UOHS should be at least warning that three mobile operators act in the same way.
In addition, the complaints of a series of interesters (including GTS Novera) indicate that in negotiating with all operators, they are very similar barriers.
In the telecommunications, then, the responsibility is a relatively covered truck that UOHS gives from all the matter of hand.
We've met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in recently adopted new telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of the CTU to the economic competition in telecommunications was not able to claim whether a number of experts had been promised to improve.
This must be more than good, but obviously their interests are elsewhere.
That's what's going on when nobody's looking at
However, there remains no attention to the operation of some pseudo-virtual operators that exist in the Czech mobile networks immediately.
They are firms who issue their own prices of mobile phone services, but are public only partly.
It is usually a multilevel marketing company.
Your own mobile phone services will offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these fires are usually getting only to the chosen ones.
Kouzlo causes the company against the operator to come as a classic fire customer, who is charged with a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client then will receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that trade submissions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibiting similar re-selling.
"When the cases you're talking about were made, it could be about the violation of contractual subcontracts that were concerned and that could run in the end of cooperation with the company," answered Martin Kemr's question to this problem.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity would not be caused by the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of three fires mentioned, there may be thousands of clients.
None of the operators will then prevent such procedures.
From the activities of these fires, they have inevitable profits, and, in turn, they are - in the range of the operators - they are not threatening their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk warns for problems: "The Law allows similar speculations, however, the services of these fires are only using a depreciable percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not conducted to their name, so they cannot be fully available with it as running customers of mobile operators."
But it should be at least strange.
Furthermore, the UOHS question will be opened.
If mobile operators arise over the similar procedure of the eyes, why are they blocking the appearance of the operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has a relatively strong power to discover similar activities, and if they want, it does not have to satisfy the interpretation of operators that they have no idea and their trade submissions are prohibited.
When We're the Best
As the text has already fallen sometimes, the mobile market income operators has brought a significant reduction in the price for service.
Instead, practices in all countries where the operators had appeared were trying to protect the classic operators more or less.
The arguments used by Jimi were practically identical - too small, if possible too saturated market, services quality problems, etc.
In developing countries, however, just at these moments, regulatory authorities, who have never seen the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Any official or non-formal pressure has been achieved by the first operator and have been packed on.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities overcome the whole case as a warm port.
From our experience, we can not be able to avoid the idea that inaccuracy in the skills they are more than they can.
But we don't put the flint into the wheat.
The legitimate information is the correct and rational operator will really come to us soon, the Czech mobile market may be renewed.
Some operators have admitted an existing mobile operator, but the UOHS will only be able to remain inappropriate to deny (discrimination) other interesters.
And we should stop calling the road before the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymna has four new versions.
Choose the best here
Listen to four implementations of the new version of the Czech State Hymna.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech State Day presented new records of the State Hymney where my house is.
Hymnu newly burned the orchestra of the National Division under the lead of Jiří's White Header.
There are four versions - with a man or woman sole song in the congregation and instrumental versions.
The song was captured by Catherine the priest and Adam Plachet.
The writers of the hymns are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Church.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The white headquarters view the Czech National Song as one of the most beautiful hymen.
The Czech vote already said that he had chosen intendedly to sing salt variants with young representative voices, which are significant and favorite.
"From the beginning, I went to both, and then he tried to take care of the congregation to have a dictionary, so that the text was well understanding to understand," he said.
The Czech State Hymna will celebrate 175 years.
Song Where my house was the first place in 1834 on the Ladies of the Station Division in the p ́n Czech Game Fidlovačka Joseph Cayetán Tyla supplemented by the French Schroup music.
She got popularity, and people took it spontaneously for their own.
The song then became a natural part of the national hymne after the presentation of the Czech Republic in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the presentation of the Czech Republic.
How the "new" himna sounds
Prague MHD in the middle of the first connection and on the chip
Middle 1 October 2008, it will be written into the Prague Transport Undertaking as the date on which the first tram and bus travellers will be replaced instead of the paper carriers in the box of the electron cupon.
It can arrange about a hundred thousand people at this point who own the Opencard Chips card.
Travellers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual bathroom (they will pay from 1 January 2009) and allow them to record on their cheap card in the information centres and workshops of transport business in the events of the metro Museum, Mostek, Holesho, Angel, Roztyly, Sovietians, Kobilisy, Raining Garden, Cachers and Luke.
Company can also be bought via the Internet since yesterday on the Website of the Transport Undertaking www.dpp.cz.
The service used over four hundred customers in the afternoon hours.
Those who are going to use the Internet trading can definitively forget the outcome window in the meter stations where they have to stay regularly in long fronts on paper boxes.
The purchases purchasing the Internet and on the Opencard card they play it in one of the thirteen sides of the City Book.
"In these places there is a traveler with a trained service that helps interesters to purchase the Internet and also replaces the purchased cupon on their card," said the speaker project Martin Watchful.
Along with the book, you can also load electronic buyers on Opencard in self-service machines which are installed in a number of meters.
How's these machines looking like?
They're red, they're on the travellers, and travelers may have already seen them in the metro rostyla, Boyovicka, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vlatavska.
"Now they are five in the city, but at the end of the year they should be eighty," added the Watchful.
Cupon automatically checks the driver's location
The management of automotives that will run tomorrow is easy.
It's enough to insert the opencard card in them and the previously paid cupon will be replaced on it.
Electronic buyes from tomorrow are not only in the main city but also in its areas.
Then, in the households and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, leading to the main city, most people of the Mediterranean communities.
"In the flags enclosed in the Prague integrated transport, they are increasingly equipped by the readers of cards, which determine the time and pseudo validity of the kupons," he explained the control of the Philip Drapal leader from the Ropid organization, which consists of the leading lines of the Prague crop transport.
The car rental buses have cards readed in the board at the driver's cart.
So when you come, it is not only necessary to show the driver's digital card, but it is also necessary to attach Opencard to the specified location on the side of the staff.
This driver is checking the validity of the backup buckets.
"When the traveling is to verify the validity of uploaded cups, there is nothing easier than requesting the driver about these information," Drapal added.
Travellers who don't eat buses and remember when they end their loop, can go back to self-service cars where they are bought on a card.
The information on the validity of their documents will be shown in the display of the device.
Sudetes wanted the United States referendum
In 1945, the Judean Germans requested the entrance of Shumava to the United States.
It comes from the letter that is stored in the collections of the Southern Book.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Russia, we want at least to live under the pattern of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans returned to the president of the United States with such a desire.
This includes a letter that has been maintained in a private and is currently stored in the assemblies of the Southern Book.
Germans from the Czech Krumlva requested in letters of the American President not to allow the return of the "shumaw jungle" - prohibited by Hitler on the basis of the Mnich Agreement - back to Czech Slovenia.
"We have understanded the right and we want to be certain of the words that the American units are in the German territory, not as the enemies and enemies, but as the liberators," it is written in the letter signed by the word "The people who are in the heart of the Court of Shumava."
Since the connection to Czech Slovenia is evidently given to the Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech National Powers - only for brutality, invisibleness, incomprehension, attack and irregularity, the authors of the American president's letter to take a protector over Schuma for the present and lasting time.
"We can't believe that you would have recognised this territory without regard to the view of a fourth million inhabitants to a foreign country, who presses and rejects minorities and nothing, but has not contributed to the winning of the United States," it is written in the letter.
And why the authors can't sign, it's evident that it's due to the vengeance of the "Czech attackers".
The President of the United States would evidently doubt about the thinking of the Germans of the Smuggle, enough to organize a referendum in the Smuggling Chapter on whether its people want to be part of the United States or to live under the pattern of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can sound a little naive in today's knowledge of the military, some memories advise the expectation of the Sude Germans appropriately.
Although the Czech Germans needed at least to think that it would be their discharge from the Republic, only a few of them have permitted that opportunity at all.
Some expected the United States and the Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy to the Judges.
Others believed they would just stay in Czech Slovenia.
It also confirms the glorious Russian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Buèvich.
He was for wars as a buiow German set up for the Balt sea.
When the Brits captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holland, the tens of the rest of the Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they'd be able to walk," said Chalup.
No of the German prisoners who lived before war in Czech Republic, according to the fact that it would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Benes Decrees.
You don't think, you're paying!
Emoti’s campaign attacks the driver
The most dear action is focused on safety on the streets in the Czech Republic.
Even so, it would be possible to characterize emotions of the media campaign that it decided to start the Ministry of Transport in the middle.
The Office of Ministers of Aleshe Rebecca promises her to deliver drivers from the dangerous behaviour of the voice.
The campaign in 150 million will be shown in television, division, cinema, on the Internet, and even on the aircraft.
She should take the driver away from the ≥ head and alcohol after the caller.
And remind them to be admitted before they go out.
He wants to be aware of young drivers, engines, walkers, and professional drivers, especially.
And what's going on in the spot?
The main human history that attacks emotions.
And the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think, you're paying!
The word "n't think" is written by large letters on a speed.
And in the blood caluge there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can pay his own life for the choice of unnecessaryness.
The villages will "fry" meetings until 2010.
The Ministry was allowed to be inspired by anxiety campaigns in England, where images with drastic images of accidents can be seen running.
He promises that the accident and the number of dead in the Czech roads are so decreased.
The Euro RSCG Agency prepared meetings.
Sugar and bottle on drivers
"The driver's paying sugar and bottle system.
The sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to the red, it takes time.
It's a threat of repentance or accident.
The drivers must be risked," says the transport psychologist of the hospital on Homolce Martin Kořán.
That is why information campaigns need printing and mainly negative advertising, less psychological.
There are already less effects in accordance with tables that warn drivers of danger.
"When a statistical table is installed that warns against dangers, it is probably quickly coming with the road and the drivers will eat," Koran warned.
Olmert would almost return all the occupied territory in exchange for peace
The President of the temporary Israeli Government Ehud Olmert expressed the return of the practice of all the territory occupied in 1967, so also the Pre-Jordan, the East Jerusalem and the Golan Height, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did that in a conversation that printed Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to return to the agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return to all (obtained) territory, unless all of us," Olmert said the journal.
"We have a certain percent of these territory, but the Palestinians are going to have to have a similar percentage (the land of Israel) because without the peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially not wants tractors or bulldozers to take his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the defeat of two July attacks in the city, where several people were killed and ten people were hurt.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, holy and historical places", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It's going to work," he stressed.
Department from Golan Height
Olmert also expressed the department of Israel from the Golan Height, which is, according to an unrepentant undermining for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also require certain efforts from Damasc.
"I don't want to close the peace with Syria only on the basis of the Golan department," he warned.
"The Syrians will well know what they will have to be delivered to get Golana.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give their relationship with (the shit movement) Hizballáh; they will have to give permanent support to the terrorism (the shit movement) Hamás, (the terrorist network) Al-Kajdy and jahada (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after accident: are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking in a remote bus can't be.
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padva, the question was whether stewards and travellers could be moved after the bus.
"When they wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of stewards is in contrast with the Road Operation Act," says the speaker of the Transport Minister of Karel Hanzelk.
The accident in which a 20 - year - old steward died last week, apparently caused the driver of the cost vehicle to cross the bus.
The girl at that moment, unfortunately, sat near the driver, at least safe in the car, although she had two other places.
Nevertheless, the bus can heavy or slightly slightly, even in the moment when stevard differs from coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped with a technical demonstration of locations.
It is not approved in the bus, the traveler must sit.
The remote buses Student Agency has no location; which currently.cz confirmed also the director of Radim Jančur.
"This and the Ministers have decided and the movement of travellers was not allowed first.
Then we revoked it, and we grew up to the way that travelers could walk behind the bathroom to the bathroom if they had their seat," he announced his position.
The Law of the Steward doesn't know
"There is no unique legal explanation of the role of Stevard - no legislation will resolve this role.
However, no legislation does not prohibit the operators to provide services.
The road transport law only knows the termin of the spring vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," adds less uniquely Hanzelka speaker.
The Director of the Management Board of the Transport Ministry of the Road Carriers of Joseph Poor states that the problem of the law is sufficiently treated.
"It depends on whether the bus is authorised in the approval of the station.
That's what it's going to end," he says.
Business is divided in towns where there are locations for the station and the maximum range of locations, between cities with higher allowed station and remote places to be with the highest authorised location and seats of security trailers.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP Expert for Transport Safety Jaroslav Horien in the bus stevard movement does not see a major problem.
"It does not threaten a lot of dangers in the driving driving, it can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Nothing here is not sure when turbulence and aircraft can go into the head."
"Now, if the bus's swimming, of course, it applies physical laws.
Like in the town bus or tramway.
The safety of stevards must solve the internal rules," it says and also refers to, the problem is unresolved in the light of law.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
Student of the Agency offers stevard service as the only bus transporter.
He works on them two hundreds.
The Director does not even consider their call for risk.
"But I'll realize that the calling of stevards is risk, so I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can get travelers at the coming.
It would also be the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asian Alexi Litvin, who operates a breakdown of lines compared to SA, decreased the abstention of stevards in his cars.
"We have no stewards, we're standing against it from the beginning.
Before or after it ends the death rate," he said a little year ago for Week.cz.
There has been a tragedy that has become unmarried.
In the accident of a linking connection to Neapole, a young staff from Plzenica, who worked for two years for the company.
The Slovenian truck probably dropped out without using a guide from the resistance and locked the bus road.
His driver tried to avoid a manevre, but he was aware of the right front.
That two places were sold for the rest of stevards, Janchura refused.
"This place isn't possible to book at remote connections, they're blocked."
The company's going to complain the driver of the truck.
With the damage of the girl's family, the Agency waits for a court order, but the financial refund is also expected by the vineyard.
Justifying the law?
Invisible
The clarification of the movement of stevards on the bus car could bring adjustment of the law on which a thirty-first expert group of the Transport Ministerial works over the year.
"It wasn't done to any particular conclusion.
The buses do not solve too much, other than the point system, the maximum ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤
"The Ministry of Transports does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would primarily threaten the safety of travellers," concludes speaker Hanzelka with the power of the police and the work security offices.
On the Düsseldorfu is Frankfurt
The major words in the letter of the WestLB representation are missing to the employees of this bank.
The units of this Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the France Deka-Bank will appear "the central institution of the financial group compatible with trade in markets", see the letter that was received on Monday.
WestLB shall, according to the letter to this transaction, introduce the "kompetence" which ensures the period of revenue.
And, at all, such a link may be a decision-making impulse to further association in the country banks sector.
Such texts appear if a representation wants to demonstrate the ability to act during a problem period.
Instable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission but also by the Joint Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Northern Portuguese Government in the Westphail is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers have been able to know about its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever kind it is, yet, has been spoken for a longer time - even on the French side.
The Boss Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting half-year economic outcomes at the end of August, lets hear that it does not see sense in his banking house from Landstraße with some of the land banks, such as Helab or WestLB banks.
However, the Governing Council of Deka-Bank, for which one half of the Earth Bank and one of the other unions are associated, has conferred the representation by the leading of discussions with WestLB on common business activities.
This may be about trades on the market or part of them.
However, the conversations have just started, and the financials are undertaken.
The Deka-Bank, which belongs to the most important employees in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak first in relation to consolidation in the competitive sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank could reach.
There was nothing from this triple at last.
Shortly after the fence plans were reached to the public, the Hesenian earthly government was expressed against the Helaba Bank.
Even the rest of the bank's houses haven't been connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, instead of obtaining Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgartu.
However, speculations on the Deka-Bank connection to the earth banks were repeatedly discovered.
However, in recent times, Günther Merl, president of the Bank of Helaba, was a negative point to the speculators on the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that, independently of this, the conviction that the combination of different banking houses in the public law sector is necessary.
Now after the choices of the earthly snow in Bavorska, the BayernLB connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be started first.
It's not just a good news for Hellabu.
In order to increase the pressure for further fuses, the possible partners for such connections are progressively advanced.
On the south, it would only play a second hostel, even though the financial crisis is far better than the bank's houses in Mnich and Stuttgart.
The connection with WestLB again at the beginning of the year prohibited Swaz a competitive and bird bank Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 50% share in Helabia.
In view of this, it would appear to be the most highest North LB.
However, the geostrategic views of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how many commercial models of individual institutions are shiping together.
In June, Merl stated that the decision-making question of the future competitiveness of the earth banks should be ensured by the commercial model, the German Union was compatible and the Geneva banks did not later respond.
Everything could also end with the WestLB solution that, of course, no one will take in this institution.
That is why the letter of the Dark Representative also refers to the attempt to "complex solution" for the whole bank.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual folders to Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second week of October Festival is known as "weekend with Italy"
For Elena it's the first, for Luke's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so it'll be different, he says.
After them, at the five-literary court of the Caiser marks, there is a stronger tutor and two hundred tourists at October Festival shows how deep tons can extract his horse.
Elena Luca's going to dance first and then love him.
They came to Verona from Bolone.
From here, from the bus parking near Poorta Nuova, four buses will come out this evening at 23.45, with the label "destination Monaco, festa della birra", as suggested income 6.30.
Three buses are mainly covered by the Italians, and in one bus they are driven exclusively in Brazil.
In one corner of the park, these South Americaans sang with their flag, they celebrated the night.
And that's a voice, says MarcoGuard, that's nothing for Italy.
March, who has a long cab with a bowl of the skin's imitation and brilliant with a wide silver wheels, belongs to the three buses.
Five years ago, he has been driving to October, only in the year he has arranged three corrections.
On the night, the day between the beer stones, at 22.30, go back.
The overnight would only mean unfair costs, says Marco.
The road is 75 euros to be welcomed by the beer Kaiser, accurately covered in accordance with the Baby law on purity of beer, health insurance and German speaker - Marco walked in Frankfurt for a language course.
The buses go out to night, on the road to Brennero.
The beer doesn't give it, not yet.
The bus is quiet, the traveling is sleeping.
They're doing good, they'll still need their powers.
It is located in Brixena and Holzkirchen, where there is 8 pieces before Mnich, and with other buses with the Italian recognition mark.
When the Mark's group finally comes to the park near Theresienwiss, there are about 50 other buses in Europe.
Elena, Luca and the rest are gathered, Marco has the last statement, explains the attack plan.
First, put a yellow bottle.
It is written at the left of the swabache, "Oktoberfest", near Marcova's Internet address to the office: "coscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door is opened into the beer apartment, run!" Marco calls in the early air.
"Stop!" Let's run and put places in the back of the apartment.
"I'm not forward to prevent you, and not all the yellow bottles on the same lay, go through the space!"
Masz is eight euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the cocktails.
"Let the Security show that we're acting rightly.
When you leave your places, they are gone."
Third, "Today evening exactly at the half of the eleventh, be here again!"
And up to Wiesn, a space with a drinking room.
The road one member of the group refers to the yellow bottles as marks on trees, cedules and even on the electoral plaque of one large bathroom side.
You need to get ready for access.
As a weekend with Italy, I know the second weekend of October Festival.
Exact information on the number of visits is not available; about fifty thousand people who are released through Alpa and entered into beer camps, ten percent of all visits this weekly arrived from Italy.
A series of Monichov police sent seven police from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support Bavorian red cross, leading to the nationality in which the Italians before the British (ca 60 bars) and Rakušana (ca 80) with approximately 200 medical medical treatments are the first place.
It's especially favorite in the Italians Hofbrea City.
Free night for the believer Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Social Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück highlighted that the German Bank system is relatively stabil.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatedly" and has also been involved in its claim that the German Bank will not remain secure for crisis development.
Because the next weekend has come.
The Dax recorded financial house specialised for the financing of the unnecessary Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive from the consortium of German banks a loan for a number of billion to protect from market turbulences.
The person notified on Monday said to the Agency Reʹs that the credit aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
Lessons will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the exhausted amount.
The money is expected to be entered from private and public banks.
The losses of Depfa's daughter's company are in the background.
According to the news report on the projects on which the money was loaned, this State financial was extremely shortly refined, which is now impossible because of unbelieving in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reservation was decreased by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own share was easily decreased from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current expenditure and pure expenditure from financial trades over the past year were decreased to zero, the expenditure from increased value of the interests and of certain value papers and also the distortion of the reserves for credit trades were decreased by over 70 per cent per EUR 5 million.
Only by the higher refunds for the following calculation costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the replacement of rates in accordance with the tax order and for the increase in the trade in individual companies, the sixty-percent reduction in the amount of revenue was still measured.
The former State financial was burned in 1990 after its privatization on the hypoteques for animals, which were then collected from the service portfolio, and followed by Aareal Bank.
Since the classic state financing was too small, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private investors and State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
From the value of your daughter's company, now Hypo Real Estate has to describe something and these replies will have "the basic mass effect" to calculate profits and losses of the whole group, as some have been uncertainly heard.
I think it's dividend.
Two thirds were decreased for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate is a significant financial of State and infrastructure projects since Depfa is taken.
More powerful than other institutions depend on refining on the interbank market because there are no customers' contributions.
After the fall of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the interbancational credit industry was decreased because the banks kept their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually for the part of the Depfa credit portfolio - approximately 50 billion euros - shortly for refining.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice, the financial need for this group is covered for a supervisory period and the company is protected "with the influence of the international money markets currently to a significant level of incapacity".
Other resources were allowed to hear that these money were guaranteed to refine until the end of 2009.
Instead, the President of the HRE Georg Funke announced that the Hypo Real Estate Group had to use money markets at the appropriate time.
The Social Bank and the Société for Financial Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is now insured.
That's what the shareholders and the trusting banks hope.
However, as regards dynamic and inappropriacy of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It doesn't even have been completely dismissed that the credit wouldn't be completely deployed.
However, it could not be removed.
After the bank stood in front of the bank on Sunday afternoon, according to all, he can't be preliminary, the salvation can't be quietly.
The action currency falls by 75 per cent per EUR 3.30.
Instead, the obligations were well held.
While the primary debts have not been moved, the secondary obligations are lost more clearly.
This is mainly the obligations of the former daughter's company Württemberg Hypo and the logic obligations with the time of freedom after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate obligations have seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is necessary after a significant determination of the bank's crisis and the crisis of the institution's self-institution, which has introduced it into the company by the Depfa, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as banks, governments and less affected trade banks will be willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the payment of value papers in their payment period.
However, it may also be possible to reach what almost no one is currently awaiting hope - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, as regards reports that are present at the same time with this partial statement, the probability of a certain person is now only allowed to be right now.
This, especially for the believers, will probably prepare a number of distressed nights when they will decide whether to deal with their obligations.
The short-term investors may use the limit line for at least create losses from the previous annual periods to the currency costs for the future payment of taxes from the revenue.
Sylvana and the secret of the box of bento
When the sixty-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop first day is presented at the high school in Tachibana, girls are starting to entertain: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word already from Mang.
"For the day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I had an invitation from the way to school.
I live in Tokia in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes to the middle of Tachibana.
I had to find my way alone, for lucky I didn't lose myself.
It seems that the beginning of learning on Tachibana is not given as heavy as we've been in the Down Saska.
Students are going to go in after eighth hour and twenty minutes ago the ninth starts a short meeting with the artist, i.e. 'home room'.
But even before the learning started, I had to imagine.
In fact, I am not the type of man who speaks in front of people, so before 40 students class.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've taken an old hostel of my guest mothers to the black, blue undergrounds and black skin bottles.
So I was set before the lavice and tried to say everything right, "Sajoara Wo still Sylvana..." -- I'm called Sylvana, I'm coming from Germany and I'm born in a week.
At that moment, I was too fair that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 holes in the class were crazy, chichotalo and mavalo, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that of my man.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed to survive and means 'soft, sweet'.
Then I've gone to my place.
The girl near me laughed enough, thought it was the honour that she had to sit near her.
The rest of the hour was relatively calm, but when the gong answered, I was just drunk.
They talked over each other, and they chichotted and asked me about possible and impossible -- and then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, when they stopped, they all packed their bags.
My host mom also made me a box for dinner -- and that's something else than the needy German baths.
I had a rise with vegetables, small parkings, a salat from a cow and a race, fruit and a cookie fish in the tofu.
Most of all, I don't know exactly what I eat here in Japan.
These things look special, and they're looking very new.
Of course, everything's really good.
Well, maybe on the salt-loaded swimming, bro!
Benta at Japan's schools are not just a dinner.
Sometimes the girl gives the boy a handly prepared beet, which is particularly modified by the artist, and hopes that the boy knows closely about the breakfast.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm aware if I'll see it here too.
"Why is Japan just?" My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo a year.
Then I said,
'Cause he's just fascinating me.'
Finally, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning Japanese once.
So I was absolutely sure that I had to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, habits and habits.
And they're high prices here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest trends and trends, on the other hand it is cruel, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything's so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokio's the biggest city I've ever seen."
And the cross have feelings
When cross or wedding flee from the danger, does it mean that they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same when they be like us?
The internet magazine "E" has been published for several years from known students.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series represents the selected answers to the question "What do you think of true, unless you can prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other statuss, without me or anyone else to prove it, if we can also prove that the houses have the last people.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have a suitable fundamental configuration.
However, when we continue to renew another kind and open the issues of assumption or generally domains, we enter into an inadequate teren because hardware does not agree.
When the cross gets in danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: he will assume that he is dead, angry or attacked.
People are choosing similarly, from which some of them are referring to comparable livelihood entities.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective life to animals.
It is, however, because the areas associated with humandom almost include the side prefrontal cortex (which is due to its share in short memory and execution or management).
This broadcast is developed in humans very much more than in the final primates, and it seems that the other creatures are completely missing.
At least in the aspects of our domain, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including who we are and who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a view that man is even different from the final priorities.
Another dramatic speciality could hide the language foundation of a person: because a large part of his view is connected to the language, it is often said that the domain depends on it.
In this case, the animals could be cut off.
But even if the language doesn't matter, the tongue would certainly affect it, so the animal domain would have been constructed anyway, probably different from the state of our domain.
That is why it is difficult to find out how it seems to look for the final animals.
When, like something internal and subjective, it doesn't even give us any adjustment, because of a special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experiences, it puts us into consideration before great problems.
The majority of my results are related to the volume of life, but there is also another aspect of the domain that should be accessible to a decade.
It might be possible to examine the processes of animals without prejudice to their content, and it is precisely a short memory in studies in primates, especially in visualization.
But this approach to Christof Koch and Francis Crick focused more on the neural corelates than on the cash mechanisms: both can be identical, but they may not be.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of non-frontal corex for the implementation of visualization.
What's going on for feelings?
I'm exporting them from that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is active in the brain.
What we mean as "fear" is, then, the mental status in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its results, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
Seeing from this angle, the feelings of anxiety are related to those cortexs, especially people.
In connection with language naturality, there is a fair decline of views, because using words and games we can distinguish and category status, and they are added to others with themselves.
In contrast, Antonio seems that feelings result from the most primitive activity of the cortex and the brain-related physical feelings, such as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more focused on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could be quietly shared in the feelings of most animal plants.
I can't resist the theoretics, but I think it's not proofable.
Pankseep arguments that what we have in the cross and people look like fear, they probably feel the same: How is it possible to verify, but the Pankseep continues to say, do the cross and people feel the same when they are likely choosing?
A wedding from dangers of anger - does he feel fear too?
In my view, it can't only be the likeness of behavior to prove the compatibility of life.
It is true that neural comparison moves us to: cross and people have similar brain tribes, contrary to the fabric or the brain.
But is it a responsible brain tribe for the feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to man: how would they prove it at the cross?
I think the cross and other boys, maybe even swimming (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably different from ours (for the humandom is based on special circuits and languages), I examine the emotional behaviour of emotional behaviour than the emotional consideration of the cross.
Everyone in this case can wait for a progress at the neural level if we have the same measure in the cross and in people.
As at the cross, I don't examine the language and the domain, I don't know or not, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to think it's short, but I'm going to proceed before I'm repeatedly opposed to the wall.
I'm a practical emotional.
President EUFA Platini: Friday of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparation will soon drive directly President and Prime Minister.
"The government views EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Me together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, but it's not amnestie.
The work has just started, and in both countries it's still much to do."
In timeful fulfillment of the time plan of building or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and aeroplane both hosts serves.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for Me are reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
Now we have to work as far as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA will continue to follow us."
Another radical step was voted in Poland.
The leading of the Poland Union PZPN was revoked by the National Olympical Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlockim.
The committee was meeting at the request of the Minister for Sports of Miroslav Treveck.
"Severe dangers that the PZPN is not able to act in accordance with the rules," said the Dublin Poland Printing Agency PAP.
"President EUFA Michael Platini's letter confirmed that this step does not suffer preparation for ME 2012."
Some teams of the first ligue were only in the past for manipulation to the needed level, and finally, it had to be even moved to the beginning of the ligue.
Revolved Dennis Quaid returns the worm
She wanted to make advertising a new movie, talking about private matters - and now she has problems with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke about her former Dennis Quaidova as a relaxer of marriage.
The shot and returns the cow.
The persecuted war runs in the former female couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: seven years after divorce together, these two hollywood herds lead a big dispute - before public air.
Meg Ryan in a conversation for the American magazine InStyle last week eated to the damn of her wife: "Dennis was my time incredible, and it was very painful."
It appears that she learned about the range of the football until she was divorced.
Subject to this soul striptic was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of the disgusting marriage.
Dennis Quaida's reaction to his presentation as an unbelieving husband was clear: "He's crazy," said the 14-year-old herc of New York Daily News, "Mag repeatedly survives the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Moreover, it is "political", that the joint sixty-year-old son of Jack "is publicly in pain and radical changes that are for each child's divorce."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid is again married and has recently become a father of doubles.
His views of prevention are as follows: "My life goes everywhere further.
I think I'm happy to have a spectacular family that's great."
Aeroplane prices and hotels decrease
In the first half of 2008, the years and housing in Europe were lower than the previous year.
In Germany, years according to one current study were even less than 50 percent.
Years and apartment in hotels again bad - this is the result of study of American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations carried out from the first half of 2008 and after the prices in the first quarter, the result of their significant decrease in the second quartal.
After a few years the prices on the hotel market increased, living in many places has already been bad.
From January to March, prices have grown in 41 of the 48 followed European cities still in average of 6,9 % compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were less than 3,6 per cent than the previous year.
This trend was most clear in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less than the previous year.
Because of this trend, the American Express considers a weak dollar course that caused the "comfort of American tourists to travel".
The decrease of hotel prices was also stronger achieved by the financial center than the industrial center, such as Hannover, Coline over Rin or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the prices of the hotels with their increase of 26.3 per cent even changed the European record.
In the first quarter, the airport prices also showed a higher trend:
As a result of the delivery of kerosin, travellers in the Economy class had to pay more than 7.1 per cent than in 2007, for fuel fuel in the remote degree of 29.2 per cent.
Since April to June, the airport prices in the Economy class were decreased with a average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, however, in the Business and First-Class classes changed knowledge was less distinct.
The prices in Germany were even more distinct than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11,9 percent increased, in the second quarter, by 23,6 per cent.
In German national years, according to the quoted study, the prices even decreased by half.
One of the payments for this price fall is a slow economic growth, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure for the Open Skies agreement that liberalized the airport between the United States and Europe.
The signing of the penetration is the distortion of unfair airlines to air transporters and also a high number of aircraft companies, which in the first half of 2008 announced the concurrence - it was only 24 aircraft companies in Europe.

Dark mass affects the years of universe sonds
Years have no knowledge of advice with one mysterious phenomenon: Dark mass affects the level of space sonds during the manevre swing-by (gravation practice).
Experts are afraid that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeness wouldn't have to stay completely right.
Almost 18 years of a world sond "Ulysses" was flying into the universe.
It is the fault of the burning leaders that will soon be frozen, that the death of the winter is now threatened.
A mysterious phenomenon has acted in the mistake - anomalia of gravitation.
Gravity Practic is a aircraft manager of universal sonds, with additional liquidity in the gravitation polygon of a global body, such as the Earth.
This means that the sonds can save a lot of fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, European-American research investigation, used this physical trick as the Ulysses sun-sound.
However, it has been stated for years in this case in a wonderful case: the flying body is delayed gradually as it would be expected by an old gravity law.
On the contrary, it comes to irregularity in the world.
The sonds are unexpectedly slow or slow.
Until the physicians could not explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomalie of gravity.
A few experts are afraid that even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeness, which describes the attractiveness of the weight of the covering space, should not be completely correct.
The American physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not missing, and is trying to explain an anomalia of gravitation practice through such called dark mass, which his presence in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomalia may be a dark mass that might also be able to be a very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark mass is about the worldwide researchers just about ten years.
It obviously comes from the gravity force, which is my attention to the other universe body.
Instead, she is completely invisible, which means that she doesn't send or reflect any electromagnetic records, just or visible light.
According to the calculators, this dark weight is a good five of the total weight of the universe.

Injury with my father, leading to suicide.
A few years of misuse of my father led a woman to kill herself, to be in front of the court.
After accepting eight cases of sexual disorder, seventy-six-year-old Michael Treris from Stithians in Cornwal was sentenced for six years.
The Coronary Court in Truro heard that his non-evil daughter Stephanie Randle regularly joined her when she was between five and seven years.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote to Treris in knowledge.
In the court, it was also said that Mr Randle killed in her home in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007 in 34 years.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise joined her and bound her eyes and then sexually exploited her while her mother worked in the household.
Treris and his wife were divorced in the 80s and returned to Cornwal.
His improper daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, Mrs. Randle, who spent a major part of his time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, followed the evidence of a disuse that had been duplicated twice a week.
Mrs. Randle's friends in 2006, who also were very surfing and cyclistics, said that she was "emotionally dead" and "released life".
In April 2007, her father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.

"This uncomfortable story ends by taking life in the victim.
More terrified is that if she didn't do so, the thing would not be done to the court at all."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the results that I had your crime on their daughters according to the Stephanian parents for those years," he added.
"Only it would be a promised, successful and happy young woman."
The Officer who lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that the government official, who left a very secret documents in the street in June, will be accused of the State Secrets Law.
The man concerned left two extremely secret documents in the Waterloo trail in the time when he was temporarily assigned to the Defence Ministership.
The documents were in the hand of BBC before the police were transferred.
It is at least a serious crime against that law, and it does not indicate a criminal purpose.
The BBC writer for defence issues, Frank Gardner, said that this is a surprise for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was inside between the Ministry and the Government Authority," he said.
The employee not to be appointed shall be charged in accordance with section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is a clause to protect information.
The Coronary Prosecutor recommended the Metropolit police officer to complain on a very sensitive basis for his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot included secret analyses of Al-Kaida and the possibilities of Iraq security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday and moved from home to an unknown place.
Other funds of B&B debt debt
British companions’ funds may have to have to arrange for more than 80 million pounds after the Bradford & Bingley Bank's salvation.
The government offered 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion dollars.

Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the contributions she holded and that the funds of that would pay approximately 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance considers that the amount of growth in 2009 was of 450 million euros.
This means that the funds will have to find 81 million pounds to cross rates from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of Communication Association, said BBC is convinced that it is not just.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that have been conducted carefully during the expansion of the living market now have to pay some of the institutions that have not been so considerable."
According to the BSA, no funds have come from 1945 when they appeared.
"We'll have to examine all aspects of this thing during the next few weeks, and they have seen the possibilities of protecting partners and their members from the one that could be essential," added Cole.
The 2009 tax shall cover seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, the payment of the total year will be due to the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount.

Rejected purchases for the Bangladesh Extremeer
The Bangladesh court refused the request of the former Prime Minister Shaich Hasina Wadjid for the release of the cow, which means that if he returns to the authority, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to leave her in the case of an accusation that she had received from the actual employee over fifty million (729 700 dollars) when she was a premisesman.
The case is one of some accusations from the corruption that are against it.
Chalida Siea, a recent political rival of Shaych Hasina, has been released in the past this month.
Shech Hasina has to return to Bangladesh during the next few weeks, but her side, Lid Liga (Awami League), requested that the government holds her local armies first to give full freedom.
The writers say that while it was released on a honest word to be able to take the medical progress, it is not according to the submission of its release if she remains on freedom until she returns to Bangladesh.
Its lawyers say that the Supreme Court's Regulation is now revoked to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Shaich Hassina for the cooking with no cooking, when she is already undergoing an investigation released to honest declaration," said her deputy Rafique-ul Huq.
"Over the Court's Regulation we are going to be revoked."
Its lawyers claimed that it would have been covered in order to begin to return to the country for preparation for the elections.
The High Representative of Lithuania said Shaych Hassin should return home after October 17th.
It was arrested last year after the interim government held by the Army, but it was released in June to be able to enter the medical progress.
Shah Hasin and Chalida Siea both reject all the accusations against themselves.

BSkyB has lost the courtship on ITV
The BSkyB has lost the Court of Justice to review the Commission's decision on economic competition, which has ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive ITV transmission company.
The Court of Justice for Economic Competition recommended that BSkyB decrease its share in the ITV by 17,9 % under 7,5 %.
The Commission declared earlier that the share of BSkyB had distorted competitive fighting and had an indirect impact on ITV.
BSkyB purchased a share in 2006 in the trade that was in consequences prohibited by NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Justice announced that the BSkyB's participation in the ITV was caused to doubt the independence of the ITV, and invited the Commission for the economic competition to initiate the investigation.
The Consortian Boss Virgin Sir Richard Branson, the needed organization and official regulator of Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the needed reduction of its share in the ITV was incomprehensible and as a disproportional solution - especially because BSkyB said earlier that it was willing to grant its voting rights.
New investigation of American lawyers' affairs
The United States Major Representative appointed a special complainant to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
It came to the time when the report on the matter, which was developed by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized the officers of the White House, the lawmaker and the former Minister for Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was encouraged by fearing that the lawyers were removed from political opinions.
Nora Dannehy's special complaint will now examine whether the officers of hearing during the investigation lie to the investigators with the purpose of encouraging justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine said in the report: "The serious order for potential criminal proceedings was not completely investigated or explained."
The name of a special complainant with the ability to offer witnesses was one of its key recommendations.
Spor started when the American Justice Ministry delivered nine American lawyers in 2006 from their own.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers were released because of weak effects.
However, it was shown that lawyers' releases were not assessed for anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the release was motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were engaged in the execution of the highly established Republican staff and Senators, others refused to investigate the complaints against the Democracy against the voters.
American lawyers are investigating and carrying complaints in cases of court for government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed from political matters.
At the same time, Minister Alberto Gonzales, the head of the Ministry of Justice, was obtained under fire and finally rejected.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice was also rejected.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical to the role of Gonzalese in the affair, saying that he had "loud responsibility" for the release, "abdicating" from his leading position and "not carefully involved".
Other officials, namely the former Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized because they did not work in investigation.
Meat Loaf's command will be assessed
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will receive one of the prices Q Awards for his epic hymne Bat Out of Hell.
The song who for his special gold price will come to the ceremonial next week in London said he was "respected" by the recognition obtained.
The song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title track of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
Nomination for the annual year is held by the Coldplay group, which has been in four categories of outer selection.
Paul Rees, the main editor of Magazine Q, said, "There are some songs standing over such things, such as time and genre, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed a big voice that offered Meat Loaf.
She started an instrumental part that was about two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a song, and the most higher came to the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell was holding around nine years and sold it throughout the world over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - named Marvin Lee Aday - suffered health problems in the past years, was also operated in 2003 because of an irregular heart rythm after he was collapsed on the ground.
In 2007, the acute laryngitide made him reject the concerts.
After it was shown that he was on the voting cystas.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, districts and other earthly communications, some famous, other only useful.
But even many veteran taxickers and local years have difficulties when they have to find Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This small street is in the quarter of East Village and leads north of the Private Street - without getting on the Second Street - between Bowery and Druhou avenue.
At the width of approximately ten and 40 meters longer at the lock of a locked road than to transport.
There's no sedule on the street name.
The current atlas is practically invisible.
However, the street has a wonderful.
For example, Avalon Bay, developer of recently built luxury buildings on the street.
He wants Extra Place to replace and create a cleaner way to business and bottles that are opened in the new buildings.
Other admirators are the years of neighbors who say they've been decreased by the street just because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was listened.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of a campaign, which has the street in its power, does not have the least interest to keep it.
At the meeting of the Agricultural Committee of the Community, the representatives of the Civil Authority and Avalon Bay planned to buy a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer's circuit manager of the Community 3, the Committee predicts a variety where the street remains in the hand of the city and requests a new plan to be given next month.
"The city's own is only a few lands, and I think it's to stay extra Place in his property," she said.
"They could have been given our rights and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to replace the small street and put places for the session, from which some of them would use a café whose interests were the developer's interest.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michael de Milly, speaker Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, he doesn't want to own it.
"The Avalon Bay's intention to make this deserted road and make her a beautiful place for the public," she added, "sell to the city.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Office of Conservation, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, and he understood that the task of his office was the property to develop more than to manage.
In comparison with his higher neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a little trace in the history.
Some people think that the streets got their name in 1802, when the big pharmacovigilance Philip Minthorna was divided between some of his children and no one made a decree on that heavy country.
To Extra Place, the back door of the CBGB, the punkrock memory that closed in 2006, and the street may be the most famous as the background of the photograph of the Ramones group "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was anonymous," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who made it in November 1976.
"There were full of waste, broken clothes and bars, placates, sheets and samples."
Some local, especially bloggers who write about hearing the fourth East Village, stand against the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that that the cuss of public property, being cool, should remain public.
Others consider extra Place as a funeral - too unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes the blog named Jeremiah's mixing New York (with the subtitle "The New York Book: the warm nostalgic view of the city in the mid-process"), reported a part of the story about the Extra Place from the rubrik Talk about the city that appeared in the New Yorker newspapers in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a nice blind street, dark even on the day, and deeply stumbled by the rail doors of the funds and the locked windows, where the old news are spent in the streets a week."
Until a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening seemed totally the same.
The cross passed through the blind end of the street near the door that had ever led to CBGB, where the trade with a dear dress is today.
On the wall there was graphics, and near the fresh dose of throated newspapers was a blank beer.
Some of the surroundings said that Extra Place thinks a little bit, but it felt that he'd be able to walk.
In contrast, Fields said that they think that some people underestimate the activity of the trailer in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in dark, low and rebellious places."
Debat on bilinguality: Injury to English
In this rubrik, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Isumi will discuss the position of candidates to bilingue education.
Lance T. Izumi, the academic employee of the California and the team manager of education in the Organization of Research Institute for Public Police, is together with the book "Worry than you think: why you have a high school class."
Effectively celebrating the Spanish electors is an extraordinary matter.
Barack Obama's training agenda only proves it.
The ambam's campaign subscribes that "afro-American and Spanish students have substantially less probability that they study than white walls," which is true.
In order to fight such performance differences, Obam's educational agenda is particularly encouraged, in addition to the "previous two-lingual education" for those who are learning English.
The question on Barack Obam remains, however, if his commitment to bilingue education, which claims to be used in the class other languages than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance divisions.
Let's take an example of Sixth Street Prep, Charter Base School in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are totally in the cases of His’client families.
More than three students, from whom many recently arrived, learned English.
However, in the state tests of mathematical tests in 2008, the highest level of incredible hundred percent of quarter classes.
However, ninety-three percent of the fourth classes were achieved at the highest level in state tests from English and English.
This incredible success has been achieved by other methods than Obama preferred.
Sixth Street highlights control and exercise, continuous review of ability and access without excuse.
Next, and Obama should notice, according to Lindy Mikels, director Sixth Street, the pedagogic access to school for those who learned English first, "full deceit".
Poverty to English highlights at the same time the primary use of English in learning.
After Michaels, who is against the bilingue education, said to me, "We had a huge success with one completely new boy from Mexico -- you would enter into the class after twelve months and not leave who it is."
"It works," she said, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep for a pattern, how should other schools look with large parts of Spanish and English students?
The results of the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a double-lingual staff) and its own consistent support for double-jack education deny the response of the Bombam.
While Obama agrees that the promotors should learn English, he recently trivialized the thing when he declared that people should stop taking care of "only Ethiopian" laws.
Instead, "You should ensure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
As Obama wants to delete the performance differences, it should be more about the educational patterns that work, think carefully than to smile and trivialise them.
Ropa's decline due to renewable economic concerns
The roof prices on Monday have fallen because of the fear that not even the American financial market salvation plan would have to survive the economies.
The prices of the terminated trading with the rope decreased in the early trade in the New York Commodity Burge to 7 per cent by 99.80 per bar.
Since last Monday, the prices have fallen over twenty dollars per bar.
In the past two weeks, the markets with comodits were disturbed by financial concerns on Wall Street and two strong uricans in Mexico.
After reaching the maximum of $145,29 per bar in July, the price falled up to $90 per barley before this month, so that the deficiency of the financial markets was re-covered.
Usz re-invested on Monday, even after the President-in-Office told the Congress that the weekend has reached an agreement on the greatest salvation plan in the history.
This report was shaded with fresh fear that the financial crisis has finally been far away.
In the latest episode of the division, the government announced that the Citigroup group purchases the banks to Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have partially established the European Fortis financial conglomerate.
Analysers of Barclays Capital said that a lost weekly negotiation that led to a plan for economic salvation, "seemed unable to survive the market."
As economic advances, it is expected that the demand for comodits, including ropes, falls.
"The overviews of markets with global shares, tax rates and currency currency were strongly distorted," wrote the Deutsche Bank analyses in the report to investors.
"We believe that commodities can avoid abilities.
From the commodity perspective, our greatest age, to what extent the American virus will spread throughout the world, especially China."
The analysers of this bank have limited their expectations to the next year, since the growth need was decreased due to the latter growth of the economy and decreased their preliminary benzine prices for 2009 by approximately 20 %.
The whistle in the second quarter overcome the record of the team
After he worked in Jets dress in the last eight season more than anyone else, the defense player Shaun Ellis thought he had already seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he followed the development of the second quarter, where Jets changed the freedom game in a spaned jazz.
"I never saw anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizons Cardinals were equipped with their wounded game with the dark darkness over themselves.
Afterwards, the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Colese to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly refers to the afternoon, in which their development cooperation gradually moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter after the next two touchdowns, especially in which he fell cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half the storage.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his cover to Coles.
"It's a good player.
It was good to communicate to us, that people might think anything."
During Favre and Coles, the defence attacked the Cardinals Kurta Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis captured a crazy walk and returned it to 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric'ith printed another record and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens gave Warner to smoke.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens urged, was probably the best.
The Cardinals team reached the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got a ball from the cup, Jay Feely 20-yards from the field, which was obtained by the lead 34-0.
That's most of what Jets got in one square.
Couch Jets Eric Mangini when he was invited to describe this crazy, he said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A lot of points have fallen in a short time range."
The rest of Bresselassia has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassia, from Ethiopia, again showed why many think it as the best distance run at all when he overcome his own world record on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon and became the first person who passed 26,2 miles long train under two hours and four minutes.
With victory at a pleasant area of trate at 2:03:59 he converted for 27 seconds in his previous time 2:04:26, which passed the past year in Berlin.
Breeselassia, who is 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is incrediblely wide - overcome the world record or at least the world's master at all distances from the metrical miles per marathon.
Last month, Bresselassia left the olympical marathon in Peking because he was afraid - from the back view may be too scared - that the polluted air disturbs his problems with astmate.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In the meantime of perfect subminations - sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the goal - he wined Brasselassia on Sunday with a district of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per miles.
What the traveling runners likeGBress and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a longer trail, the marathon record declined in the past decade for more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil wined in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday victory, he told the journalists that he had two weeks a floor in the spring and left a week a train.
It's obvious that the pause was more awake than it's stayed.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little surprise today, but everything was okay."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the Eastern African Rival of Ethiopia - because he had planned overwhelmed his entertainment, generally avoided the world's marathonic spices, looked at the leaders, as if it was a road cargo, and made world records over the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly decrease the great running quality of Bresselassie.
Holded at the time of the four Kenyans reached Bresselassia half at 1:02:04.
After the leaders had fallen, two elite kinesian runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to travel Gebreselassie.
About something before three miles before the goal of Bresselassia, he finally took and fled Kwambai, who then passed on the other place at 2:05:36, and thus improved his personal maximum for five minutes.
Camathi ended the third at 2:07:48.
In the bathroom, women ended the seventh year in the most famous time of history 2:19:19 Irina Michitennk, a birthday from Kazakhstan, now a citizen of Germany.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Sixty-year-old Mikitennk surprisedly won the halls at London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Peking games left for something that was described as a hurt behind, but she refused and wined in Berlin and in the third marathon, which was running, improved her personal maximum of five minutes.
The train was running smartly and thoughtfully: she let the fourth Ethiopian and Kenya run into a big shot and then reached it about 18 1⁄2 miles ago.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia reached the second at 2:21:31 and Helene Cyprus from Kenya ended the third at 2:25:01.
Heart and obstacles of the lives of black in a separate city
Hidden between the distractions of the park of Orland, a few miles from all the glacial, furious and furious, is a quiet city in which the pride and the prodigality of African life.
Eatonville, the first entirely black town, which was joined into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer so easy as she described in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three lakes of croquets, three hundred of honey skin, three hundred of good floors, enough of kidney, two schools and no events."
Now it's a trailing place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Etonville Festival of Zora! to put up the gift of Hurston, the most famous women writer of Harlem Renession.
The city she described remains on the side, even though she made a delay for tourists by included it in a florid tourist branch created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It's still so independent, mental and private, as was in the thirty years when Hurston wrote that the foreign blackmans in Florida often dealed and did not share their feelings with a white man who "which knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's going on."
Even today, in the year when the Black President's candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, there remains a lot of people now watching the views of strangers.
"We give great attention to how our story is spoken," says 59-year Hortens Jones, who lives here since birth and is a member of the oldest pharmacy in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville was characterized as paradox triumph and ourahy.
It's like the historical model of black rise, so the community of 2400 people, where the poverty measure is double-fold over the international prospectus.
It is a centrality, but also a shadow of the shadow example of the Southern Foreign Church - sometimes conceived, sometimes praised - which came from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the people now are so proud and protective.
And anxieties about the imagination of Eatonville have actually started with Zora, which is the only way that Hurston's name is here.
She presented the world her family city through the heart books full of words such as "Mules and Men (Muly and men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (These eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the florid tourist bridge changed the town of the gate to the street No. 17, which leads through the often mixed centre of Florida, in the podium of black history and human drama.
With the divisions of a big bubble in life and literature, Hurston readers brought into the trade of the first Etonville older Joe Clark, and then returned to private places.
"Left at the road," she wrote, "is a white white hole of modern national school with well-contained courts and games of which Howard Miller is old, even if he doesn't have power to read or write."
She also mentioned the new Witness wife of Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and everything that matches the hour hotel."
So in only a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville joined himself, but also with non-grams, rebuilding records and sex.
This was evidently not a typical Fodor's packing.
It wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says Ninety-year Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who Hurston acted immortally by feeling men who sing about their beautiful songs.
"Some people didn't like it," added she.
It still takes it to Hurstone as a chipper center, which often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventy-seventy-year-old Augustus Franklin realizes that when she arrived in the city, she reached without reporting in a low Chevrolet, smoke and weared bullets in the city, which is also fierce in the day.
Most of the people were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were hurt.
"The people of Zora have seen," said Franklin.
But, added, he shoots on the stairs on the back terrace with a view to the Sea of Sabelia, where Hurston was with the greatest probability of baptized, "never remained too much."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor, and her books were printed.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her together with the rest of the world.
Although a literary star, the present Langstone Hughes and the only black at Barnard College in the 20th century, it was buried in an unsignified grave in the Florida Fort Pierce, where she lived before.
In Eatonville there were no more contracting offices or large public reading.
"I think they didn't understand her importance for the world or her reference," said Valerie Boyd, the author of Hurston's book "Wraped and Rainbows (Zabaleno in spirits)" published in 2003.
The change came in the 80s of the 20s.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to stretch the city of five-produced distances instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-progressed main road.
Orland's dilution has already passed by the intergovernmental district No. 4 through the west border of the city.
It came to us at the time when Eatonville was still obtained from a complex history period.
Private integration, together with other things, ended the relatively idolic isolation of this community.
In the fifty-years of the 20th century, he brought a fight on mixing race to a community.
"In that time, a park of white kids, they came and threw the potters and things on people who sat on the side," said Franklin.
"We actually had one lady that killed.
They went out of the car meloon."
In the 1955 newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston’s Supreme Court's request for the needed integration and his decision in the case of Brown against the educational room, stated that it was "for my race more insultant than celebrating."
The people now claim that the department of schools, even though it was in a positive position, decreased the coherence in Eatonville and underground the courage of the younger.
"The Black Children were usually on objects - I remember - you took your teacher, you took your teacher tonight," said N. Y. Nath, the daughter of Elly Dinkins and the executive director of the non-request group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
It's been the time until the teachers and the kids buried from the same place, she added.
"You don't care about your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," she said:
Civil rights, however, helped to create a space for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, herds and artists, who like her have raised themselves over the prejudices with a lightly conscious self-conscious and quotations such as, "How can someone cope with the pleasure of my presence!
I won't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker visited the unsignified Hurston's grave and began to fight for the survival of her story.
In five years later, he came to the police in bookgroups of Hurston's exhibit from Robert E. Hemenway, who re-organized her to the American Canon.
The remote project arrived just on the moment when the most glorious daughter of Eatonville found a ramp light again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a saver.
In order to demonstrate what might happen to destroy its defence, the community began planning Hurston's festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans reached the in-surance action two years later, and each ice returns to celebration.
Staying for a few years from the remote ship.
"The five springs of the valley risen, you would say that it was just from, by civil fierceness," said Nath.
Boyd said it easier, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the remote project helped to change the image of the city.
Foreigners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started walking to the church in 1993, began to be discovered in greater number, and the people began to overevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the national history record in 1998.
The new single-patch book (of course named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to the re-asfalted and re-speaking Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville remains a florid anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orland can sometimes act as a falling street in the soil rain, as small as it was found with only 27 black families in the 19th century.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who are coming to look for history and significance of Eatonville, they are still advised carefully.
The authorisation for the degree of conversations is necessary to have before and certain things - as a conscious painting in the oldest etonville churches that painted whites and showed blackness on the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, courageous, self-determined teacher, who has a red network, are still afraid that their isolated community is correctly understanded.
And even as Hurston's festival increased, the householding pride also increased.
In particular, young people move to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and even stronger, creative, workful, choiced and diversified as other American races and ethnics.
From Franklin's son's voice, Edwin Harvey's eighteen-year-old son, he encourages the sincere love for the foreign when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in local government or in the police, which says she would enjoy help.
And even younger, like 11-year-old boys from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonovy, as seems, learned to describe Eatonville right.
"The majority of people, when they're just going over here, will think, "Hm, this city is nothing against those last," said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you're just gonna stop and look for a while in the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we're all talking gaseous.
Nothing changed to the first look here.
If tourists at Manhattan were kept away from newspapers and television stations at Times Square, they wouldn't realize that they stood at the storm.
They would never assume that at the exposed end, the Office's role over their heads has every day the bankiers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "worst day in the office" since the crisis from 1929.
The companions are still running with metal vehicles after trailers and transfer muffins to the dinner meeting.
His guards still move between the guards and wears, like human mules, fifty throats of whispers, which swim from the wahadel on their backs.
The office crossings still wait in front of their bagel random at the streets of food rooms, and it is still impossible to get in a total day of yellow taxi between the fourth and the seventh afternoon.
It didn't seem like a crisis until I, with all the words of pessimism, decided to put up on Wednesday afternoon.
Although I had time for this task to cover with the late afternoon seat on my local JP Morgan Chase, there were about twenty people in the front.
Not before the past windows to get up or store the preparation, but before the overview where the elderly clients are in charge of checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to trade with mixed goods with Macy's and new customers put up.
Most people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "life of personal banker", came from the same damn like me.
Yet, they have already chosen their support from smaller banks in places from where they came, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or State Island.
They have chosen money from such a claim (a little similar to building competitives), money-making and of those types of co-operators, whose shares operate only in one country and claim that they care for their customers as a family.
In the next year, 15 such banks were decreased.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, to the concurrence, and when the New Yorkians returned home on Wednesday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch a safe buyer.
The staff of offices and businesses who were standing before me and fearing another colaps, moved their ready to the bank, which is considered as a safe station, and who makes a salvation facility on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkians have learned gaseous in the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to the phone and expressed to Lehman Borthers, who was deceived, and to her devastated top executive worker Dick Fuld with such abilities as if she cared about a lined college.
And Lyn, a uniformized nearly fifty-year-old house of my boyfriend, changed the topic of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food feed.
After my visit, she told me, "I have now my support in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I'm not risking it."
Muslim graves deployed by the Rack right-break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Russian right side of the Freedoms and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian right side of Vlaams Belang, a manifestation that presented in Antvereh on Tuesday 17 January 2008 the "Cities against Islamization".
There are no cedules similar to transport marks that show mixtures in the red line.
Police accuses the right extremists of the distortion of the Muslim grave in Russia of the same weekend in which the extremely right parties have gained great benefits in general elections.
More than 90 bursts in the town of Traun near Linza were sometimes distressed between the Friday evening and this is hardly devastated, and the police are convinced that it was organized.
The guilty took some Jewish symbols, such as David's star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be trying to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred to the Muslim immigrants.
It's not fair whether this incident has been related to choices.
The speaker of the Islamic Communities said that they were "deeply shocked" reports of the disappointment that comes on the moment when the Muslim post month of Ramadán is near.
In the meantime, Croatia enters the course of seeking his own soul after the movement in the last parliamentary elections.
Both national rights parties, obtaining more than 30 per cent of votes, the Free and Swaz for the future of Russia, led a highly antiimmigration campaign and some of their slogans were critically condemned as xenophobe.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party, who received more than 18 per cent of votes, protested in the campaign against shoes and burches, and even expressed his opposite to the eggs in which the relationship with islam was taken into consideration.
At the latest meeting with the elections in Widow, he spoke about the "European Brothership" which would prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prohibit the building of mixtures and mines, and they argue that these are political symbols of the islamization of Russia and Europe.
Research and analysis conducted immediately after elections that have put extreme rights on the position of the most strong political block in the country indicate that this change was caused by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't go outside the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star sentenced for sexual injury of children, prohibited the court to travel to France and Spain.
The officers arrested this sixmonth prohibition to Glitter after informing the monitoring authority that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police was appealed to this trip on Thursday after submitting evidence to the officers of Glitter's past sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, whose own name is Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Ashford Latest Court in Kentu, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
The Court of Justice said: "The Court of Justice requested the Kentic Police for Regulations that would prohibit Mr. Paul Gad to cross the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd hasn't participated personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to the foreign, how it records him in the registry of sexual attackers.
He must notify the offices if he wants to travel to the traveller for more than three days.
The planned date must also be transmitted to the police a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the Authority was notified, it could be sentenced for five years.
The Kents police announced that it was to negotiate the individual cases of Glitter's possible routes after a period.
The Kentic Police said, "Kentic police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or in the foreign.
In our view, it is easier to follow someone who remains in British because there are extensive systems that affect potential dangers more effectively.
Protection of the Kent people is the highest priority for the Kentic police, and we carefully work on it, and they followed the conduct of sexual attackers, and thus decreased any danger for the public to minimum."
Glitter returned to British last month after he spent 27 months in the vietnamian negotiation for a misuse of two girls in 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he had to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel good, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go through the pass control and finally fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he returned to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officers continued to return to British.
On August 22, he finally reached the heathrow terminal 3 and stayed there while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridg's latest penalty court in Western London and now Scotland Yard had successfully requested a order to register him as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously in the United Kingdom for four months for the property of child pornography.
The resource from the Ministry said that Jluco, ministerial inside, is quiet and thinking that Glitter was prohibited in traveling to France and Spain.
"To catch a character, I photograph a master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - a photograph.
No support, no call or costume.
Only the essence of the big masters of flamence, rejected from the concentration on interpretation -- I just want to be freed of the expression of man or woman.
On the one hand of the artist.
On the other hand, man.
Unresolutely, if we are in private, in those moments far away from the public - then you can see the confidential gestus, the depth of a captured view or anxiety gesticulation of hands, which are unprecedentable because they are not going to go on the scene.
German Günther Bauer covers the theatrality of "Flamenco-people" with songs, dancers and cytarists with the less famous face of the masters.
With this purpose, the photograph consists of a single flamenca iconografie from different ≥ 2D.
The expression that runs in the Month Photo of Flamenca (Mes de la Photography Flamenca), "respects the growing international meaning of flamenca," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that they are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people's portraits on the street are artists able to carry out the scene of the wheat, triumph, joy... and fully catch the walls.
The personality of these artists is not needed to be captured.
They're wearing their personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a released atmosphere that allows me to catch the personality of the great flamence.
The festival "Cante de las Minas" started Bauer in 1997 with a portrait of flamenc songs, cytarists and dancers to a table camera.
These are portraits that are using the selection of cameras and materials to make a classic photograph.
The application of different rubbers is in contrast with the classic foundation of the video and provides him with the present spirit, which is the idea that Bauer alone looks and flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but does not stop to surprise and develop."
What strikes the winters is not the effect of a sole dance, song or game, but the personality and character of the artist.
Searching for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of imagination, living and living was and is the constant work presented during these days in El Fotomat gallery.
This choice of seventy photographed artists creates known flamenca positions, other than Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyo, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become such an anthology of flamenca and will soon be expected of a breast-feeding issue, which will include exhibited portraits.
Your portrait has brought Bauer to the idea of repeat the "Portretech of the Sport Veteran" ("SportART project") two years ago.
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photograph admits that "fotographing people, knowing them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only shorter, to enter into their lives -- that's my deception.
I think there's a portrait in the photo.
A man is meeting or looking at people, persons he doesn't ever know, or will give him a few minutes to focus.
Despite the similar circumstances, I'm trying to do my ideas as a photograph."
The assembly of portrets of the current flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is set up in Galery El Fotómata in the street de la Mata 20, equal to Alameda de Hércules, and may be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the Roman who writes is "troupfality"
It is played in the events that she still does not know, and she reports about the events for the unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa decided to successfully implement her new project - just working on a Romanian whose main hero is Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in Congo and traveled in Amazon.
An eternal favorite of Nobel Price will be held on the festival of Hay Festival Segovia yesterday admitted that the project that just employs it is "this is triumph", and that "this all convinces that I should not write" this Roman.
"If I had a sense, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and believe that I'm going to finish it once," he repeated my contribution to the festival of the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that I saw in the town around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The Romanian author "City and dogs" was one of the main positions of the third year's celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who obtained the price Hay Festival for the most favorite writer - the old issue of Dickens "Our mutual friend" - filled the district Juan Bravo in the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had a devoted public before him, whose hour was running as water - Peruanus with an accuracy and a notable dose of humor, as he raised in it from the "incredibly unbelievable well-belief" from "the joy of a disgraceful reader" and "the power of living more than I lived" caused literary sending; as the supplies "not enough of inspiration" by writing "disciplined", he carefully olded text, performing and overwrite; or how his writings Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and "all images" are the base of his stories.
The Spanish Romans admitted that " there is no way", how to find out whether and in what way the books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that it is only a funny, an amazing experience" - he emphasized Vargas Llosa by saying "on people" and "needs it is to try to escape from a series," and called the writers to "do not submit freedom" and "take responsibility" to their mission.
For climate, the loss of festival in Zooblancu - missing copies
The exhibition with copies that celebrate the celebration in Zooblanc was cancelled yesterday after the notifications of the claimants were confirmed that the surface of the destination was not in good condition.
Therefore, the company and Fermin Bohorquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and ́ Hernández decided to cancel the charges.
Incredible ororological submins of this festival are a period of time that two of the three celebrations could not have been successful.
On Saturday, he disabled the rain of other planned buses.
During them, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were supposed to set a bicycle in Castillblanc.
But that's how it celebrated on Friday.
Daniel Luque became a winner, who drew three ears and recompense for dynamic and steady quality exhibition was put on the arm.
On the same day afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two copies for a salute and one ear that brought him more uncovered seat than the tourist art.
More worse on that was El Julie, who passed through the big arena Los Llanos unsendted.
In the second round of the tree without a single breath, he served the island of criticism from the community.
They took controls in Alava in the supplier with two thousand kilograms of hash
In ten minutes five.
Road control of Ertzaintz in the city of Armihon (Alava).
The staff stops two persons walking in the supplier, and they care for them.
The cost, more than two tonnes of hash, isn't to stop.
According to the report of the Committee within the Baskish Government, the members followed and detained one of the persons who walked in the supplier, men in 38 years, identified as A.A.J.
He was detained by the feeding of drugs and the falsification of state documents.
The incident occurred when a number of members of the Transport Unit carried out a road control at N-1 in the places where the urban circuit of Armihon is passed.
They wanted to stop the delivery after the controller, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, the driver took up and took away.
The car customers started to shoot immediately when the vehicle stopped a few kilometers along the coast, both passengers sprang out and fled to the forest.
End of one of them, Ertzaints finally met and entered 2 178 kilograms of hashiche, who were suspicious to transfer, as it appeared in the view of the delivery of Iveco Daily.
The back part of the vehicle was loaded by the hash packages that were then transferred to other police divisions to detailed expertise and drug weight.
Furthermore, the police found that the recognition mark is "incorporated" and does not agree with the data listed in the delivery documents, therefore, it was also charged with false state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to follow the second suspicious, who, as already mentioned, has been able to flee so that it can finally be determined as a matter of entertainment of drugs.
A. A. A. J., 28 years old, has been transferred to the police office to establish appropriate formalities before the next monitoring is reached.
Heather Locklear Heather Retained for the driving under the effect of the medicine
Heather Locklear, favorite Amanda from Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for the driving under the effect of medicines.
The Witness saw her conducting unusual manevas when she tried to get out of the park in Montecito, communicated the newspaper People speaking Californian Road Watch.
The Witness explained that about 16.30 p.m.. Locklear's spring was thrown into gas, for a sound bullet, and was trying to get out of the parking place - when she was throwing up the sun's bullet sometimes.
A Witness who wasn't going to leave the box first, saw Locklear's moment after he stopped in a nearby distance and went out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the salvation service because she was "free of Locklear's life".
When the police guard arrived in the place, she found a lock inside the vehicle that partly locked the driving.
"It looked disoriented," and therefore the members brought it to a specialized drug and alcohol center to detail the test.
According to the police speaker, the excessive quantity of alcohol was exhausted, however, "We believe Locklear was under the influence of drugs, which was evident to the guards in the first view."
Locklear was arrested for suspiciousness under the effects of the non-specific substance and approximately 19.00 was taken into the link, although it was released for freedom for a few hours.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the clinical treatment, where she was dismissed from the urgency and depression.
Llamazares is based on the andalual IU association to apply its powers in the box of Silva
The General IU and the United Left Deputy Gaspar Llamazares reported today that the final decision in the case of the former Council Board of Youth and the Sport Board in Seville Francisca Manuela Silvy, who went out of the office last week after he was accused of negotiating in the benefits of his family, will depend on the national association of the Party.
"I am a too federalist, and is on the Daulaus organization to apply its power," Llamazares said the deal to which the party will have to join in relation to the former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the leader IU held that, in the case of investigation of the illegal proceedings which Silva had permitted, it was absolutely necessary to "transparency": "IU's fighting for similar matters to be extremely transparent."
He also highlighted that the side has "strecked ethical code for all publics".

José Luis Garci in the "Sangre de Mayo" film, who inspired Episodes from the national past of Benita Pér·Galdos, lives the glorious rise of Spain against the French - this is the most ambitious movie in his filming with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "screen the explanation of the position and analysis of the company", which he wondered in the work of a glorious romanopisce, explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevary during the presentation of the picture before a large team of interpreters.
The flower blood with metrage over two and a half hours will be introduced into the cine this Friday and in the future more than four hours for Telemadrid TV series.
As a big literary creationist of Galdose José Luis Garci, he claimed to fulfil the "child dream", which thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who believed him three years ago in the Autonomous province of Madrid by turning the picture to the twoth year of Madrid 2 May, he accepted the offer with the exhibition of the Epizod of the national past.
The beginning of 15 millions, which completely contributed to the Madrid province, means to Garci's "unique opportunity" to create a cocktail with the coasts and coasts corresponding to the image of the "third Spanish, which was missing in the leader for whom it was to fight - the battle for independence led to the government of Ferdinanda VII to fall and the rest of the country," he introduced.
The Regissor, however, regrets that he can't calculate the financial support that has been obtained to the films Smuggling wheel (Ala triste) or Goyo's miracles - a double part of flower blood -, so he could not turn some scenes from the scenario signed rather than Horacium Valcarcell, with which he works at the whole of his movie road.
The recorder of the film "Restart again" (Volver and empezar) works as currently usually - on a scene with hers, with which it is usually testing before the hit and who does not choose the casting, because it seems "needing" and also believes that "the part of the register's call is to go to the divadel and kine and so to know what's going on in the field that kills".
Many herds who have chosen for Blood Blood are already presented before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations on Oskar, one of whom he received, is the view that no one of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the same Blood, the Seven Desktops of the French Billard and the last chosen Sleep Solar, represents a young generation of the Spanish movie scenes, but states that "this will only be revealed".
The Garci film doesn't expect any evaluation.
"You think first you're working for what you're going to be, but then you'll realize that you're working only for the cost, and then you're going to make another movie more," explains Garci with a 30-year register career.
Isabel Bayón’s spirit survives a link to the Sevilla Dance Tortoly Valencia
The Sevill dance flamenca gives another sevil dance hold.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florenz Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the fourth Trian, and when it was three years, they moved with their family to London.
She danced a modern dance and focused on the eastern dance.
She experienced life full of harmfulness, a female emancipation, such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and struggle for the distortion of the currency that caused women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the Dance and Estatic Revolution of the Intergovernmental Europe of Isabele Bayon, was taught by the Isabele Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepou and she gave me this position -- it seemed incredible."
According to the dance, we're not about the story of her life, but about the breathing of the soul.
The names of her dance representations made me a flamenca rite.
So "motil dance" evoked me a guajir or a hair dance.
Her dance was sensible and they told me that my dance of this stetch also corresponds," he says.
The representation is calculated by two exceptional characteristics: with Miguel Conduct, which Isabele will in one exhibition sing as in the "Opened doors" (La Porta Opena), and with the artist of the dance Matilde Coral, who made an exception and approached to cooperate with her former jacket.
"Matilde represents the elder Turtle, a worm.
I'm glad she's accepted the offer to share my project, and it's a great honor for me."
It also counts with music and cytars of Jesuse Torres and Ariagy, sing Miguela Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Moron; El Pájara bubny, violate Rafa El Violy and cooperative herds of Juanfry Juárez, "which has a role of this kind of artist, which are primidonates with all and who are in love with them".
It also takes into account the lives of this woman, who played for its time in such a distance place as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she habitually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she was of those women who had a serious impact at some time, but today no one knows her and then even less appreciates her creation," said Bayon.
The presentation begins today at 20:30 in the Lope de Vegy divadle.
The book "The Housing Day of Married" concludes trienals
The introduction of the first illustrated edition "Dany of the Holy March" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed the record with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the coordinated Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government for the celebration of "Trinale Zenobie and Juana Ramóna" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of celebrating the fifty-year award of Nobelovy the price for their death.
"Trinale Zenobie and Juana Ramóna" goes to the end of the new issue of this work, the international convention that will be held in New York, the rule of Nobel's Museum House and the route of the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen parsek suns", which was opened in April this year, and after the various provinces of Andalu, it should be moved to New York according to the plans during the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalual Government also negotiated eight hundred prints of the "Dany of the Housing of Married" adjusted by Peter Tabernar and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to broadcast the knowledge of personality and parts of one of the most worldwide parts of the Palestinian basic bases.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like it so much.
"Everytime, God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the herds of Sally Field, who cooperated with him on "Son evil intention" and under the thought that Newman went away, discovered his unconforted vision of abandoned American cinematography and all America.
Look how long they were before Oskar got.
And that he was income since 2007.
And it thought he was hardly sick.
Still, he was a guy.
"Always what man feels can't be exhausted in any way, and I've now lost a big friend," Robert Redford said in his tears, "my life and my country were better grateful to him."
Nobody was afraid he'd be funny or overcome.
The father of the movie and authority died especially in dark time in fear of terrorists and financial markets, at the time of the American self-consciousness at the bottom when they are looking for haughty.
When the time is drunken and people without honour and only the worst of those who deserve you amazing - it doesn't need to be Luis Cernud, and they loved Paul Newman.
For all of us, he's almost a platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was the official resistant of Richard Nixon and the fight for lost and lost cases, from the transmission against drug dependency based on the honor of the firstborn son who died for overdose, until the label of home food and biofuture.
A complete treasure for the land, which has been a lot of efforts to forgive self-mortal food culture.
Hollywood was driving a whale without regard to nationality or state responsibility.
Last James Bond, English Daniel ́ig, found that not one man died, but a whole ear.
Another Englishman, Oskar's officer, Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Crowe, trooped Newman to mark as his greatest source of inspiration.
"It's a nicely high ladder to all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the small ones who today has courage to try to live as Paul Newman lives - based on respect and leads a serious private life far away from the camera.
It's not easy in the medical jungle today, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are and Paul Newman is their pattern.
He was divorced once, and since that time he was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was unfair, although he had more than enough opportunity to be.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I got a filet home?" he shot.
Let him be proud in heaven, that he will rule between his daughters and wonderful ones on earth -- that is not too running in America.
It is said, "of all the great roles he has taken was the most smart in the role of the devoted husband, loved father, voluntary grandparent and sacrificed philantrop."
Incomplete olympics of Madrid
Yes, many of us wish to make olympias in Madrid, and after 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we're going to run the train yesterday, I'm saying, no!
It was talking about him as a perfect bathroom, and according to my court, it was the worst I had ever been on.
Such a snake of uncertainty that if the evaluation occurred and I was testing, it would be not enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty one after another.
Insight begins with the introduction of a classical number for which a person must grow before.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but when a man goes there, they give him everything (which is a chip that has to be before the overflow of the road).
But no.
Here a man had to take up the number first (with unconsciousness, go there only for that) and (as the departure of the relevant front) - what surprise! - they had only a trick of size S (three insensitive, because I have the XL size).
Where are we living?
That's because of the crisis, they've decided to buy only a small truck because it's less than a substance and they're more nice?
All right, they're a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the bathroom.
Besides that it had to go very quickly for the chip and the front on it was over 15 minutes, he had to move the bathroom there.
Over 35 minutes there was a waiting time, which is on the train where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So how it could be expected, the bathroom started, and we haven't left the bathrooms yet, and when it's been done, it's been much worse.
Moreover, waiting for 40 minutes of rain, leading to general rebellion and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have tomorrow an interest in the cup and some like me will not show the right time to evaluate the results for the chip that they gave me and which, as I guess, did not indicate me the right time of start.
Of course, if someone asks me about a perfect bathroom, this wouldn't attack me.
So I think we're gonna have to let us think of a well-prepared olympical city.
Microsoft searches for reception (virtual)
In the new MIT, Microsoft introduced further development in the new system of recognition of images and human interactions in the way of artistic intellectuality - not too intelligent but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, the action that would move through the whole area of the company) and the things they hear in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and system that recognises faces and faces, this "receptive" can find how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they have - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It is also able to classify presents according to conference groups.
In the demonstration video, receipt is designated by the third person and it understands that it does not belong to the group that speaks with it and that it is not the employer of the company.
She's asking if she's going after someone, and she's reporting that she's gonna be renewed in a minute.
It's all without a blue screen of death.
Excellent.
But, of course, it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things at work, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
This week has been a lot talking about the change of Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and ability to have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers only had the most necessary, without the cause of commercial insolvency, they would be five times more effective - man, Steve, they'll be more nice.
Revelation as a crom when we consider that Microsoft version of the version adds to Windows new and another "extra".
The change in the measurement would be a worth action.
Microsoft has the right, the operational system is slowly losing significance and it is similar to that software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who join the theory that it was the first step of Googlu to competition with Windows.
Many have correctly shown that the browser is not a operational system.
The operational system will be necessary because it is necessary to understand between hardware and software.
He has the same thing as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to you.
That's true.
He never disappears, but we need to think of the "death" of the operational system, not as absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People keep more attention to the operational system and rather to the Internet browser.
The computer is enabled to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spent more time every day than around the window.
What are the half of the systems used to be used?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering his online services and finally become an alternative to Googla.
They've seen it, and I've got a little example here.
I made this photo in a vacation for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of a month.
On a drinking machine, it was a plaque that asks them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used to search on the Google Internet.
Last week confirmed the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come to beginning 2009, but at the end, let's calculate until 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone becomes more than the computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay of the dragon.
The Fabuloso Marcel
Paul Picasso was carrying it on the Azur coast, once in the "Cerve Diamond" Edward Zwick, as Al ́ino in "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniform of the swallowed gay communities.
And if we want to go into the calculation of his life roles, we can go down to the image of a typical rubber with a bullet bullshit that lifts the effects in a rock circle.
In fact, nothing is more than the typical bathroom of the lady's underground, adjacent and without hands.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels comes over all the rest.
First for his cruel name - even when people call him "Marcel" - which has a relationship with sport, because, as the legend states, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of the song Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' appears over the final quality bathroom, unisex with a strike, distinguishing the shitke and (thereafter an unknown) Belgian flag, which has the models of non-emblematicer tickets as detail in the neck.
And watch, because the Belgian company is not only specialized for tank tops.
It also produces mykins college, back boxers, cashmire bullets, bathrooms, marine truck, clothes for children, mini bills...
Thinking bags for a pleasant underwear.
Although it's damage to be just the bottom.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, whoever is a father, he doesn't care."
The horrible shape of her sister doesn't prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica is a woman full of life.
Their new actions in mode now are very serious.
For Monica, this means much more than just that beautiful, famous girls will give their name.
In Paris, the promotion action that Mango organized in its new seat and the statement of the most significant modal prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's hearty and unfortunate, and she'll get you near.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that we had with Sister Penélope on Mango on an anniversary underground in the winter, and I also participated in the statement of the second year's "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Oper for Valentina.
So it was an enormous, but at the same time, and an exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango, for whom you're working for?
My sister and I love films from the 50s and 60s, and we have had a lot of highlights.
I also get too much too busy through the city and watch women how they walk in clothing, combining and leveling their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, a kidney, a big awesome woman, isn't you?
I think so, but the end of the end is all connected and has a lot of connection.
Maybe I liked clothes quickly, I still wanted to go to my grandmother, look at her clothes in my tante's boxes and look at her dress.
It was a sense, almost better than going to the valley.
Then, when I became a danceman, I tried to take care of how I was dressed.
But you know that we dancers are based on how we are adapting, and at our hours and tests, they felt well in view of the mirror.
And as a kid, when they give you a bone, then you'll get into the station.
So everything is connected, but with great respect to the professionals and professionals.
You've been 30 years ago, have you got a crisis?
Goodbye.
I'm feeling better than ever before, three-thirds have fun.
I find that the woman's ready, my experience, and my life's getting out of my mistake.
The biological hours don't scare me.
I'm doing what I want, and that gives me a great internal happiness.
So you're thinking to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'm a mother because my body asks it, and I want to be a young mother, I don't want to cut it out.
It's about my father, I don't care about it.
But one thing I know, I'm sure, I'll give my child a life of happiness and I'll educate him with great love.
It's about the movie, you're waiting for a couple of film premises that you've touched.
It's so, and I'm glad they're coming into the cinema.
I'm coming out of the wonderful world, so I'm very unbecoming and unbecoming, I want everything right now, and of course it's not going.
I'm pleased at the Premier "The Last Hour" and "En search de la tumba de Christ".
Appreciatively, how they'll like you...
A few days ago, you had your president on the supervisory mole at Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going to get to the molo like a model.
Only called me Naomi Campbell, which I already know, and invited me to London to participate in the benefital reviews for her organization "Feeds for Better Life" and clothes that we had predicted - I chose two models from our collection for Mango - and the outcome was transmitted to this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
It's talking about her, and I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll keep the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to make a good job, but if she asked me to make a stone, I'll do it too.
In the benefit of the third world's women, I'll do what you need.
The drivers repeatedly have to install "alcohol" with alcohol in the blood.
The Ministry requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for the operation under alcohol influence in his vehicle install a system that will prevent him from starting a vehicle in drinking or if he does not breathe.
It has already come to know in June this year and now it is included in the annual report of the Highest State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that takes one year.
His goal is to return the drivers to the voter, therefore the drivers will also have to determine the course of transportation.
In this experience, the National Transport Safety Authority (DGT) and the Technology Safety Foundation (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to 30 to 75% of cars accused of more than once for re-driving drinking in this state, they are used as a volant.
Alcolock should prevent it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures alcoholic cold in the respiratory air and prevents the start of the car if the driver does not breathe before or if it is mentioned above the allowed alcohol concentration.
His price is over 1000 euros and it must be a vineyard.
In this regard in the United States in 2007, it showed that the transition was reduced by 65 % in vehicles equipped with this equipment during the first year following the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people could be saved every year.
The measures are limited to the administrative sanction of two days: to resolve this behaviour before the offence.
And in order to help its implementation, since legal adjustment is my way of conducting, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires amendment of law.
The installation is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though it has already been tested in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow the Congress will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Working Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With Britain accuracy, in 17,40 hours, as was held in the programme, the airport of Benita Juárez at Mexico D. F. was accompanied by the Prince and Princesa from Asturi.
The sun just fell down, however, his papers had yet made it to clothe their hands so that my eyes could be looking at the following a couple coming out of the aircraft.
Under the meetings, the Spanish commander and other guardians stood.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi officers if he knew the Spanish Prince with Princess comes to a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, that's the time that it's going to get to the airport to get people out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Mexican print, however, well knows who are princess and princess of Asturia and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the aircraft in a hangar closely at a red cow and a military cordon that creates 27 marine soldiers prepared to shoot a honest salve.
The prince appears with a smile on lips in dark blue and princess dressed, very coolly dressed and with witched hair, has not its habitual "peeptoes", it obviously reports that the storm is threatened in D. F.
Before they go to the room where the official delegation is waiting, they laugh at photographs and are unnecessaryly supporting them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be held, one of the four largest in the city, a mexican television reporter waits for them.
Best achieved moderate price
There's probably no more appropriate place in the world to declare a modal price than Paris and it's probably not a more significant bovine and bonavivane than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation to new talents in mode.
The price is amounted to EUR 300 000.
Sandrina Fasoli, the victory of the first year, watched her in Manga's output on the Paris bulvary Housesmann number 54 and weeped at the end of the time.
Of course, this is the second largest trade in this company in Europe, and it has just been opened to the area of 1 335 feet quadrimeters.
The biggest is located in London.
A lot of tasks together with the desire to thank Valentino's complainants for the chairmanship of the concurrence reports caused us to finally rejoice at the Paris Oper Garnier.
Company Mango, a celebrated president's table, looked close to the most famous Chagall works.
Nati, who with the heart of a broken lamentation because of her brother's recent death, did not find anything, dressed the clothes of this label and the ELAH shoes on which the breath was hidden, and was locked to her son Louise - a double-meter elgane - made Valentina in the head of the table at his ears at his ear.
Andik, Mango's boss and owner, was welcomed and as a real gentleman stayed with the Rothschild baron without sack, because they both offered them to two ladies.
The monkey, who reached the trade in - own-handly proposed - bullets and couchs and dinner dressed into long black clothes, took a night walk after Oper after Goyi Toled's delivery, showed us the sal for ballet tests and, when we were able to take one of the tissues and indicated "grand plague".
Ines Sastre's not held on a watch after the next building of the palace, but she showed us her son at the mobile phone before it was leaving.
On the second day we could love the presence of Oliver Martínez - another young man who runs on the engine - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own clothes and handhelds and asked before that no voice was used in his rooms.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001 - Anti-stress Number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and chaosing life everyday.
And so that it doesn't be a little bit, they're all cut into one book that will bring into the booking relax on September 30.
The beach calls every hour in 7 hours as a punishment, but it is worse to imagine himself in a successful rythme that brings the present life.
The office is called pressure and the computer's pain behind.
Stress is the illness of the 21st century.
There are, however, no one or two methods to fight everyday exhaustity and problems to respond from the world’s work.
No, that number isn't worse and nothing less than 100.
Susannah Marriotva, outside the jogging position, classic massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of his book, stored the entire "menu" options adapted according to the whisper and time options of each individual.
The Protistres book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring silence into the bookbuilding.
If someone has the idea that it is unable to achieve peace in such work or personal relations, "man" supports this view.
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% of natural recepts that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't have adrenalin in the grass, which is re-equality in the body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the cup, disable and concentrate on the square.
Speaking from sleep
Some kids are talking tonight.
I don't think those who'll wake up and tell us what happened before the day, but the kids who's talking when they're sleeping.
When this happens first, you may be healed, but in the sense it's insignificant.
It's an injury of sleep, called dream.
She's generally frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
No one of you told you that he was talking about sleep tonight.
This jew can be produced very radically (e.g. one time for life at high horn) or more regularly (dayly, once per week, once per month...), the second day does not remember anything.
There's not only one d'you that would explain her approach.
It is often connected to other slaughter disorders, such as nightmare, nightmare, enuresis of nutrition (night assistance) or insurance, but it must not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it may often produce very high heat, stress or disturbance.
In any case, it's a little tested evidence.
The intensity that it appears is also different.
The child can speak with a quiet voice, speak individual words, sheptate, or just inverse (scream, weeping, long words...).
In cases of great strength, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult the expert to find out whether there is no problem that causes a big uz and thus occurs.
We said that it was an injury, so it is not only treated if it is associated with another slaughter breach that can be treated (e.g. if it comes with a apnea syndrome or constant stress).
However, we can do that we will remember a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to let the child get too disappointed before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scared or somehow violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who are able to be released, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them get some internal calm.
This kid's gonna make a calmer sleep.
When a dream is shown, try to keep it quiet.
Remember that the child is injurious and that the second day it will never remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't be aware of him.
It's incredible because it's not at home, and you'll stop his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Remember, if you seem to be very painful sometimes after you, it would be appropriate to handle the advice or to find out what the child calls for such an urge.
If you understand what he says (which is not so habitual), avoid the trial to listen to him and get out of the information.
It's not going to be anything, because when she sleeps, it's not the way he can arrange ideas.
Moreover, you can hear what he says, but you don't know what he sees, and then why he says it, so watch how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're doing.
Never tell the kid that you can ask him about his secret tonight.
Don't be funny.
That's a big uz.
Don't worry shortly, it's nothing wrong, it's just the episode that takes only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found the way to win.
Without providing specially a big story, the yellows created more chances and could change one of them victoryly.
The game did not have too much time during this screen, where the attackers were only hard to work.
After the first trial of the guest Kauffmann, who shot from the distance only on the floor passed a band, began to have Illhaeusern lightly proposed and first founderflick from the distance, then Hirne with air, Romein on the feet or Diebold gradually came to follow the defense of Dannemarie.
The opposite placed a defence valley in the midst of the wall and left only the Agel Riahi on the floor of the attack.
The beginning of the second half appeared as a decision, first by the two chances of Dannemarie named Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais was concerned, well-determined for the processing of the sword reflected after the previous Diabold trial (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusernu did not have happiness, about twelve minutes later, he was required to return to the clothes and thus leave his partners in weakness.
However, Dannemari couldn't get out of this, and the eleventh from Illhaeusern, who just stood a little bit to "build" the defense, which has no longer affected any more difficulties, except the last seconds of the storage when the bottle passed very close to March.
Sarcose is to meet wrathed fishers
Before going to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make an invasion through the British.
In order to determine the demonstration of fishermen's forces that broke the accession of several British and Normand ports on Monday, the French president decided to release the Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday to meet their representatives there.
The final names promised that he would accept "in the spirit", and they hope "come with specific nayes".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the Value of the "Christ Committee" established by the British fishermen in order to achieve measures against an increase in the price of oil, which reached the top of over 1,14 euros per litre.
According to the speaker of the Elysian Palace David Martinon, the President "will talk to them about the solutions that can be presented to help their companies re-acquire competitiveness and better ensure the employment and payment of mariners."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishers with inaccessibility.
On Wednesday, the operations of "slow-leaving vehicles" were carried out in the departments Morbihan and Calvados, which caused a 10km of the department.
The recreational station in Quiberon was also locked, but the connections to Belle Island were not interrupted.
A filtering game was carried out on the middle of Quiberon.
The soldiers have shown their determination on Monday when they immediately burned the pans and palettes in Brest and Lorient, immediately before the departure funds, while they were in Concarneau and Saint-Brie.
The movement was extended to other places on the coast of Atlantic and Channel la Manche, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trauries remained in the coast, or Le Havro, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of trade ships.
Fishers from Turball and Croisica in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the blocking of important raffineries in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait before they decide to act at the central meeting of the Ministership.
In Guilvinecu, on Wednesday, the "Christ Committee" is to decide how to continue on the slow road, and how to attend the prepared meeting for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Board of fisheries who did not support their movement.
"The staff will continue" because "fishers will not leave anything" and "not want to go to Paris", for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Committee on Fishing in Lorient.
However, fishermen who do not pay oil tax are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, condemning that the powder of ship value is achieved only if the oil is under 0,30 euros per litre.

AIG considers the 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insurer, whom the American Financial Times had received over water, considers that he would provide more than 15% of his assets to pay 85 billion dollars to him as a resource, writes a Sunday Financial Times issue.
The AIG is ready to examine the sales of its activities outside the international field and income activity in the United States, indicating the journal which indicates the sources of nearby proceeding.
The AIG Management Board, according to FT, met on Sunday evening to examine the eventual procedure.
The AIG could not obtain any confirming declaration.
The assets that AIG intends to be released include his aeroplane Leasing International Lease Financial Corp., 59% of its assets in the transatlantic Holdings ensuring, as well as its portfolio of invalidity and investment in private equity, adds FT.
No final decision on these procedures has yet been adopted, FT continues.
The AIG must be able to pay 85 billion loans, which the Federal Reserve Bank has given him with the risk that the American authorities feed 80% of him, which, at the same time, distinguishes the proportion of the current shareholder.
Analysis of the historical Morning Meeting meeting
New York Burza mentioned the historical decline on Monday after Paulson's representatives refused to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, which is an unseen loss close to 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) passed by 777,68 points on 10 365,45 points.

From the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally passed after the unexpected refusal of the Bank's Representatives' backing plan, a plan that would have been allowed to resume a little stability on the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide a secretary of the State stock to Henry Paulson's request.
Two of the three republy rejected his plan.
"It's a bad market signal that sees that the Congres is not able to adopt a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza's opinion of FTN Financial.
"It shows how powerful it has been on this market plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted for a few days would not come "too late."
"If this project is condemned..., the staff will be submitted to the Feder (American Central Bank, etc.) and to the final central banks to bless the crisis, which would increase the credit submissions," warned Brian Bethune, leader of the Global Insight Economy.
And with a view to the importance of Piegza, the fact that in the United States, "one new day, one financial institution is falling."
After Friday, Washington Mutual organized the banking offices of Wachovia bank activity with its citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took turns and requested an improper intervention in the benefits of the banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Island and Germany, which indicates that the markets are not "one with the American crisis, but with the world crisis", added an analysis from the FTN Financial.
The market with the obligations has been strongly deteriorated.
The tissue of the 10-year rate increased to 3,632 % over 3,827 % on Friday evening, the expenditure of 30 years to 4,161 % over 4,357 % in the previous day.
Obama wined points in the first television dull
After the first Friday debat between both candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, whose task was to find out who of John McCain and Barack Obama wined.
Republican and democracy campaigns were not surprised when they both announced their victory in a television division that followed a third of the American families.
The political analysis of David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, as he was right, was not enough "brilliant" to allow him to stop, five weeks before presidential elections, decreased in investigations.
Gallup’s constitution, whose investigation of the public opinion published on Saturday, convicted to Obam the five-fourth salt (49 % against 44 % for McCaina), judges that the democracy is the victory.
Among the undetermined electors who are rightly concerned, Obama is a winner for 39% of the questioned, while, according to CBS, 25% grants the victory to McCain.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm its leadership on Thursday through the proposed good execution of Joseph Biden's colleague, during the first and the only public debate with Sarah Palina's support.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's sent, however, warned about the weekend of Bill Clinton.
The seventeenth McCain systematicly highlighted his imperative experience in the policy field, highlighting the "naivity" of his opposite in the issues of the nuclear of the first center.
"Sounds like Senator Obama didn't understand..." sounded repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to be president," he also assured.
In such a attacking spirit, the republican television meetings have not been taken from yesterday.
In contrast, both pointed out that it represents the future.
He didn't turn his head off and showed himself as artificial and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the good news of the United States world.
"McCain has not yet understood while Obama's yes," he replied on a democracy meeting weekend, which deems to the Republican that it does not take sufficiently the impact of the crisis on the "current American".
"In the 90-minute debate John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama declared yesterday before 20,000 people held at the Preference Meeting in North Carolina for the rain.
He didn't even express the words as "central class" or "worker". The financial division simply benefits Obam, which the Americans consider to be more motivated to save the economy in the area of loss.
"The next week it could be a decision to return," he considered the impact of the Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama to the "economic prospect" that Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of democracy is the current funeral of "the final value of the eight-year-old bad economic policy, how George Bush operated it and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois reaffirmed that through the unexpected Wall Street hoppes, he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of the Americans, and he also noted that the implementation of the eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy resources is a number of priorities, together with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain plans to rebuild a park with 45 nuclear electrics by 2030.
Both candidates were cautiously dismissed by questions relating to the financial assistance plan by $700 billion (470 billion euros), which adopted the Congress yesterday night and which was strongly unfair.
"What are you, have you noticed that there were some choices in Minsk?"
Young people and opposers of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarus capital to refuse the outcome of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundreds of Belarus were stored on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of election rooms at the main place in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections in Parliament.
Although no results have been reported yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenk's regime: "dictator, demisi".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections, "What would it be if they were to do with my voice as they wanted to," said one young man.
It does not believe that this scheme, which has maintained the privacy to the foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to achieve the direction of democracy.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of viewing for 40 white-rush farmers and the freezing of some actives, may be canceled if the options of observers are considered clean.
According to the opposition, it wasn't like that.
"We were kept away from election committees and our observers were not supposed to reach the number of votes," Juri Potémkin, the speaker of the Democratic Power Union, reached the twelve-party group.
"It's about the cosmetic change," stressed Alexander Milinkievič, former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leads the personality of the pro-European movement, "for it's essential who counts the voices and we have the power of exercise.
If the opposition lawyers get to Parliament, they will be appointed and will never be chosen.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean space in television, meetings in regions and laws."
The opposition is therefore obliged to work politically because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
If our economy, deeply debt in Russia, reaches the crisis and we do not reform, it threatens us to become a Russian protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election progress, does not declare the elections valid.
It emphasizes that it seems too high and that the general introduction of the preliminary vote (26 % of the electors in Minsk) has opened the way with all possible manipulations.
"What are you, have you noticed that there were some choices?" asked the social-democracy leader Alexander Ko'in, one of the last two political arrangements released in August this year.
"It wasn't even a foot in the election rooms.
And in Parliament there will be at least five opposition commitments, those who are most pronounced by the regime."
The night's silence was rebuilt in the output of October.
At television, President Lukašenko and members of the Centre of Elections are welcomed to success.
Conversation - Blood that is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary arrest yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine Decary, was rightly glad, since Hema-Quebec became one of the most ineffective and ineffective blood suppliers in the world.
Moreover, he received the confidence of the public that was seriously disturbed after scandal with contaminated blood in the 80s and 90s.
As generally known, the state reserve of blood managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 80 years.
In the light of this drama and the prompt public, the Canadian Government began in February 1994 a public investigation to which the President of Judge Horace Krever had to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a burst would not be repeated anymore.
While Judge Krever revoked the report, some provinces introduced a committee with the aim of planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Géline's committee took place this role.
After Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who had to host Quebec, and the Canadian Kre-Community to resource all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of people were still trusted in the chebec creation system," says Dr. Decary.
"The situation was incredible.
With a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continuous work in this area during the following years, we have re-established the trust of the public," he adds proudly that at the beginning of 2008, Hema-Quebec has already trusted 94% of the Quebec population.
However, Dr. Decary doesn't deny that "the confidence is something very cruel."
From 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of attention.
"When we were witnesses in Europe for a number of cases of human characteristics of foolish animal disease, new variants of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says a woman leading from 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
Therefore, we are oppressed by one of the basic recommendations of Krevera and Gélineau's reports, according to the case that we don't know it and when there is a serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is indicated inevitably leading to death, is necessary to take exclusive measures.
In April 1999, we rejected blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safe evidence that this blood disease was transferred.
So this episode showed us that the principle of attention was meaningful."
In 1999, there was much more precise technology for HIV virus detection on the market: tests using nuclear acid (NAT), which enabled to discover directly the presence of the single virus in the presentation of the presentation of the single virus, and not the presence of the anti-tests on which the tests were used before.
The NAT tests have been allowed to reduce the deep period that occurs between the time of the patient and the moment when our technicals in the blood can be discovered by the first virus, explains the specialist.
This period we've been able to decrease for less than a week.
We have thus decreased the risk that some donors could be punished without the right to do so, and without that they could come to it.
This improvement enabled a significant decrease in the risk of AIDS through transfusion.
The risk that blood gets contaminated HIV is currently exposed to one of the 12 million people.
"With other words, it means that before someone hit HIV, it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood products.
In view of this, Hema-Quebec distributes annually 400 000 to 500 000 blood products, it will be required 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission to blood product is revealed.
I think we can be able to get a completely quiet or prescribe blood transfusion that is necessary to cure," says the Hema-Quebec leader.
"The call for the next decades is to keep our products' security.
We never know what kind of sickness element can be revealed in the system.
Just last year, on the island of Reunion, the chikunguna virus appeared, which is similar to the west Nil virus transfers into the blood by the throat.
It must be constantly careful," Dr. Decary continues and emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also count with sufficient resources.
"They need to grow because the population is old.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often have a new dose of red blood or blood tissues.
The age of the population has also effects on the blood gifts network, which is consistently consisting of only 3% of the Quebecs authorised for gifts."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of permission, but can only give blood once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of the offered blood has not been accepted in prospect, for example, because they are AIDS or Malaria carriers, and if they have visited the country where the bathrooms are set out, they have been released for a year.
"The 3% we can keep the status that corresponds to the needs of diseases.
The lack is very rare.
However, the members of the network of gifts must be supplemented relatively to how old and cannot give blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to maintain and encourage them to become regular gifts.
Life is so unexpected today that we can only find a few times a hour, and they could offer blood," Francine Decary will find it.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec is not only added to products but also to human weight, such as bone transplants, heart clothing, eye bulves and skin, which are almost exclusively used for large consumption.
These weights are analyzed, processed and congeled before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood bank from the puppet pigs in Quebec.
The powder, which was previously considered as biomedicin waste, produces blood with richness on staff cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
"For a few weeks ago, we celebrated the input of our thousand blood samples from puppets to the bank, and we assume we will take them over thousands of years ago.
At the beginning of the next year, they had to begin to offer transplantation," declared Dr. Decary, which described the blood reception program from the puppet pig as a very favorite.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to him," because Hema-Quebec has not enough to offer this complex and dear program to all the diseases in Quebec.
Football - Impact in Semifinale
Impact Montréal was yesterday on the Saputo stadium during the second and equal to the determining quarter final played for the total number of players, in the semifinal round, the sequence of the first USL division, thanks to winning 3:1 (4:3 is a balance for both stocks) over Sounders from Seatl.
Legal Antonio Ribeiro gave a decision in 90 minutes.
After both side-free first half of them, David Testo and Rocco Plan were sent in two remaining shower formations.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could consult Matt Jordan in the benefit of Sounders.
Remember that on Friday, during the first of the two quarter-final stocks, Impact suffered in Starfire Complex in Tukwile at Seattle of Defence 2: _BAR_
Impact measures in the semifiral of its force with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder compared the deficit 3:1 in the household, and finally wined 4:3, however, Whitecaps passed into a semifinal wheel with total number of 5:4.
Impact should be contacted with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details about a series of stocks will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's victory
By the attacking three Canadians, it is ready to start.
A unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomáse Plecance and Andree Kosticina last night in the Centre Bell encouraged the attack on the victory of Canadian 3:2 on the private shops.
Costic, the biggest star of shooting, shot ≥, the Plekaner shot two assistants, and Kovalev shot one in this fourth tricolor victory of six prepared stocks.
Kovalev wins by giving the only one during the single travels.
"I'm not ready yet," he warned Russia.
"I need another truck to feel good."
"In the first third he tried to get too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"I think he's evaluated the end of the storage.
He had a nice shot."
Charest is going north
The Prime Minister does not exclude that he will call for preliminary options until the end of the year
Once the Liberal Party (Parti Liberal) ended, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left) is candidated in today's supplementary elections.
"Remove our last large north border": such is the ambitious ambition that Jean Charest represented last night in a visually flexible way in the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, but he did not share details.
During his speech, the images were spread behind his back in some image moon.
On three rounded plates, a mixed with watchful photos of hydroelectrical playbacks, down, Quebec from the "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great-scale, like in a pre-optional period.
At the printer, finally, the Prime Minister refused to claim that he would make preliminary options on the ground, even when he warned that he had a very purchased program.
The North Plan is the fourth dimension of the "visus", which the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, see the "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on the work of force, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the agreements with Ontario.
Despite the opening of North - northern territory to the 49th equivalent - the Prime Minister was often mentioned in his announcements, it was never the subject of the presentation yet.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North represents "the curse with a great potential", but he did not introduce the term, investment and the priority in future projects.
It has mostly changed the number of access to points that could be further divorced: in particular water electricity, forests, but in particular the remote sector, encouraged by growth in developing countries and renewal of public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest's calculation, it includes "nickle, zinc, ear, platin, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamants".
This "ground two times more than France is with us," "he's in Quebec.
And not only with us, but it's in us," he stressed as he wanted to show that it was called a certain national basement myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to North, highlighted the Prime Minister: the hunga for gold in Abitibi, the chebecking engineering, James' battle.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theaterically silenced to see a huge map behind his backs.
North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Quebec requested, declared the premium during the printing.
"It is a traditional position that repeated all relevant governments.
There is a employment line that no longer exists in the Convention, and if the opportunity occurs, this position is again in the name of the Government," he said.
Otherwise, "is related to climate changes, too, to think of our vision of North," he stated when he talked about the north-western transition, which will be opened throughout the year as a result of the kidnapping of the kidneys.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that to take the territory is committed.
And what about the people of the territory, the people of the nations and the Inuité?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful for them and that the project would be successful, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-pequist lawyer from Hungary), have already started negotiations with about 30 communities.
The Interministerial Committee, president of Benoit Pelletier, has an important position in Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude great meetings, "not necessarily summit", but a moment when "the common vision will be applied".
The North development should finally continue in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "commonly designed, structured and protected to life," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visual" as a gas on the vision of liberal Prime Ministers who preached to him.
"We have changed our thinking as liberals, and have changed the challenges in a new opportunity for growth and development."
This was finally one of the remaining overlooked weekend subjects, which was started on Friday by a big cocktail that exalted the 50th annual approach of Jean Lesage to the head of the side.
One of the accepted resolutions aims to baptize Beauharnois' center on Adelard-Godbout's overground.
"From Godbout, which founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who carried out the Clean Revolution and the Population of Water Electricity, until after Bourass, who created James' battery, our sides were able to create the future," Jean Charest said.
On the printing, he called to another authority this time to conservate, and despite the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbakera, Prime Minister in 1957 to 1963.
When a row came to Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm going to plan to be with it," he claimed his member basically, which has caused a significant deceit.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that in 2008 elections and, of course, in 2009, did not allow elections on the basis of the annual year, which allowed him to be enabled by the law.
However, he highlighted that his program was bought, especially missioned by the Federal Council in China and the summit Quebec-New York.
The weekend sheet offered the leader of the liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, particularly certain "speed to change the constitution", which requested very cold: PLQ (Quebeka Liberal Page) requires particular recognition of the "Quebec specificity" in the Stage.
He also wants Quebec to appoint a part of the Canadian Council members for voting and television sentences which would have the right to be held in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposite side, the North Plan was to accept skeptics in its main drawings.
Boss PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois re-developed the development of North Quebec, which the country's government sent down in 2001.
It states that, when the government of liberals received power in 2003, the completion of this policy was determined.
If she kept, "they were still" Marois noted her candidate at Jean-Talon (which elections are running today) Françoise Mercures.
ADQ said that it would support the adoption of North Plan in the government.
"But we assume that it is not just a distraction," explained Sebastien Proulx, the leader of the representative of Maria Dumont, who is going back today from the empty.
Letters - Disappointed countries
It was Vic Toews, the "justice" ex-minister (o ironic) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour's last year that represented the "hanbu" for Canada.
This is how a woman who has led an unexpected fight for justice and who is deserving all our wonders, tells many about the primary environment as well as Stephen Harper's alone.
We have a government before us that, as the only one of all western countries, has not brought back to the authority of his State member closed in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
The government that doesn't assume that at the time of playing the acts he had been performed, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government who, despite the signature of Canada to the Geneva Convention, closes his word and leaves it to be moved in the Neidish submissions of the child’s soldier.
The only one that is based on the parodium of justice to test the wine of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and in particular the Canadian Lawyers' Association, calls for Omar Khadra's repatriation in order to wait for a justice process in Canada.
The government also closes the eyes before the torture: it is little important that this young man is recently psychologically destroyed, and it certainly endured, after so many years of trial.
We don't realize that, but we're just witnesses of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper's so depressed and that from his mouth sounds so empty.
There was a time when there is no more morality: it is possible to punish a Canadian citizen, injury him wrongly, capture him according to the library of the Chief afterwards of the Minor Government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many electors will find a salvation from the side that reports the Honor, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has denied what has made the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Hanba is, Mr. Tawsi, in this statement, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellov discourse of Barrick Gold
In the issue of September 17, Le Devoir printed the letter of Patrick J. Garver, the Executive Vice-President of the Canadian County of Barrick Gold.
With orwellow logic, it confirms that the biggest producer of gold in the world has started triggering three authors and a poor poor small shipment for honoring, with a view to a "transparent public debat" and requires six million of them.
If the judges are independent and independent, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of the wrath of honour, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver's going to break this principle solution completely.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate, to bring anybody to a little bit, who would be able to take up the opposite position?
In any case, the authors and issuers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to lose respectful sums to be prepared to go up and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported almost by the unseen caps.
Tactics in these non-equalified struggles are finally often in the destruction of the accused ones to pursue peaceful procedures, which will stumble the mouth in the opposite side, and also fear anyone who would deceive this matter.
If Barrick Gold wanted a public debate, she had its view of the whole thing to present public opinion.
In contrast with what's happening in some countries in which Barrick Gold acts, in Canada, the debate in normal circumstances in exchange of thoughts, and not in the wounds of dealing.
Therefore, the interim company was lacked before opening its books, documentation and setting up a debate through news, media, publications and financing of independent teams that could lead light into all things.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinions and rejects the five and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he could ask "public debate" and also repeat the views of the public?
It seems that this word in the vice-president world is only a deeply payable lawyer, not all the Canadians; it is a pretty fair understanding of this concept.
The democracy has the right to guard the natives.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is making it primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the rental company.
The public is ready to hear and review, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, not on the basis of what many consider as a trip in which the complaints of the mouth (in the course of their "public debates", Barrick just gave the official calls to the authors of Noir Canada to inform them officially that the property is to stop using this term...).
If we mention the surreal Garver's statement, the initiation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on universal freedom of request and seeking the truth which are essential for each democracy society.
In general, it supports the right to cite confidential resources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that represent the basis of intellectual activity.
If in the country, like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that don't like the rich companies of this world, without repeated trip, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was able to handle the standards used by Noir Canada authors.
He has the right to answer.
The universities we belong to are able to run debates and inconveniences and to resolve conflicts.
The transferred complaint of Barrick Gold shows that, despite what it claims, it does not have a minimum pleasure to conduct a transparent debate.
For the University World, it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time to take the governments measures that would restrict such an injustice.
Wall Street Saving Operations - Democrats and Republicians understand
Bush administration and transfers to Congress, both the Republicans and the Democracy, finally yesterday have reached a agreement on the greatest safe economic plan from the great crisis of 30 years.
The new version of the plan, as a means of 700 billion dollars to raise the financial crisis that has already been cloumed by Wall Street for months, must be approved by both Congress rooms.
In particular, it assumes: better control of the selected representatives over its disorder, new mechanisms to ensure payment of public money stored, new measures to capture the amounts of houses entered for non-payment and also the right to follow the amounts payed by the leading workers saved by fire.
The American Ministry of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Snembal representatives of Nancy Pelosi and representative of the Republicans at the Action Board, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached the agreement that will be on the market," said Bush's representative, Henry Paulson.
"All was done so that real economy and running Americans were safe before the crisis just running on Wall Street," he explained the democratic.
"This is the primary point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos and the infringement of the Americans' daily life will be great," said republican Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, the negotiation was spread to maximum turnovers from fear of the effect, which would be a further failure to distribute investors.
The time limit was the opening of markets today.
Both candidates at the US President were invited to negotiate and both were more for the agreement, but they did not not remind to express their disappointment in the need for such a national solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has approved the completion of the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which it is to enable the residents to maintain their livelihood, and measures on the salary of the workshops saved by fire.
"When we ask payers to take special measures for the incompatibleness of some people, it is not what to congratulate you.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television wheels.
His Republican supporter John McCain, who was questioned by another station, would vote for the plan, answered, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The worms I've read, [shows] that it's something we'll all have to do and that we can continue.
Choose inactivity is quickly inacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion plan is to purchase for the money of payers of suspicious payments and risk and unselling assets of American financial institutions.
The plan is coming after 14 months of the crisis that has been discharged by the market of unnecessary bubbles, which first led to the deterioration of risk-hypotetic credits (subprimes), then transferred to further, expanded forms of credit (PCAAA) and was deployed in the conjunction of finance and in the distribution of banks and financial institutions.
The first conclusion of the agreement from the last week to the consciousness of the Republican lawyers.
Since the democracy has reached that for some "toxic" assets of the companies who have difficulties the government will only be handed, but they will not recompense them, it will be convinced that the freedom of life is blessed.
In trying to draw close to the contradictive opinions in Congress, measures were attached to establish that the Government will be able to introduce new taxes that will help them to recover their contribution if the programme would have to collect losses for five years in the result of the programme.
The new plan will calculate the first amount of 250 billion, which will be added to another 100 billion, if the President considers it necessary.
The additional 350 billion should approve the Congress in a new vote.
With his help, Washington will receive shares in saved companies that will pay dividends in the case of his profit and that will be able to sell again when it's all.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to late the procedures for the insolvency of loans related to the plan, as to determine the limits for the evaluation and the damage paid to the leading workers achieved by fire.
The Officers of the Plan would have voted in the Sneavy representatives already today and in the Senate in the center.
Despite all the effort made, they are not still sure that their plan will have a green plan.
Yesterday, the votes in both the Republican and the Democratic camp continued to be informed against this project.
"It's obvious that Washington doesn't hear you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the financial committee of Snémvny, at the address of the electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there's a solution.
However, it is not a solution to payment."
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of the group of congressmen, "the Committee of Scepticians", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred weighted economy professors, including three Nobel's prices, wrote: we ask Congress to fail to get too rapid and carefully examine the way to release," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe reaffirmed that this crisis is a world crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, three countries reported to Benelux the part of the bank’s group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USDs).
The intervention of the Government, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank, BNP Paris, reported that it declined from the purchasing of its competitors who are on the basis of the deterioration since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USDs) as a result of the risk credit crisis for the purchase of immobility in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, including twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"We won't come about these money," said the Dutch Ministry of Finance Wo ه Bos yesterday.
"We're getting optional rights on payment and influence.
And this is just what the relatives and households today can evaluate."
On the other hand, the channel La Manche seems to be started by the British Government of the nationality of other banks achieved by financial crisis.
According to English pressure, the government had to take all existing banks Bradford and Bringley credits, from which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USDs) had made credits to buy inability.
According to his yesterday announcement, the Spanish Bank Santander will buy the rents and accounts of the British Bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British Government has to renew from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Communityly implied icons
His beauty with azur eyes represented his furf, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American hero miss with an amazing smile of narcissism?
Yes and not.
Emotion, emotionality, and unexpected talents, which were his own, also departed from the power category that produces real stars.
But how was it running on a trace!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years on his ranch in Connecticut in the carcinoma cancer and remains one of the last American cinematography icons.
Less big than Brando, who was like and was somewhat his rival on the film plane, Newman was a more careful hero, a closer crying, but also the apostle of freedom and divorce of dramatic conventions.
Blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was born.
Without an overwhelming ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it the whole country was seen in love for himself made man, a battle in a war in a hurtful battle in the early 50 years, who studied heritage in Yale, then visited the Newyor Actor's and celebrated triumph in the divadle, in the television and in the movie.
The same man who was fighting for civil rights was also a car driver who was located as a second on the 24-hour train in Le Mans in 1979, and rather than a sexual symbol, even since 1958, he made a model couple with the heric Joanne Woodward.
With him, it also declines the nice places of this, discrete, socially engaged stars, allergic to the contact of the own show business, which will always remain in a certain degree of mysteries.
A genuine man, in the most excited words of sense.
The department of Paul Newman this week has caused a return to the lovers of the movie, while his great role is along with the black plague.
After it, he defilates more than half a century continually changing American seventh art.
In memory, the charmant cowbow from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Kotche to the broke, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient past (1990) we have saved his sensible Mr Bri, deceived in a progressive marriage, which did not satisfy all expectations.
So many other Pauls Newmans went into the inside.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, thrown, violent, unforgettable delict from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In a sign of hatred) Robert Wise, a role appointed for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman introduced in real knowledge in 1956.
Sympathic gangster in the great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The wormful and conscious puzzle player in the spectacular The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same position in the Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him in 1987 of the only Oscar with seven nominations.
This face of a traveling, it was him.
And he again.
In his professional travel together, it supports different times.
Young people know it primarily thanks to Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlopa, an untraditional hoke trainer.
The fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers of Coen.
After his career, he closed the role of the Irish mafia farmer in Road to the Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003.
For a number of movie legends that were relatively soon left the movies, Newman remained in a lifetime, perhaps he condemned Hollywood with his payments, advertisements and procedures.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, never without humor, considered him "for a living call underplaying", judged that he pressed too much on a drink in his performance.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose role was in the submissions, the professes were not so nice.
However, the lovers played less often than the outsides: neurotics, alcoholics, lumpys and disfellowships, whose falls and rebellion were reflected in his perfect drawings.
As register Newman, he discovered a little famous page of his sensitivity.
His movie Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (see Canadian Roman Margaret Laurences), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, gives a sensitive woman's portrait full of melancholia.
For his son Scott, whom he lost for overdosing, he was in 1984 filming Harry and Son, full of study and disturbance.
In the case of the pockets that Newman had received yesterday, his big friend and former companion Robert Redford (smoking together in the Sting and in the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) he urged: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Majesty, love for life, such are the main characteristics of the dead heart.
If we mention his legendary career, there is also a big battle for civil rights, environment, independent movie, Hollywood attack.
His illustration was usually used to see on the wine octa, the cocktail, the dry and other foods, which could have seen us quite unexpected, although it was at the beginning about gag.
However, the profits of the sales came to the account of his Sending for Hard Children.
The Newman's way, rather than he'd let her glorify, he was engaged in the company at the last time.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following: "Always and until the end your father was thankful to his happy planet.
It was my honour that I could be here."
And for us it was the honour of wearing the way to follow the life of a so cruel and big American artist.
And besides, the end of the end, the model citizen.
What happened in the manufacture on the Zuslag & sex factures?
On 8 October, he shall take account of the penalty against Janosi Zuschlag and his companions.
They and its partners are other criminal acts, including the broadcasting of the papers, accused of the undercutting period and systematic criminal organizations, which have caused extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecution, the money obtained in public competitions to their own own employees and to carry out tasks were often made by ficticial factures.
Finance from State and self-recurrence - about 65 million forints - traveled in part to the Fiatal Baloldal postal organization, in part to the cabs of individuals.
The way that the investigative authority also informed was that the money obtained in public concurrence was chosen on the basis of the facts for which it had not been anti-evaluated and that the commitments of the company had never been reached.
According to the complaint, large part of the facture was false.
The prints for these factures were buried from the yessefvoiros market, the cooled race was made in Kiskunhalas.
In particular, the production of factures has been decided on the surrounding road at the north side of Balaton, which was sent by István Ladose Yanos Zuschlag.
According to his responsibility, he had first been appointed to view the pens and restaurants.
In them he requested for its consumption, according to which, according to the model, the factures presented in the public competitions expressed outside the Youth and Sport Ministers, the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs, respectively the Main town's Samoa.
There was a building of the István Lados with his partner Andras, who, according to our information, most often wrote the news necessary to obtain the subvention.
Lados looked at one beer on his "studial road.
According to two facts issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this hosting equipment for the nineteenth group of the Biztos Pont class ensured.
However, as the leader company claimed, so many people would not have to go to this equipment suddenly.
Similarly, the factural and containing errors of the facture expressed in 2002 by Jobb Jövért, after Egypte and Harmadik Evezredt.
The Pen in Badacsonatomy had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep one night in it, yet there were hundred thirty guests on the fact.
However, printers with a wealthy fantasy, even when they introduced documents on the same hosting company - Pigal s. r. o., in its ethnicity in accordance with information provided by the State representatives, documents on the name of Jobb Jöv́ertt and Hoppa have not yet figured.
The Gy\z Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when he was called to the prosecutor and showed him the factures, he immediately said that it was about false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax numbers were on the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formality, it did not agree that, according to the factures, hundreds of people have only 11 rooms that have not so large capacity.
Moreover, the facture also indicated food, while their restaurants are not working for a long time.
The fierce producers of the facture did not even confess that the viewed Budapest road was organized by the officer only on the roadways, and on the facturation of payment in preparation, which was also not agreed with the facturing practice of the company, they introduced the poster as a service for the deployment of the road to Hungary.
Moreover, as in the course of the investigation, they also introduced the DPH in the document, perhaps the organisation of travel to the country outside the European Union was reduced by the DPH.
On the four documents expressed by Jobb Jövért company of Hotel Révülöp s. o., it did not agree otherwise or above DPH. For the company’s activity, it was not a 25%, but a 15% of DPH, but the employees of the hotel just printed factures, but the facture was written with the hand.
In addition, "senders" reported the facture by indicating in one company how the state representative's investigation has shown the effect of the operation of the road transport of goods that the company based on investment advice did not carry out.
The factures issued by Együtt and Harmadik Evezredt and the communities XXI. Shazadi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont were false, and they were also exploded because of formal derogations - not corresponding to the format of the facture and the wrong race.
Similarly, as in the case of Ravenna, or the Sport camp in Kunfeherto, whose representatives claimed that they would express the factures.
For example, the participants did not not notice that HIB was from Niiregyhaza at the time (2001), when a group of Fiatal Városert groups had been spent in liquidation, therefore, according to our information, the liquidation Commissioner of the company also emphasized that he would deliver the paper.
The building of the houses
The second group of facturers is those who believed that they had to expose a fiktival facture.
Asély Budapestert's advice exposed approximately four million forints for Harmadik Evezredt for the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization - Efjú Szocialistak.
The Chairman Collab s. o. adopted, according to the claim to issue fiktivity, one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
With Zuschlag and its partners, Biogate s. r. o, currently in the liquidation, which in 2003 resourced Jobb Jövért and the associations of Atlash and Preösfeny by factures in the value of about five million forints, which were not undertaken by economic activities.
Don't move money because the factures created were post-based, which, however, have forgotten to introduce in their documents.
The next group of facturing fires belongs to those who had commitments to complaints.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the representative of the Ukrainian acting company Delta Trió s.o.o., who was dealing with the trade in fuel weights and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, where however, the company is not to be found.
In October, November 2005, the company exposed just a few factures for the sale of ́s ́s calculative technology in a value of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, the Cash Investment company purchased these factures from 14 September 2005 in the liquidation.
The member of this company was a man from Romania who had to submit the papers relating to the company as well as Iván Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, in the course of the investigation, Kubatov admitted that, on behalf of the company, he issued the factures to the peoples of Atlas, Hoppa and Egypt and Harmadik Evezredt and accepted their anti-evaluation.
On request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, none of the fires worked, according to the accused, because they missed work.
Nevertheless, the businesses were for his benefit, because on request of the jointly committed lawyer Zsolta Sente, who also prepared their baselines, has made the factures to the peoples of Atlas and Y-generation connected to Zuschlag.
The name of the Firem Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade has given Kubat's organizations a total of 15 factors of 14,2 million forints.
The State Representative claimed that Kubatov had reached 10 per cent of the amounts listed on factures and PDPs.
In order to establish fiktival factures, this time for the selection procedure for the community of Biztos Pont, the man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
The groups Y-Generation and Šövetség and Modern Magyaroršágérth have contributed to the public competition of Mihálye Ta ́sics (TMA), publicly successful socialist party organization.
They were obtained after 500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not charged for the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order to do so, the TMA presented five ficticial factures from the Works Team s. o.
These factures were finally found at the home of a spectacle in the Office of Arr ́da Kemecsei at the Ministry of School.
During the calculation of the parts of the complaints, it probably describes the progress of the production of the factures as it already acted on the prosecutor.
It may be more interesting if everything is decided to discover the primary accused Janos Zuschlag himself.
His basic statement is not too detailed, and even though he has promised that everything would be exhibited, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - a exchange for a large part of damage, fifty million forints, perhaps socialists have concluded an agreement with him, and Usi will take it to himself.
He could eventually be disappointed, because his requests for a mixture of his detention, namely the location in the home process, remained unhearted.
While economic penalties pagans who have suffered much more damage that they have not yet replaced, they can be free or at least waiting for the end of the execution against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology: Why do we lose more money?
At the carriers, customers are willing to lose more money, to appreciate goods.
Neurological and economic bases of this known - and probably irrational - have been able to discover researchers from the neurology and the economy of the New York University.
According to their study, published in the magazine Science, people do not want to stop the type of eBay, so rai will pay too high price.
The contact with the experimental attempt to map the scheme of this "play" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers has seated, the second group has reached the border, using the method of the magnetic rezonance (fMRI) tested by the active brain of testers.
In both games, the players could win money, but when playing on a game, with the important element to cross the other side, he started to work intensely under the brain coat, called striatum.
This brain plays more than many other roles in the "self-resolving" mechanism of the nervous system.
The estimation of the price is, therefore, possible, according to researchers, to explain the attempts to avoid the reaction of the group.
In order to support their theory, Members of the research team conducted a financial survey of the economy.
In the case of it, three groups were invited against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product concerned, and they acted in charges.
In addition, the following group members were promised that if they get out of the game victory, they will receive more $15.
The third group has received 15 dollars before the charge, but in the case of loss, her members and those money have come.
Thus, the division between the two groups estimated all overall in highlighting the winning and the other loss.
However, members of the group playing "contrasts" were willing to go higher than it was in a control and "victorious" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"This outcome cannot result from any existing economic theory before.
The same has yet been explained by evidence notable in the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
When neurological educational methods helped us to resolve the opposite between these two theories so that we have now grown up to the third explanation," Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you search for your doctor?
About half billion people worldwide suffer chronic hepatitis B or C infection, then in Hungary this chronic hepatic disease is indicated between the main causes of death.
The start of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to hundred thousands, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name of hepatitis is a comprehensive name of hepatitis infections caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, a significant hepatic and jail, but the pains of disease and their caused diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are width in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E with treating equipment (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood vires and physical liquids (sperm, posts, secrets, slides).
In any case, travellers should be protected by expectation against virus A and B, against vaccine type C.
Hepatitis A symptoms are shown two-three weeks after the use of a infected food, usually injuries, weaknesses, breast pressure, remission.
Then the skin and the eye whites are created by a jaw, a light chair and a dark power. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people will die throughout the world for more serious types of this disease, hepatic cancer and hepatitis B.
Claim is that, according to estimates, only every tenth disorders are treated medicationally.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to liver cirhosis or liver cancer.
The majority of the insults of their illness doesn't know, the powder of the disease ruins the hepatic cells in general, and thus the first symptoms will be produced in many cases until 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important that a temporary prevention, conducting a regular description.
In three groups, this disease is much more frequent than in the meantime: among people who have sold blood transfusion, drugs and tattoo people before 1991.
Currently, the worldwide number of individuals who are infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million are estimated.
Since the disease can demonstrate an already-routine investigation, a person should turn to his practical doctor in case he refers to any symptom of an unknown pıa.
When discovered, the disease is treated, virus can be removed from the body, and prevented the insufficiency and prevention of cancer.
September 30, hepatitis was the world’s day, which was organized by the first worldwide representatives of disease organizations in 2004.
His goal is to warn the chronic hepatic hepatitis caused by these viruses, the causes of his appearance and the importance of temporarily recognition of disease.
Who doesn't do God, that's so bad?
According to recent research results, faith in God works as an analgetic that could facilitate death to catholics.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examined how the human faith affects the God of the impression of pain, the British Journal Telegraph.
In a lot of bizarre investigation, 12 catholics and the same number of atheists were made with electric shocks, while all observed the malb showing Mrs. Maria.
According to the results, Catholics were capable of expeling a large part of the pain.
As a result of technology, the human brain also showed that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of the question series that are accompanied by academics, philosophers and theologists from different parts of the University.
The test was completely tested so that the test was attached to the left hand of the test entity to the iron tool that issued electrical shocks.
Students requested attempts to closely observe two males: Sassoferrat Lady Marii, sepulching from the 17th century and Dama with food da Vinci, designed in the 15th century.
The research authors hoped that the view of Mrs. Marii would cause a certain state of devotion, while they chose Vinci's image because they were not too different from the first time and acted according to them with a calm view.
The entities spent half a hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received in four of the following parts of 20 electrical shocks, while they separately followed the image with religious or generally these.
The Catholics claimed that when they looked at Mrs. Marie, they felt "in safe" as if they were "played" and "speaked, he filled them with peace."
When they followed the image with religion, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had a work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in research, believes that a similar ingredient can be achieved by means of any strongly effective image and in the athletes, only a correct photo needed.
"They have to find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of the mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Italian bishop Tom Wright welcomed research results.
"The practicality of faith should change and in many cases will also change our personality," added Wright.
After such excellent outcomes, there is only a question of what the painful regulation should be if they show them a certain madon from a specifying calibre.
Would he mean the quality view of Mrs. Marie to achieve even better results?
You're the one you're going to share with yourself.
Of their tenth birthdays, Google can announce that people can put it in their caps at least as well as in heaven's head; they know where they were allowed, to which professional investigation and what they are interested.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the boss of the company, but it's still missing.
Of course, regarding skeptics that make a paralel with a dark orwellow vision, these are not just the same base of the 2.0 web.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed for the Financial Times journal that the main googlu target is to store more personal data for the Google founders to be able to carry out their p's purpose, which said: "Let us prepare all the information in the world!"
According to the relevant representative of Googlu, the company also stands in the worldwide work after ten years just on the beginning to work with all information.
The question, which will be in five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer the questions of the type "What to do tomorrow?" or "What work would really be done for me?" - on such a simple question, however, the software will be able to answer until they have enough information about the recipients.
Not all Internet participants are well aware that during the Internet search, the searching words are exactly captured from which IP addresses were searched and on which pages the interesters were moved after searching.
Thanks to the Service Personalized Search started two years ago, they can keep their surfing history, they can look back to what they searched and clicked, then generating findings adjusted much more directly to them - on the same logic, the Recommendations service will also be recorded by the system based on previously listed and stored preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data will be used against me, and when someone looks at what I'm doing? - They ask those who look at the Googlu data monopol fear.
In most cases, the potential power that is represented by the company is more dangerous, the reaction does not call on in the Internet holders of the guilty, the fear of the offense, the desire of freedom or even the rebellion against power.
In addition, it is confirmed that not only all searched expressions are captured, but in declined cases, the third party may also be issued, in such legal cases, of the person's personal rights to the Internet.
The most famous example of the last time was likely coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles during which Google provided information to the Brazilian Government that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the community of Orkut, which were created by its ownness.
However, the Internet's careers of personal rights could still breathe in May when the company with the EFF's EFF's organization has successfully proved his truth in connection with the FBI: Google must not be required to provide any information for the secretly requested FBI in the future.
(In the same time, the Federal Government has successfully evacuated fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searched expressions received by revocation to strengthening the child protection law before the year adopted, however, it has not been able to obtain lists of individual items, respectively the full lists of web pages and key words that include two months.)
The view of Google is so disappointed: it is worth those who are both of providing their personal data because they feel that their intimate sfers and their private life will continue to use Googlu services, exposed to the prison, and they arise against him with the revolt that belongs to the overnational companies with conservation images.
And then the American geek of culture and its divorced footnote, gathering around herself computer fans, activists and actors, which appear in many countries, sees a new generation of greatkofire, "corporation which now breaks", in turn from his Microsoft rival, which is considered to be the winners of the world, as they both fight for the same purposes.
This can be caused by the fact that Google doesn't require from his holders the identification code and doesn't want money for its own; opened, free and uncontinued clean source of information and program packages act as much more available, younger, "cooler" than the practice of the official software work.
However, it can also be caused by the geek’s accurate understanding of a very difficult relationship with the Internet and personal rights, which just brought to themselves one of the most closest key words of the last years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing other than cooperation, that we are promptly keeping tracks behind ourselves and using the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is in each other, the foundation remains the same: we show ourselves.
A meaningful young person can lead a profile immediately to a number of community pages from Facebook after Xang, which can be quietly connected to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which refers to listened music, then all of it can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, otherwise, it can write a blog on which it will automatically discover his newest photo gallery, which is recorded on Flickru or Picase.
On the other hand, we can learn about a lot of examples of cases from which it explains: a friendly girl when looking at the photographs of common friends, it will easily come to the one with whom her lonely friend was spent tonight, or the company can exhaust his work only because he is in his blog, and it is clear that the concept of his private life has been completely overcome today.
The person who lives online is consisting of what he shows from himself, so they could define the basic tess that hides after the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to beat something or at least avoid googlov monopol, has the possibility (begins Scrooglem, which uses the Googlu searching system, but does not care about the tracks).
For example, a few people are not approved to register on community pages so that they are unable to be available. Online Googlu from the text editor after photo editor and the reporting portal is possible to change to alternative versions that are not connected to the open server parks and which of us will not set the most quality possible profile.
Public opinions are not too secretly expected when Google will show the darkness.
The company has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense insect areas threaten the investment of advertising agencies and services continued to deploy the life not only to Microsoft but also to the additional software designers.
The critical observators, however, also stress the contraceptive points of disappointment: for example, the top lead has completely refused the protests of employees after double taxation for the fire school, freely often the daily feeding of employees was too costful according to the management of the company, however, all of the losses at the fact that Google was still declining from the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the meaning of their agreements, the finding that causes a good effort, respectively to the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that it never pre-includes new services, just when it is already possible to be used, but it is certain that expectable problems in the following months and years can prevent the world in new places: while some believe that Googlu project is related to scanning and archiving books and magazines, that the company will soon have regarding the US Supreme Court, other fears of its health system, we can also set up a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
♪ that Google is building a genetic database, then it can serve as a good standard material and for the following generation of sci-fi writers, the glorious news of Cory's Doctor "Scroogled" describes the future with orwellow reminders, in which it can be able to draw close to a person with fearful fear only using data from Googlu.
Two-fold killers from Ozda helped to remove two youths' feet
Two youths listened to the police in the case of double murder in Ozda, according to a suspicious suspicion, helped to remove the stage of this crime, he said on Wednesday the High Police Directorship of Bursod.

The Varsovian storm acted for the purchasing of praises
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered a warshaw valuable papers for buying a stepcent package of the action of the Prague Action Borg.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Varsovian bills of valuable papers, confirmed the proposal by the Poland party, despite the fact that the Czech Warshaw Burse from the branch of the potential new owners of the Prague bourgeoes had already been released before.
D's the fact that the owner of the Warsaw bourgeois is a statement.
99 per cent of the action is in the hand of the Polish State who wants 60 percent of the price papers to sell for several months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the proposal of Poland represents the highest amount offered by the interesters in the Prague Burse.
According to the Czech letters, there has yet been offers of the vicious bourgeois of valuable papers, the transatlantic action bourgeois Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London bourgeois and Deutsche Börs.
The leader of the Prague Action Bridge Peter Koblic stated last week that the Varsovian bourgeois of valuable papers would be the worst owner of all interesters, and he did not claim that it could lead to the construction of the Prague Action Borg in the future.
The value of the Prague bubbles of value papers is estimated by experts on a share market of 5-10 billion.
According to the agreement of shareholders, approximately 90 per cent of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Action Bird is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by the Czech Republic of 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a. with 13,5 percent.
Financial crisis in view of European papers
In their Tuesday comments, international financial crisis has already been held by the previous European letters "on September 11th".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the President of the United States, providing an accusation of the Roman La Republic. The president did not even be able to broke his own side to support the payable law, whose goal is to repair this failure...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, who was a billioner and investor Warren Buffett, could talk about the second 11 September.
The part of the Madrid pressure also sees a winner in Washington.
According to the journal El Mundo, the world economy has brought to the place of the darkness of political leadership.
The risk of the harvesting of the American financial system continues to grow, which will finally pay the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after voting in Congress, it is dangerous that Washington does not offer a political crisis solution.
The world economies are in the air - just in the moment when one of the largest changes in capitalism is running.
The threat can't be remembered anymore, shows the female days-Anzeiger journal.
The individual states may still be able to provide for the funding institutions of a salvation circle and tax payers can save them from the crack.
Yet, if the domain's cooks is still more banks, they're going to be enough for money or other improvisations.
In the perspective, Member States of the European Union must be transferred through their national egoism and simplify the control of distorted financial markets.
Only on Monday, there were more than 100 billion euros in the vineyard Der Standard, which is concerned that like the Americans will have to be deeply more real in the crisis solution as well as the European tax payers.
The European Union is a crisis that has not yet been seriously concerned as a conami.
"Saverers" don't need to have a stamiliar euro right now, but it would be good if they were firmly determined in which case it is reasonable to deal with the money of tax chargers in order to prevent more damage.
Intelligent car imitates a whistle flying
What would like to be the best method of developing the potential to prevent the swimming, unless the imitation of detectors of obstacles in the world of nature?
For example at the evening.
The strategic idea of a surprising project represented on the Japanese CEATEC chairman, was introduced to the ingeniers from Nissan's company's shot. It was how to set up a new generation of systems that prohibited the snacks.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the biomimetical robotic system of the BR23C management, robotized miniauto, equipped with the properties of the clef, with the final objective of helping the creation of a system, which can eliminate all the snaps.
"Every night, it creates its own personal space of the ovarian facility, which actually likes our security protection packaging," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the General Manager of labels for the PR and research and development.
They play a important role of slow eye, which allows you to see in all directions in a sample angle more than 300 degrees.
The engineers looked at the idea of the laser distant distance.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of 2 metres before BR23C in the 180 degrees of the sample field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the palub microprocessor, which immediately changes in a operation that is proportionate to the defense of the swimming.
The interruption is arrested during a second break, then the robotized car starts to imitate the moves of the wheel and rotation of the rounds that are necessary to prevent the wheel immediately changes the direction.
In a range of any existing system, this extinctional manager runs in a completely instinct way.
"If it wasn't so, the robotic car could not respond enough to dismiss obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, leader Laboratory mobility and robot car project.
It must respond instinctly and immediately, because this is the most vulnerable and internal level of safety pack, within which the snake is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the wedge does to avoid the other wednesdays.
This process can't take longer than the eye's darkness.
However, at the end of the end, this movement can not pass up, down or outwardly, only two-dimensional and only in the direction to which the road can be rounded.
Instead of unfailing options offered to the wheels, only in the case of a robotic car was applied to the possibility of turning, disturbing and slowness.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer battery which are easier and have higher energy humidity, which means that it has longer life than lithium-iont variants.
According to Andoa, an important instinct, intellectual reaction is not the ability to process, but less then to store data.
This mechanism must be processed and responsible only to several incoming signals for a second.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitis and logic based on data from previous maniers, thus it continues to use only a memory of a few kilobytes of size.
You don't remember with giga or megabyte capacity.
It is the first step to develop the use of immediate avoidance which, according to Nissana's review, could be reached in cars produced in the course of ten years.
Another option of application may represent the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead to the engineer to the end of the specified purpose after exit.
Damn kid has a name.
The law on the package for the safeguard of the economy of $700 billion, which is to be divided into a number of payments and which is the purpose of the redemption of non-quality bank credits, has already a written illustration.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After other negotiations that ended up to Saturday after the north-East Time of America, the representatives of the Congress reached the agreement within a few days of a debat on a safe packaging at a total of $700 billion.
"We have achieved a significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the Sneemonic representatives, which has only remained in writing the agreement.
Both President candidates Barack Obama and John McCain were also supported on the package.
The Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be strict, but it must take further steps."
The written pattern of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday 8 hours of Washington's night (and in two hours of Mediterranean Europe), but no special approach to the villages had been affected.
About us, the legal standards which hear the name of the Law on the Negotiary Economic Stabilisation of 2008, which the programme is to be established, will vote first on Monday, then a series of representatives on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosy on Saturday evening, after the agreements were also welcomed in the White House.
"The progress that has been achieved at night, we are peaceable and appreciate both sides' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," declared the speaker of the White House of Tony Fratto.
The programme is finally different from Bush's administration, which should be made to recover non-quality valuable papers guaranteed by hypothetics once a total of $700 billion.
Now it is possible to lose the first half of the 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matters expected on Monday decision of the Congress, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them valuable papers guaranteed by hypothetics, evaluated as an unqualified, and the decree remains of 100 billion dollars and will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special assembly, which will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of the Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can, in the meaning of the law, apply combined tactics: it can at the same time recover non-quality credits, hypoteques and valuable papers guaranteed by hypoteques, respectively other "unified" credits.
The redemption may be held directly and communicated to the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The norm will enable the companies concerned to participate in the assurance programme in which the Ministerial Finance will provide guarantees for anxiety representatives, which will then pay the price of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the need for the compliance with the minimum requirements of the US financial system to be charged up to $700 billion, whether it is already about a large purchase of bad stocks, their insurance or preventing the systemic risk associated with the destruction of some of the large money institutions.
"We will do the necessary steps, and they were ready to introduce the law immediately as soon as it is signed," added.
Boss banks, who have reached the trends and wait for the State's help, can count that the government decreases their distances -- which simply is called "good fall" in the sea slange.
In order to restrict their expenditure only in certain cases, these restrictions will also depend on the way of assisting the ministerial offices.
The restriction in principle means that if the Ministry purchases in the field, the tax payment will be eligible for the golden falls if the bank manager falls, they will be sent directly to the income.
In the case of direct redemption of non-quality loans, the Government will aggressively deal with the interest that money for the management is not overwhelmed.
It is necessary to add that existing proposals on gold falls are not changed, the restriction is only related to new contracts, which must be a further stimulating the programme.
"It is the first case in the American history when a legal restriction on the recompense of the Directors-General will be entry into force," commented the Chairman of the Committee for Financial Services of the Representatives, democracy Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State in banks shall have the right to get a share, which reduces the risk of tax chargers, since as soon as the economy and the saved bank will be put on their feet, they can also make it on this transaction.
The plan of advice includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress with a view to the way to which tax chargers are expected to return losses from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were votes expressing in relation to the plan of doubt.
"This is what the American citizens did not ask us, this is not the dollar of tax chargers," said the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democracy colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur judges that those who are responsible for Wall Street.

Barack Obama and McCain are for a back-up package
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of both the large American sides, on Sunday, reported their support of the government package for a bank salvation of $700 billion, but they are also politicians who require the Minister of Finance.
After the several-day marathon of the Congress and the administrative representatives, it was promptly reported on Sunday: the basic package agreement was closed to the bank salvation package.
The financial package, which aimed at moving the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, became the central question of the president's campaign.
Like Obama, so McCain is the most suitable of both candidates that would bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most fair investigations, while reaching the economic issues, Obama had a certain advantage again, and McCain's advice, which tried after the Republican Convention of Sarah Palin's nomination at the vice-president post.
Obama was born on a pre-optional meeting in Detroitu on the Sunday that the pack law would be 700 billion × to adopt the Congress.
He stressed that we include passengers relating to the protection of consumers that also support.

Overview of the printing of German languages
The right camp is uninterrupted, only electors inside have become more self-conscious - so it analyses the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavorska Der Spiegel.
Haiderovs are ready to rule Russia to protect the red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the Internet issue of the German reporting magazine, Franz Walter broke in his article "Bavorian revolution burns his father" because of the dramatic destruction of the CSU.
According to a known politologist, CSU's erosion started a long time before its office had taken a deep Beckstein-Huber duo.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavoria for decades - and now these modern citizens are just turning away from them.
Conciliation of the period is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, as well as Angely Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday, the process, which could be assumed of almost exactly ten years: the unproportional hegemonie of one country ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, CSU reached 47.7 per cent, first under 50 per cent.
This repeated three years ago at the elections in Bundestago in 2005, so so often during the period of Stoibber.
The cause is the modernization that the CSU has finally performed in this country and which will feed her parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but in time they have been very mistaken. Secularization, outcomes of education, seating Germans from east and north in the developing regions of Bavorska, however, could not be unconsequently affected by CSU electors.
Modernisation is linked to growing opportunities, which also has its visible political investigations.
The right camp is uninterrupted, only the electors inside have become more self-conscious, more critical, more self-conscious.
It is also evident that in the last weeks, the CSU has been the most of the classic civil layers; people in free call, animals, maturity units and high school education.
The CSU support has already fallen under 40 per cent.
The press (depresse.com)
Conserve the vicious journal with its article "Who, with whom? The presidents are in the issues of coality" means a mature intra-political income resulting from the raco elections.
SPUE wants to act with the EUFP.
The EUFP requires the mixture of SPUE in its internal matters.
BZÖ seems to be opened to all negotiations, green are still not wanted to go to the coal.
The choices are behind us, now everything runs around the coals; the presidents have not allowed them to look into their cards in the debate in public television.
The President SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to act with the EUVP.
And the SPUE wants to show that cooperation with both parties is certainly possible - in some social countries and in social partnership.
The question is whether to present the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the EUVP, as officer, left Faymann open.
As he was exposed, the course of Schüssel-Molterer was announced to every fall.
The repeat of this Directive shall not be taken into account.
Molterer responded to the red offers carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly be successful if Faymann is trying to mix into the Internal Affairs of the AEVP.
If his side chooses the opposition or enters the coal, it is still completely resolved, these questions should be determined within the EEA.
President BZÖ Jörg Haider returned to all directions.
"And they prohibited the red and black coal, we are ready to take the government's responsibility," said Haider.
Ironic: It is necessary to broke the inner circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Equality summary, which has been visited by France, the current president of the European Union.
Livia Jarók, lawyer of the European People's Party for Fidesh, as one of the main vocabularies of vocational training in its addressed full message, turned attention to the segregation in school because it is one of the most important injustices of Roman children, and also the most important obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Work and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
In order to arrange between invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of rights and civil associations of equal opportunities.
According to the print office of the Group of European posters, Fideš Yarók warned that, according to the discrimination that occurs in the setting of work forces, the Romans are extracted from the European market of work forces, mainly the wine of their low education.
"The majority of youths in Rome has no high school education, and because of the bad quality of basic education, only a part of them can achieve higher education."
Jaroko further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in applying other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children may mean the strengthening of the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the lawyer, it is necessary to confirm these relations in the widest cross - between the Roman and the Nero Children.
As far as the Roman student takes the school, the more opportunity will be to become a productive member of the market of work forces; the more needed tax will contribute to the national budget.
"Thes are the rights of their national citizenship in the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their unqualified and separate education," Livia Yarók said.
According to the lawyer, the coherence of the European Union with the view of the objectives and negotiations is necessary to achieve immediate delay of the school department processes, which is primarily important for the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination Regulations.
"It is necessary to broke the increasing circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide for the Roma children the opportunity of the democratic space to participate as a full-level citizen in the future of Europe," Jarok requested.
The "European Year of Equality" aims to the European Equality Summary Summary, organized annually from the Lonquin Meeting in Berlin, to ensure a single forum helping to achieve equality goals and to eliminate discrimination at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Mercy
The court of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the debat on personal issues, even though the high election debt has not yet been dealt with, the debate on civilian CSU has been rejected yet.
The President of Erwin Huber and the Territory Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their places, the question is how long this grace will take place.
On the condemnation of a tend, which has suffered a catastrophe of 17 per cent loss of votes, the last October weekend will decide the extraordinary congress of the party.
The members of the very criticized day have in any case let them hear that they will have all powers on their beds.
They have so calmed the disappointed members of the group and the bases that have requested the day after the "babor conami" of personal results.
Five years ago - true, yet under the lead of Edmund Stoiber standing on the top of the career - the Christian-social Union has obtained 60.7 per cent, now, a year after the shot against Stoiber, however, its forces were only 43.4 per cent.
CSU was a 18 percent of the German BDP "so-controller" in Bavoria throughout 46 years.
Even though the conservators in the southern country have key importance to Hungarian economics, high positions, but in the future, everyone will be worthy of coalition.
One of the first characters of the reorganization within the party is that a member of an enormous team which starts the audience negotiations on the eventual coalition of the Monochov government with the Liberal FDP, respectively with the right-oriented collection of the Free Elector, will also be the president and the Minister for Social Agriculture Horst Seehofer, which is considered as a potential Huber's representative.
It is ironic to condemn that Gabriel Pauli, whose exhibition against Stoiber, has been used to implement the duo Huber-Beckstein for the ambitional communal policy, has then made a very short process with ambitional communal policy.
The leaders of the CSU now concentrate all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, the active role is also to Stoiber, who has so far been supported by the background, an ex-president of the territory and some of the CSU president called on the last day of its political career on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber broke a number of appealing notes on the CDU address, according to which they would have been deserving much more support from the sister side.
Other CSU policies interpreted the fraud as a warning for the CDU and Angel Merkel.
After the elections in Bundestago in September 2009, Merkel may be able to be officer if the CSU, which played a significant role in the public success in 2005, does not put the common forces on the feet.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide its disappointment because of the physics, it would have lost the CSU position of negative impact on the Berlin big coal.
What is, of course, relative: treatment of the CSU vulnerablely and the crisis of social democracy continues.
The SPD has reached in Bavoria with 18,6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Luxury:opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections there was no opposition lawyer in the white-rush Parliament.
This can be explained according to Russian observators by the well-being and stability of the country held by Alexander Lukaše, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) by the illegalities to which the votes were counted.
OBSE, sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the choices.
Although the 110-member legislative assembly of 10-million countries has been opposed for ten years, the opposition associated with the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before the previous elections was seriously hoped that Lukašenka, which had left its changes in the settlement in the elections with the debatable course in 2006, and the fourth renewment of its presidential mandate, would be "consented" this time to show a number of oppositional commitments in Parliament.
The ODS left it from the previously considered boycot.
In the background of the opposition expected that in Russia, the economically dependent Belarus, which continued to deal with the consequences of the Russian imports of land, and also contributed to the establishment of Beltransgaz, the owner gases of the country in transition, in Russia, to improve the relations with the European Union, where, due to the white-evaluated political establishment as antidemocracy Luke and other political higher positions, the entry has not been sufficient.
The release was earlier indicated that the OBSE, in the evaluation of the preliminary campaign, focused on the position of the movement, and not on the lack - for example, on the prohibition of the candidate for a third opposition candidate.
However, the Monday OBSE's light report had an exception to the campaign, during which the opposition candidates were generally not able to discover in pressure, especially because the opposition could not be presented to the vote counting.
In addition, the opposition is possible to feel in the political system only improvement: political policies have been released to freedom and Minsk is willing to visit Moscow and to smaller conflicts when it continues to refuse to recognize the Georgia South Osetia and Abchasia, perhaps Russia, with whom Belarus is designed on the paper of the Union State, considers these two territory a monthly independent.
"We have made two steps forward and one of these, but the most important is that he started dialogue between Belarus and the EU," our letter Alexander Milinkević said.
According to the opposition candidate from the Presidency's elections in 2006, it is demanding that it remains, even though "the power has been recommended to leave the uncertain Parliament of the only member of opposition".
In view of the results of opposition, it does not plan protest action, rather he is trying to give the electors his message about the need for economic reforms.
"We, of course, have a lot of problems, the opposition lists must be printed in Russia, the distribution of obstacles of the local authority, but I see that the change supports much more people, even among the elders," Milinkević said with the indication that the Lukashenkov regime, which considers its greatest success to create social security, does not constitute the right or officially the most supported level of staff.
"For the debt of the country and the growth of trade deficit, it is only the question of the time when the social security 'inducing silence burbits' will be exhausted," judges Milinkević.
In turn, the Russian election observers were democracy.
The leading Community mission of independent states Sergei Lebedv, the Russian rapporteur agent Ria News, said that "the people don't believe in words, but in actions", so the abstention of opposition is nothing but the evidence of the growth of Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "From today's breakfast before work"
It's the first thing in the history of the Palace Chigi, which has been introduced by the turning doors at the coming and leave of the employees.
However, since today, this new action is still working against the anointed, against those who are strong, and then go to coffee at the time of work.
The news against the lens has been presented today to the Minister for Public Administration, Renatem Brunetta, and to the Secretary-General of the Council of Maur Masi.
"The turning door," says Brunetta – are a tool for better jobs, higher performance, more presentations and more services," explains the Minister.
"The new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
It's about reform," Brunett also highlights.
The Chigi Palace will finish the introduction in all the buildings of the presidential Council.
For Masi's "the choice of turning doors is also important in symbolic view".
There were no meetings from the employees; the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with the work and cooperation of all."
Shortly, no breakfast at worktime; no coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "It's nothing better than a good cappu at seven hours."
During one school at the University of Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister will finally notify that during three months, the disoccupation of public employees for sickness was decreased by 50%, which means more than 60 000 persons per year in work."
And adds that it is necessary that the Italian public administration becomes more effective
"her payment dynamic - explains the Minister - has doubled in the last 8 to 10 years as regards the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees were meeting to reject Brunett's decree standards in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
"When the Minister for Public Administration presents today the numbers relating to the lower absence in the case of illness – writes the Association for the Protection of Users – the nation of the "fill-breaks" is still growing.
In Italy, there are thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have saved themselves to announce the war of illegal standards in the decree."
In Tara, it will be protested primarily against the exposure of infections depending on activities; the enlargement of the period in which it is possible to verify the time limit of control visits and the final standards included in the new Ministerial establishments.
Works ́ rents, Napolitano: "Resolutional prevention"
Each day, in Italy there will be 2.500 employees, three persons will die and twenty-seven remain invalid.
The Inail values confirm that in 2007, we have approximately 00 death by the results of work income.
These values testify of the seriousness of a sign that remains one of the main elements of death and causes at least double death compared to murder.
To rebuild the attention of institutions, social and information on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th national day of the victims of employees set on the second Sunday in October.
"The inquiry date extended by Anmilo and the same travel reports of these days confirms the important issue of work security," confirms the President of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to the President Anmilu, the National Association for Fishing and invalidity for work, Peter Mercanda.
The head of the State expresses its live admiration for the continuous common effort to safety at workshops, to protect vulnerable works, to help families of victims and to participate in public opinions."
"Naturally a rebellious 'soft' has been raised, sincerely divided in the face of tragedies, which in its range causes disruption in the media and age of public opinion, but the daily ability offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamic."
Napolitano doesn't hide that " there is also a problem of resources here: it's decided to invest in education and information.
Special importance is to buy multiple initiatives in school so that young people who lead to the world of work can get a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to be warned of this nature, not to be seen due to its concernful social difficulties, to apply and improve the legislative standards.
The President of Gianfranco Fini, on its own side, stressed: "When the death of the results of the rate of work creates absolutely critical social status, as it hurts the conscience of everyone of us and forces all institutions to convince the effort of the necessary end of this status."
"Where the facts of work, it seems to be shown a certain position to turn, however, it does not imply that the dead end of the job of the cost is as alarmant," said President Anmilu Pietro Mercande.
"They didn't just want this "small of destruction" to lead to less attention, because just at the moment when the attention rises, the tragedy will explode.
"We believe that it is generally too little to stop the problem of the offences, and there are many activities that may affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, that Mercande's highlighted – to increase controls and inspections, but to be more involved in the training of workers, and soon from school."
"There is still needed another effort - added – as regards communicating and participating in public opinion.
But mostly it is necessary to make a sense of responsibility by employees to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social nature."
Finally, Mercande declared that it was the progress of degeneration of the right to damage proposed for the work of the victim and the "reduction of support care" to which the system has been obtained in recent years."
"The goal is, therefore, to return the assurance guarantee to the employee - added – because the judgment of those who are hurt should not depend on spontaneousness or payment of time from time to time by lawmaker."
Mp3 players are accused, exposing risk listeners
Listen to longer music and use transmissible musical devices as Mp3 players can cause persistent audience damage.
According to the today published notification of the European Commission, which, in one of the official reports extended in Brussels, refers to the amendments to the Committee on Health risks that recently developed and identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this deep view – reading in comments – shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music through transmissible musical devices for at least five years a week more than a hour a day and hold the device for high volumes risk a permanent loss of listening capacity."
"I'm worried that so many young people who are often using transmissible musical devices and mobile phones at high acustick levels can uncertainly hurt their ears in an inappropriate way," Meglen Kuneva admits.
"From deep detections, the leader continues to rise and is necessary to respond.
The most important is that we have to enhance the needy and publish the information.
We must continue to check already existing control systems in the light of this deck detection, so that they become completely different and keep a step with the new."
Brussels requested the independent Dependent Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of transmission musical devices and the increased number of young people exposed to the sound of this puzzle.
"Scients – concluded by the Executive Officer Eu – confirm that it is necessary to be concerned and the European Commission will now check together with the remaining members and parties who have raised the problem, which measures might be possible to be taken and so better protected by children and young people from making sounds that are transferred from musical instruments and similar equipment."
There is already a European security standard that limits the volume of transferring musical devices to 100 dB, but there is anxiety about the damage of the audience, which can be caused by overwhelmed exposure to sound-like forms.
It is possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions as a decreasing level and the duration of the exposure.
In their conviction, the Scientific Committee Eu states that the transmission of musical devices, if they use music ( more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum allowed sound at work.
Those who listen to music in such signs after a longer time risk the permanent loss of listening after five years.
This problem should be affected by 5-10% of such devices and their quantity can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
I say, Germany leaves the Commission free progress for the future of the main city
Today, in March, we'll close, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the employees "Commission for the Future of the Major City of Rome", which has meet today in its new seat behind Caracall's ladders.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 of the other members of the Commission will set hands for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the General Assessment Council of Analysis and Projects will be closed in order to present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official investigation" Campidoglia and his advisor Gianniho German.
"The Commission is fully independent and are included in all political, social and cultural ideas – he wants to highlight Germany – It will have to ensure our development of Rome, which will finally use the political decisions remaining by Giunta e General Council.
It's not about any exchange, but only about trying to have a place where to process a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then will be dissolved because this institution must have a precise time term.
In June, the elder declares that we will present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has carried out for the future of the main city of Rome."
To those who are accusing the Commission of uncertainty as it is committed to its opinion, Germany will say: "All matters are about the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their opinions.
If they are qualitative as we are the Commission Attali, and so I am in Rome, its benefit will be determining.
Policy is too often addressed to daily problems and advantages that will be provided from time to time.
Instead, we want to look forward, in the deepest perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and his future.
Furthermore, the elder of Rome wants to highlight that "This Commission is not even an unnecessary business or blaf: it is totally free, Roman citizens of state or euro and serves to think and involve the best intelligence that the main city has."
For Alemanna, in principle, "the strategic plan is needed as the default point, nor definitively or irrelevant, so that it may be possible to allow our town to rise at the level necessary, and to think with the unified spirit of his future."
The future, which, determines the elder of Rome, "see limits only to the current general border, but will look for a lot away" not only in the future metropolitical city and its legal status, the main city, but also in the role that Rome can and must play as the main city of Europe and the Mediterranean.
The anti-American president is already aware of why.
A known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be another anti-American President."
It was Jimmy Carter who decreased the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obam are just growing at the time when the election date is near.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But obama has a steadfastness: he thinks he will get to the highest post of the people who had two and five black senators all over here!".
In the past of these attacks, they do not say much; these are the attacks of the racial poultry, and they do not answer the question of the electors: will be a good president? And then we have an advance; everyone says that Obama wins and with a great shock.
In this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the United States of South, wrote a comment: at least once in the election cabin, we know who gives his voice to the American patriot.
It's going on on a page of American mentality that remained screwed up to the last time.
Tell what you want, finally, we'll take care of it ourselves who's going to make sure if Obam or McCain."
There are people who swore: if he had to win Obama, they went out of America.
It's things that haven't been stated yet, it seems to be almost a certain success of the black candidate.
However, over all these views of democracy, George Bush's main weapons.
1500 people asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a bathroom to the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers were delivered, and the Americans were not forced to packaging.
Yet, Iraq became for Bus's weakness.
Whoever goes to Georgie W will have to do a great job.
The United States economic colaps also felt: in newspapers, there is a period of monitoring, and many accuses the Internet, "builder" pressure.
The Research Center asked five hundred journalists about their profession and the presence of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimists about their future.
Nevertheless, the questions were not intermediately said that they had less anxieties about confidence.
It doesn't feel isolation as ever.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis in 2008 is the crisis of a devastated economic model.
Yet, the screens carried out in newsroom, in the room where editors work to give newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the questioned journalists, it is a problem that must be resolved whether we do not want traditional journalism to change in principle as it understands its broad public.
The American journalist's progressive, but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten press journalists and the executive elders are convinced that the newspaper is a wrong way.
The local group has 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for a journalist to see where the web goes.
More publishing develops the way to the Internet, which many people say as a "builder" pressure.
"Economic pressure", on which journalists warn, increased to 79%.
Five hundred questioned journalists have admitted that they are inclined to ↓a in na·a that they "do something good for their newspaper."
The biggest disaster in the American journalism is among those who drive newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of the leaders at national level are real that their reporters share their values, while the value at local level is decreased by 23%.
This has what to do with "the real work".
The leaders who think that they lose work for three years are 47% at the national level.
As regards journalists, they move to 30%.
This is "the right job" about the staff (our editors, etc.) in America is still on the daily order.
Only 13% of journalists are working on s~a.
In such a huge nation as Usa, with three million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, dies, TV and Internet employees often offer what they want, and thus it is a question to take or leave.
The leader sufficed to pay a huge payment and the editor can also produce $10,000 a monthly without paying money and insurance.
As regards the allowed, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year to the reach of 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own knowledge, are often sick during one year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: SOUD in Rome, DANILO COPPOL STAY IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the delivery of a businessman with Daniel Coppoly realities, who requested to be moved from his city, Grottaferrats, to the apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankrots in relation to anti-profession in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process to its own costs, he received a last week of release from the household procedure, which was changed to the needed permanent residence in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michael Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, requested that a reality businesser can change the place of residence from the foreign city to the main city.
However, according to the Court of Justice, this movement (in which pm was exposed) would allow him to influence his company and reach evidence that accused him.
Elity in danger
This fact has been shown a few days ago when the Commission voted against the salvation plan for 700 billion dollars to the White House submitted: a significant part of the Americans was more interested and interested in Wall Street's relief than on the salvation of the economy.
It also confirms yesterday New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican side, even more divided between its old soul East Coast, more milder, closer to the federal institutions and business, and its new soul, which is, rather, to preserve, an enemy against" Washington" and the world's finance, particularly strong in the states in the central and south.
The soul that was arrogantly shown by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just emotional thing is the only example of changes, large changes already shown by the current economic agriculture: not only in the United States, but in the entire west, and may not only here.
Like in Usa, Europe seems that this crisis works as an accelerator of age that has already been incubing, which uses in the new climate and finally grows into light.
In the context of these areas, the renewal, the outstanding market life, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain renewal of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, the crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong contributions to the deployment, but in particular the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one country.
What has now created a political problem for those who lead him: this means how to answer the challenges and protests of people and families, which are otherwise the electors.
Shortly the crisis seems to be economically worldwide, but politically almost exclusively national.
The political internationality seems to be essentially outside the game or is not enough to add: a clear evidence of the European Union, which is divided between different interests and different state strategy, which cannot be decided for one common policy line.
So everyone expects the principles of the government of each individual State, the salvation plans, the market rescue, the new rules and mainly the distribution of funds: at the moment when we get into a difficult time, only the states of economic employment, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to get everything right.
And also their own needs and authorisations to use them: two sources of unpair values, in certain circumstances where no market and no international organization may never be available in the same way.
This new emphasis, which causes a state-national element, is finally in full compliance with the more significant experience that will try to condemn the latest economic progress to one factor that is closely associated with it: territorial responsibility.
Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we entered the Kingdom of the Network, even more sophisticated, imaginative, while we were convinced that the world financials were already intended to rule the world, from nothing we realized that our future would still have to go more with such little non-ternal things like water, oil, oil.
All things that would be said can be transferred from one place on the ground to the other, however, in any case, are connected, absolutely, to the covered space, the territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler is certainly having a lot more card in the hand than who I'm not eating and who's feeling that he lives in a place without birds, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper, which, however, predicts wrongdoing.
Whoever speaks about the territory, state, government, is inevitably talking about politics, then about leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence evidences are created.
On the one hand, knowing that it is objectively necessary for authoritary leadership, request for someone who could be captured.
On the other hand, the discreditation of the existing leaders, particularly the economic, which has shown the same unexpected and full of dark places.
And together, something more deeper and in a certain sense of disabilities: discretion, insatisfactory, feelings of incapacity and inaccessibility, trying to control the entire government class in the West countries.
It seems that in the wide masss of the population of conviction, it is still more extensive than that their actions are the same as the thoughts of the elite, as their feelings and the way of living, as their culture in the right meaning that the elite has already overcome its time and is lowly to the views of the nature.
The request for leading is shortly survived from the ground, but a strong movement to remove government classes and traditional political arrangements is shown in continuing electoral declines or in unexpected changes in collective movements in the latest and last time, from the conservative attack in Russia-Bavor to the fall of American congressors in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American Congressmen against Bush (and may have to do with this also the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the idea that traditional elites, their sides, their programmes, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their creditive intellectuals, somebody would say their format, have still more problems to understand, so represent, which, not since today, is created in deep levels of western companies and that economic crisis re-enhances, grows, potentially overflowing.
Before this, it would be forbidden to talk about the persistent mass rebellion.
But we can't say that it means to have very open eyes.
Super lepidlo to walk through walls
Overcome gravity laws thanks to super lepidle and in the future walk through walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of different American research centers and now the four team of institutions has been very close to him.
Scientists were able to maintain the stokilogram body attached to the vertical wall using only 2.5 centimetres of the quarter.
STUDIUM – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute and the University of Air Force.
The material found by the team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a special carbon structure called carbon pauses.
“We can imagine as a series of bubbles placed as an arranged spaget tube” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute in Atlantic.
Scientists were inspired by the feet of a gecon, covered by microscopic stones that enable animals to defeat the perfect addedness.
The tests carried out on different materials such as glass, Teflon and the glass paper showed that the new lepidlo is ten times stronger than the feet of these plasmoids and at the same time simply gets away from the wall” explains Liming Dai, the Engineer Factory of Dayton University.
CHODIT ON THE THIS? -"This material could be useful as a temporary lepidlo" adds Liming Dai.
Hope to go through the walls like Spiderman? I hope so, but researchers think of a far less fascinating use as the connection of electrical devices, because passive carbon tubes are the heat and electricity leaders.
Others could be related to aircraft engineering .
In time, no super heroes.
Next – The University in Berkley, California, is also a research of a new lepidle.
In one article of the magazine American Chemical Society, the Californian men represented the lepidlo formed from micro-flakes as hairs that are cleaned from the pulmonary movement on the border to continue to keep perfect advantage.
Medicinal products: never with juice
Take care of the grip, rubber and jabble juice.
If you take these drinks which are mainly consumed in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their use changes in strengthening or decreasing health results.
To David Bailey, professor Western Ontario, in London, highlights the risk of juices both prepared and fresh in combination with some medicines, at the 263. National meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelonia, he calls for a new relief: enough is a grip, pool and jabble juice to reduce the needed life of some protecting medicines, to cancel their successful effects and to expose risk patients.
Grep juice has already been accused that it is responsible for increased to the toxic effects of some anti-arithmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolics, antihistamines and neurological medicines.
ARTICLES IN RISIC – It was notified by the Italian Medical Agency in the information bulletin two years ago and burshed the doctors and patients to not appreciate the risks resulting from this smile and to take care of what they drink in the case of taking medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEYEN GRAPEFRUIT – Experts also include substances that deteriorate the medicine.
Long list of rubber and other juices.
Furthermore, Michele Carruby, Director of the National University of Pharmacological Department in Milan: "These discoveries are immediately announced to the most different international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange the information instructions of medicines.
So you read illustrate the pharmacists you receive and if you reach something unexpected, do not be disappointed, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for a clearing” stressed the expert for the Ansa Agency.
Nobel for the economy of Paul Krugman
Nobel's price was assigned to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan, who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding Bush's administrative, economic and political steps.
A few months after the atents in September 2001, in the days when Enron broke, Krugman said in one comment issued in New York Times that the second event would be, in the meaning of the United States history, much more important than the first.
Preliminary responsibility, which caused a polymetic disorder, which was calculated after a year, but which appeared to be precise.
“I am surprised and shocked, with what kind of collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the interest of the public, Krugman announced at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenza Biniho Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "the economy of great importance" but also a popularizer who has "very aggression," especially critical against Bush's liberal administration.
Open Office, we have the third issue of the package "anti-Microsoft" here
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, the open source package of the personal manufacture that aims to get to more than one, from home to office, experts to public administration, as a free alternative of a known Microsoft Office.
After approximately the annual work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide publics with different news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window are added further, far more significantly, as the compatibility of the Apple Mac OS X system and the support of the new ODF format (Open Document Format), the last ISO standard version.
The design is also designed to cooperate with the Office package 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
They are particularly interesting in some models such as that allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, which are useful for e-mail transmission, or the possibility of transfering the PDF folder to the graphical performance model and keeping the pp view of the page.
We can still create "PDF hybrid" documents from this view, which like the typical graphics of the Adobe format and the properties of the table process or the text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within the application programmes: in the excellence, there is a possibility to work between different partners and to avoid conflicts with changes, the text programme assigns to each cooperation one color to comments to be clearer in the review phase.
Some companies are also working on the transfer of some Open Office to the Web (on the cloud), and in the next weeks, the final outcome should be stopped.
The Italian version is possible to download to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, which was added to the ética version of the mirror from Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the package is usually available to operate Linux system.
The installation cd may also be sent to request at home or to work.
And if the theme of freedom can be an enlargement to households, just to the Open Office's trade package is a lot, and it can already be calculated with the various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are no offers of training, councilation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business inspections.
Open Office is composed of five main models: Writer, for replacer Word; Calc is a table processer that refers to Excel replacement; Impress for presentation like Powerpoint; Dbase is a program that allows to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 550 million downloads, and when we consider that we are 3 million and 600 thousand until today, with a new version, this estimated number can also be convinced.
The results of Kohla are also positive, it's the fourth case inside
New position in the last case of Tour de France: This is about Bernhard Kohla, from Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winning trick of the best top.
The report was sent to the L'Equipe journal pages.
26th year old Kohl is the fourth leader to position on Cera, Epo third generation, after the Italian Riccard Riccó and ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The results of the blood samples of Kohla fall into those performed in the last weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If the control analysis confirms a positive at Ceru, Rakušan will lose the third place on Tour and will have to take up the two years of disability.
The Kohla positive report on Epo third-generation confirms the French Antido Agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Press, that he has already informed the outcome of the Russian government authorities.
In 26th year, Rakušan was located on the gradual victories behind Spain Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evansema, also obtained a pointed trick of the best top.
IMAGINE: New York You say it's Italian Rasist?
Italy, "as the country of immigrants only in the last house, has been transformed into the primary objective of the promotors" adopted with the opposite.
It changes a beautiful country to a nation of racists? So it is asked in a long article of New York Times, which has made this article a debate on the subject of racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milana, because he stole the box of sugar.
This case shows what New York Times defines "paradox north": the north are at the same time those who are registered "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-promotional thoughts in the land and the strongest support of North Liga".
To confirm an increased pressure between Italy and the promotors, NYT refers to cases of intolerance from Milán, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturn.
Not just that.
The new legislation requested by the Legal, which is trying to enhance the mobility and facilitates the elimination of illegal promotors, is also quoted as an example of climate change in Italy.
The tendence highlighted as well as by Papees, as the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedet XVI in Quirinale, requested the state and church to work together on racism destruction."
Students of dear income victims - up to 900 euros per room
The research market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, the Salaries Boards, a single room can be found in Milan to 900 euros, in Florence 700, Neapoli 650, in Rome 600.
"Jav has already reached the dimensions that all levels of students have lost the right to study because of the totally high prices that their families have to pay – explains the leading offices for the Sunia study, Laura Mariani – a large request from the students in this town deformed the market in such a way that it has increased the price growth that has grown to the residents."
In the majority of cases of income offers, there are a number of transactions: with free way, not registered, without limited income, related undertakings.
For Sunji, there is an exceptional principle that might be able to regulate prices through the review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milána, in Brianza, one bed of approximately 450 euros is needed for a single room of 650 (banda Nere) over the average 800 (≥ 800 Lambiates, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria).
In Florence there is one bed in average 350/400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single hall.
In Rome, in the central university areas (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 lions in a double.
Values are lower (550 euros per unit) in areas near the final universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Only if we move to periphers: 300 euros per hole and 450 for a single hole room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar.
In Neapoli there are 300/450 euros for bed, for room from 400 to 600 euros, with highest prices in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bara, they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single hole room.
In smaller cities, prices are absolutely lower, but they have more impacts on the citizens' economy.
In cities like Perugia, where the most often seems to be rewarded for students from the country outside the European Union, there is finally another anomalia: an increase of about 25-30% of the payment they want for students in comparison with the Italian.
By the old movie of Paradiso, towns break historical rooms
Kinematographic historical salons are closed in the benefits of Multiplex.
"The city without kine is like blind, it's like an eyeless face."
The picture offered by Giuseppe Tornator is successfully documented in the large Italian city centers, but also in foreign cities.
The process of restriction of kine, the creation of large multishalls in the area and the following shipment of monosales in central cities is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and unreverseable, but also has all the characters of the true cultural crime.
Often the historical places getted by the \"is as when they came about a friend, a known person with whom we shared a road and a lot of emotion," feels the recorder of New Movie Paradiso, a film that received the Tornator Oscar twenty years ago, and the high price of the portion in Cannes, and who told the poesi of a village cinema and disorder because of the way of life that about the cine was lost forever.
The values obtained by Anece, the main company of operators, speaks: In the past five years, the door of 316 kines of the traditional type has been closed, and the highest rooms were payed mainly in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Neapoli, Bologni and Roman, 6 less in Torina, 5 in Palerma.
The most achieved regions are at the first place Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinema sales followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And by the evidence that the first responsible for their mistakes is a multi-x approach, these three Italian regions have registered the highest number of new Chinese multisale: 195 more paid in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 and in Toscana, as well as Emilia-Romagna.
“Italian process has developed irrationally” says Paolo Protti, President Anecu, “is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survivors are already survived because when one cinema in the city is closed, not all his visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about an insufficient contribution to the fund in the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
In view of moral and ethical, it is a claim that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, there would be a need between 16 and 18 million euros per year.’
It is interesting in the Bologn case, the first Italian city who cares about closures and who has decided to find the east signature of the protocol between communities and Anecs, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinema and in historical centres, as well as in the area.
Among the scheduled standards are the steps of tax impact in the benefits of operators and the benefits of the public in relation to mobility: the walls will be able to go into a year with limited transport area and will have special prices for stoping and at some parkings.
“I like this initiative” says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that the remaining cities will follow the example of the Bolognly implementing other measures.”
However, it is certain that to be able to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional salons must improve the quality of sound and image because today's public is more important.
The defense of the traditional cine was the subject that was most important: the closing of Super cine in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adulthood, was certain that it convinced me to establish the New Paradiso film, which I had thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go through before the already closed Rial or Quirinal in the street Na日, where I shared so much emotional to do not have to look at the signatures of the hard work, I turn on the other side.”
Connection between the political and the Mafia's 'ndranghet' group, senior Gioie Tauro in the processing
"Starosta from Gioie Tauro was willing to modify the elections of the city office according to the interests of the Mafian Piroma Group."
The accusations that the Government against Mafia in Kalábria is against anxiety and age Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarna Carla Martellima, who is in prison today because of external cooperation with the Mafian organization, are difficult.
In the railways also Gioacchino Piroma, an old ionist between clone and public administration, and his uncle's lawyer, the boss' name, already charged by mafia's crimes, sentenced to 10 million euros.
"Ignore all legal and moral standards, as well as healthy mind," writes the state representatives when two local administrations were willing to pay the consent to the lawyer Piroma.
"So the Mafian group would – writes the judges – officially enter the city offices and facilitate the great options of control and management of the public administration."
The President of the Catholic Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organized crime underlines are in his country a lot: "There are some in which the concentration of mafia is stronger than in the remaining, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that deal with the 'ndranghetta' pressures, the heroes who are still unclean."
Today's prisons follow after the prison from July last year that the police showed that the Mafian Group of Piroma had final principles .
Since the end of April last year - the city Council of Gioii Tauro has been released since 1991, the proposed connection between organized crime and local administration has also been set out by local policies in general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of the Christian Democrats, who was chosen by the head of the right centre's coalic after a strange choice in May.
He cryed for scandal when Prefecture ordered to solve the General Council.
He called for the responsibility of the Minister inside Marca Min° and accused him that he had all been based on political matters, but the judges in the Criminal Regulation today explain that the Mafian Group has grown so far as to request the amendment to the A3 project.
From the other votes made against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutor, she said "will move the committees, the representative of a very closer group, as well as it is generally known, to Piroma, and to adjust the elections of the public administration to the interests of the Mafian Group."
When energy is born out of the wall, the big are in the game.
It's an unnecessary lodge that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and now begins to discover a large world energy society.
Wolves, puzzles, springs, dilution are new sources of unexpected energy on which the sight of colosses such as Chevron, who now trys to stretch up his hands on these sources.
The opportunity to create energy from sea movements has been studied for more than 100 years and in the 70s, research has been intensified in relation to the first crucial crisis.
When the roof price was decreased about 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy came to the side, but now the ecological organization and the new increase in the rope price gave the sector a new impulse.
World Energy Council (ECC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 per cent of world electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the sea wall movement.
this amount would be a double part of energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
Moreover, there's also springs and springs and springs.
Worry's going to attack.
Enersis, who agreed in 2005 to establish equipment in Northern Portugal.
When this purpose was announced, it seemed to have a huge revolution.
After two years, the marine energy is still more than the traditional power of the marine energy than the traditional energy.
"Chevron studies the energy of the oceans -- the speaker of one company connected to the United States Round, in the economic day newspapers of Wall Street Journal -- and they think about the possibility to cooperate with us."
The cooperation we consider is about the achieving authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the breakdown of the project for the use of marine energy on Alaska.
We can't underestimate this signal, especially when we take into account that just on the United States Alliance has continued to be more difficult and the president Bush has recently come with the plan for a new turnover.
Besides Chevron, they follow the track of marine energy and Ver > Power Inc. From New York and the Ocean Power from New Jersey and afterwards invested sums, even though they are not detailly known, show a growing interest according to observers.
Technology, which is needed to work.
Experts are talking about the first beginning, because they do not know the impact of the use of marine energy on life.
Meanwhile, the equipment in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause big eco-problems.
For more energy production, however, it is necessary to use with more impact on the middle.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are connected.
The force of the wall that moves with battles up and down is changed by the help of wars and cylinders to hydraulic pressure within these fights.
Pressure spreads the turbine that adds energy to the generator.
Energy is obtained at the edge of subseas cabs.
Meanwhile, projects have four devices of this type, which only wait for federal approval and part of energy can serve for military engines.
Instead, Ver > Power is already producing energy for the purchase centre and parking using six pd-sea turbines in the East River.
The water movement during the combustion and the dilution causes turbines to turn around which the generator lives through this rotating movement.
Ver · it appeared that it had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation for the possibility of use of this energy.
After the walls, after the inflammation and after the dilution.
The special interest at this moment is the potential of influence and deficiency, which they are called in the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is an independent factor, the adhesion and the dilution are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the wave, and this is the fall and more consistent as the energy source.
Just to the energy of the enlargement and deficiency of states such as New York, Alaska and other coast states have already invested 7 and half a million dollars in 2008 and have predicted up to 35 million dollars for 2009.
