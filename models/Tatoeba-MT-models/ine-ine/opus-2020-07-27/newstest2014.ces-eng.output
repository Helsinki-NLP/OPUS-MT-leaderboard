Black box in your car?
While the American road designers are trying to find money in the remote network, many begin to see a solution in a small black box that easily will enter your car's device table.
The devices following each miles of engineering and transfering this information to the authorities are the nuclear controversial effort of Washington and the State planning offices to renew the old system of financing of American main roads.
Of course, the gradual drafting of departments once enhanced the intensity of the debate and the appearance of the most different sexes.
Libertarians meet the ecological groups and lobby for the government to use these small boxes that would mention their own miles and may also where you go, and then use these information to build a tax dimension.
The party is scared.
The American Union for Civil Freedom is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with privacy protection.
And while Kongres can't agree if he continues, some states don't expect anything.
They find out how they can be moved to the system in which the driver is paying for kilometers of the road.
Thousands of motorists have already been tested with black boxes, some of which have a GPS monitoring.
This is a real need for our nation.
"It is not the matter when we can choose much," said Hasan Ikhrrata, Executive Director of the State Management Association in South California, who plans for this State to start tracking the miles captured by each California engine in 2025.
It's changing the way we pay these taxes.
That's what he's doing.
The fact is that the Road Confidential Fund financed by the tax payable by the Americans at the stations of shopping stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy so much benzine as before.
Cars will join a lot of kilometers to one gallon.
The single federal tax, 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the 20 years.
As a result of the current high price of benzine, politicians are willing to take tax only for a single center.
"The benzine tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert from the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently placed the monitoring equipment in 500 cars to test this place system for a miles of miles.
"On view it seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts are called a taxation by the number of miles captured.
There is no surprise that this idea likes urbanist liberals because taxes can be used to change the patterns of conduct of drivers, which, for example, can help to limit the transport facilities and the creation of glass gases.
Californian designers are looking forward to this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitional laws on global temperature.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), President of the Committee on Transport, said that it also seems to be the most important alternative.
The representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation's organization are also drawn up the idea that the drivers will pay for the own miles.
"It's not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for the Strategy of Reason.
People pay directly for what they're doing.
The initiative is also supported by two former American transport ministers who invited the Congress in 2011 to issue the payment direction for a miles.
The American Senate of Loni approved a pilot project for 90 million USD, which had to include approximately 10 000 cars.
However, the leadership of the public representatives has refused and thus acted due to the concerns of foreign legislators representing residents whose daily life often means to break a lot of kilometers for work outside the city.
Yet, several states and cities are going forward to their own plants.
The most bitter is Oregon, which included 5 000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the tax for a mile instead of the tax for benzine.
Nevada's pilot project already finished.
New York is just studying the project.
Illinois is trying to do this in a range of cost vehicles.
And coalic I-95, which includes 17 state ministers of transport, together with the coast states on the east (e.g. Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) study how to implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have a delay.
In Nevada, where the equipment was recently equipped with approximately 50 auto volunteers, the drivers were concerned that the government was able to follow each of their movements.
"The equipment relating to the monitoring of the type Big Brother and similar matters were a big problem," Alaudin Khan said, leading to the management of the strategy and operation of the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the experimental project continued, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its websites: “It would be very easy to change these equipment to full-valuable monitoring equipment.”
There is no need to build a huge hardship infrastructure that is unrequiredly spread on the evidence of each day outputs and entrances of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states who are trying to be available with a state that would enable the state to monitor the amount of kilometers of cars, but not exactly when and where.
You can do it, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
She brought some State agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance).
This company has not been involved in the aid of the Government in the control of drivers.
She wanted to pronounce on the emergency market with a legal responsibility in which the drivers would pay on the basis of the amounts of charges.
But this equipment that tests attaches the attention of the road network projectors because it doesn't use GPS and only adds a detailed quantity of information that is regularly recorded by modem.
"The people will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their position and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of big errors occurred.
They're much more nice and less dangerous ways to do it.
The designers in Oregon experiment with the drivers' choice.
They can choose GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment, and they will be determined to pay the payment of the payment based on the average number of miles of prisoners of all the people of the state.
In other places, they hope that the attentionful public will come to this concept, if the equipment are to know more, not less.
In the city of New York, transport officers are trying to develop demanding equipment that would be equipped so that it might be possible to pay payments in parking hours to ensure insurance by miles of prison and collect data on the ability of other drivers, so the motorists can avoid transport clusters.
"The motorists will be willing to participate in this for the value of the benefits offered to them," states the city's project document.
However, some transport projectors would say whether all the payment debates for a milk are not only a major problem.
The Officers of the Metropolit Transport Committee in San Francisco state that the Congress could be able to solve a very simple problem with the bankrotated Road Confidential Fund by the increased gas tax.
A single or annual tax may be covered on the drivers of hybrids or other vehicles that carry out many fuel, so they will pay a just share.
"No radical operation is needed when the rich is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legislative and Public Affairs.
And we'll do that, hundreds of million drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
The CSSD is negotiating Saturday.
Social democracy is deep, humans and grandfathers speak together and want a common procedure.
The social democracy will have a number of weeks to take place a workshop with the perfectly deployed partners, which will set a list of demands for ministerial posts on the table.
Then the CSSD senders shall be sexy coalitic acids or raw to the garden minority government.
Bohuslav Saturday after four days, when he was on the wall of sympathy, he first arrived.
He was not able to control the political graphy yesterday and mainly to make a convinced lie to refuse.
The confirmed negotiator is still only he, the final members of the team shall be allowed after the key meeting of the Centre Executive Committee (TFUE).
I apologize to the members of the gram, and now to the citizens.
He's not lying, in his personal life or in the public.
"It was a mistake," he said after negotiating the most useful social democracy of Michal Hashek.
He added that the first president was missing.
"I will notify my decisions on November 10th," said Hashek.
Similarly, the Chairman of the CSSD Zdenek Schkromach and the Chairman of the Jerony Tejc Club.
But he warned that he was chosen only two days ago.
Both lawyers then announced that they would do everything to make the fifty-year CSSD club sound with one voice.
"I am a member of the CSSD fifteen years, I was loyal to her label and respected the decisions of the parties' bodies."
The next lie in direct transport.
Or did he forget that in the challenge of the Sabbath rejecting and exemption of the negotiating team, the UVV was 57 percent that Bohuslav Saturday is a candidate to the premises?
The Chairman of the CSSD, however, made a powerful enemy army by calling UVV until the next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to ship the e-mails 192 members of this body and the media of the most different wheat and fame, eventually remind of the real mistakes of the Sabbath political career.
It's going to be strongly a snare, the signs of dark connections between the Ulobaron Zenek Bakal and the Saturday Wheel.
The friendship of the Bohuslaw of the Sabbath and the influence of the Advocate of the Sublime Council will be gathered.
Conflicts in the South African or Moroccolesian Organization of the CSSD.
Warnings are the words of the island primator and the Sobots of Petra Kajnara: "I signed Chart 77 so that the idiots do not rule the country."
If the UVV had meet this week, the lies would probably have been brought to the ritual sacrifice of their lives.
The traitors will get their head in the middle and stay.
And now the victory boss CSSD will then end with the surrounding Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russia is urgent
The coats of his mouth indicate an unclean smile, and then only the deep breathes, "It's worthwhile."
Cooperation with the Organizational Olympias team in Soči 2014 is a little more difficult, according to Martin Doctor.
What was on the past olympy, we can forget.
"Nothing doesn't work the same," says the chief of the Czech Olympical Mission.
What's exactly going on?
A number of things works less, not exactly.
It's so mature.
With regard to the factur, they are relatively ≥, not so much as to add information about the principles.
Maybe we have been looking for three months to add us how individual villages will be officially designed, and they could do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
In a number of things, they still communicate.
Is the Olympical village already delivered?
But it's not a catastrophe.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, houses stand.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the grounds ready?
Just a basic beton, so this was a state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we come there on January 26, it'll still feel a lepidlo.
And if they don't run, what?
The president Putin would think that he's called the army?
That's exactly what it's supposed to do.
It's not that Olympical villages = the town of the town of the town.
Rather, it's dangerous that they don't reach the road change, for example, they don't make details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to take a hole with ourselves from the London Hers.
But I think they're giving it to the bathroom.
How many Czech sporters could go to Sochi?
Now they are approximately 78, even if, depending on nominal criteria, the number is changed.
Maybe they're gonna go out in the triple that they've taken.
Nobody needs to doubt about the prisoner Martin Sablik, but otherwise it's in the development.
Is the way to Sochi still waiting for you?
No, if anything happens, I should fly there until January 26.
How houses will look in the Olympical village, we know.
We even measured some of the things ourselves, and we didn't believe just the figures.
We're also preparing a number of other things in the field of transport.
And what does the boss do a hundred days before the Olympical Game?
I prepare for the annual evaluation of individual olympical sports plus I do the agenda in the meaning of communication with the Organizational Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an ecological olympy, the plan is to screw his secret garments.
The winter sports fans are already holding a meter to start olympical hers in Sochi, other people look for their preparation with more fears.
The Russian olympy, whether it's going to be in February, it's going to cover another scandal.
The Russians, of course, are not able to fulfil the promise that the preparation and performing of hers or in the least, does not disturb the nature of the Krasnodar Country on the basis of Kavkaza, where thousands of sports and tens of thousands of visits will go in four months.
Recently after the olympy in Vancouver, the Russian Latch had a very high place, Canadian olympias were written as the most sensitive to life.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putina to arrange games with "null waste" has been taken for a long time.
Reporters of the AP Agency last week discovered the building material in the village of Ashtyr near Sochi.
Then the pack full of building material, pneu, canisters and isolation pigs already found in August, which they immediately announced.
The Russian offices have gone rocks and sticks.
Just for a minute.
Last week, reporters had a view of the size of three balls.
It's not the only one in the places that appeared some, described the British magazine The Times.
The Russian railways are working on the place, a state monopol, which builds about six miles [60 km] travel between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
A company who already had 280 billion rubbles has led one of the close Putin collaborations of Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were prohibited that some of the subcontracters found a bathroom.
Local residents are already deceived.
According to the people of Achstyr, around three months of day and night, he has driven a carrier full of waste material.
According to experts, waste is threatened to contaminate the local Mzymth river, other rivers, and finally also the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the soft waters in the next ten to 15 years," said the British newspaper Vladimir Kimajev from the EWC ecological non-request organization.
Illegal stocks are not the only problem of the Russian Organization Committee and Government.
The most dear olympias in history, according to opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: Games in Sochi will be $51 billion, while the annual olympy in Peking 2008 was $43 billion.
Lone games in London were only 19 billion and mentioned in Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project detentions and concerns, if finally enough snow, reports have also been reported that human rights are not respected in the work of sport and infrastructure.
Last month one of the workers sent his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also both of how Russian organizations are in accordance with the new law that prohibits promotion of homosexuality during hers.
Some visitors want Russian gays to support the olympics.
A young couple raised up to living with parents, a new house offers private to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and ́tes has been assigned to a house at a park that lies on the angle of two streets, whereas the ground is sometimes covered.
The request continued that two generations will live in the house that would want to live together, but everyone should have a separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets, and on the quietly covering ground.
Thus, the architects decided to place every home to one of the fathers of the house.
"We respected family links, stories and ambitions associated with this place."
"Tree distant houses are connected by some ways through the external object, so everyone knows the presence of others, but they have their privacy," explains designers.
Parents' homes are at the level of garden with an old boat, to which family traditions and spectaculars are weakened.
The single parts of the house are easily discoverable, so it is different from the different final adjustment of the fasad.
While the main segment of the building is of beton, the surface of which was created by the panels of the pens, the part of the office is mixed by white and the remaining elements have remained in pure beton operation without further adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely exposed, so the house's interior is very related to the foreigner.
The household of parents, exactly the kitchen, the food and the inhabitants, covers a small garden with a tree that has great importance for the family.
The internal connection to the external is undercutting the side wall that begins on the garden and continues to the residence.
A kitchen room in the house of a young couple.
The young couple enters home by the main entrance in the hall, and then stood by the steps into his room.
Just steps are the main dominant of the house's interior.
It allows their boys to slippe through them with a shadow of natural light.
That's what the centuries tried to distinguish the house from others and to print something unique to him.
The household of a young couple is negotiated as one open space with a kitchen part, a food and a resident in the cooking.
Only the walls are divided from the terrace with the switching doors.
A residential area with food and kitchen parts in the house of a young couple.
The second pattern is composed as one large open space that is freely over to the terrace, from which is a beautiful view of the Tokyo valley.
The office alone in the highest stage is taken into a clean combination of white and black.
It's a dominant element of the house's interior.
The young couple enters home by the main entrance, gets in the entrance hall, and then stands on the stage up.
Protect the academic freedom, it applies to the Earth and the ODS.
In recent months, I repeatedly invited students, pedagogies and leaders of high schools in several countries to protect academic freedom from the election campaign that president Milos Zeman held at schools.
I met more or less successful.
The Rector of Masarykov University in Brna, who refused the presentation of the Honorous President of the SPOZ - Earth in the prevalence period, has even been taken in the form of no call for the celebration of the State of the Republic of Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who have not been so firm and have enabled Miloshe Zeman to visit: High Technical Learning in Brna, Gymnazium Hladnov in Istrava, High Business School in Iceland, Commercial Academy in Kalifornia, University J.E. Purkina in Ustu nad Labem.
Now we meet in Pardubians with the continued promotion of the policy at high schools.
The newly selected rapporteur for ODS, thanks to the Faculty of Electrotechnologies and Informations University Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to get away from its academic facilities, and it seems to be normal.
Mr. Professor, it's not the same thing, for example, as if you stayed in the oldest town of the smaller city.
Do you want to join the Chefs of the CSSD, who are currently responsible for the lawyer and the leader and as they degrade both calls?
That's what you say to the people that they're allowed to be able to put these two handful backs on the left.
I know, here's a example of Michael Haska, who even handles a few decades once.
But it's not just an example of a person you should conduct.
We will also find an opaque and positive example of MUDr. Stépánki Frańk, who would like to leave the missionary post to be able to be fully guided by the city of Pardubice.
However, I vote on my recommendation to leave thanks to you is that you will violate the academic landscape of the University of Pardubice during the same time.
Pardubian ODS leads your current action on both places as a advantage for the University.
"Your" school, however, will be able to help you, even without being grateful.
I think a similar view like me and the director Miroslav Ludwig will have your students too.
Thus, consider your departure and keep your face.
Otherwise, you can say the choices will count it to you in the next choices.
And that doesn't have to have long duration.
In Kunovica bubble zeli, chemicals in ́n't adds
More than thousands of tons of acid green will be produced in the Slovak fruit of Kuno, which belongs to the Hamé Food Group in the next months.
The season started here in October and takes about half a year.
He has still produced in a traditional way here since 1925, so he's running directly in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about funny.
Our officers found a change of the 10-mile-meter road.
Each of the ten dances will enter 15 to thirty tons of green, filling one length of three changes," introduced the Slowake Fruta David Kladrob.
Green heads drive to the area of the company directly from their farmers, mostly from Ostrojska and Brussels.
The employees of the fruit after the green is cleaned, removed the costs and thrown into the coat.
From there, the green already covered falls into the basens of a six-meter deep depth, in which white clothes and bottles work continually.
That's what they're doing with unexpected air.
The layer of green collected is covered with a flash and wears water.
"Therefore, the green crochet will take six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk washing without any additive of sugar-based substances," stressed the manager Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to the production in household submines, individual layers of work to requests of salt and landscape.
The green whistle travels to the full line.
It is afraid of sweet oxygen pressure in bottles or glasses and detailed sterilation.
Hame adds oxygen green primarily to the foreign and Slovenian market.
The interest is also registered in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in relation to follow-up from the United States
Edward Snowden, reporter of the American Rapporteur Services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to provide evidence to the German Parliament if the United Nations Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander ́do were able to provide answers to their activities.
The German lawyer Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was assigned asylum, and acted with him about the opportunity to witness in Germany.
The letter from Mr. Snowden, who sent the rapporteur to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although my efforts were evidently positive, the government continues to behave as the flows and trys to criminalize political proofs with difficult claims that don’t give a space for dealing.”
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that it is not aware that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to be accused of criminal offences against it.
The accusations made by the United States' Justice Ministers included the spionship and the stole of State ownership.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Ministry of Inside, said for the Time Online magazine: "When Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officers, we will find a way to enable it."
The pressure between the United States and Germany began to be stuck when the claim that NSA was listening to the phone of Angely Merkel's office.
Thomas Opermann, a member of the parliamentary panel, watching the report, said that if any opportunity was to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness, "without being a dangerous and totally destroyed relations with the United States", it should be done so.
Mr. Sträbele, Parliament's lawyer for the German Green Page, has published on its Twitter contribution, which is with Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, two German journalists brought her back.
Mr. Strobele said that, according to the former NSA contractual lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had gone once.
Mr Snowden would be witnessing in Germany, he would need to ensure that there will be "secure", said the member of the Parliament.
Mr. Snowden, in his letter, said that he was taking a close and enduring campaign associated with the persecution that caused him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the world to his "political exhibition" gave him courage.
The citizens of the entire and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of the non-representable system of public monitoring.
The letter includes the proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian action will be resolved."
The killing hates us, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmers
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan was the former head of the state.
For the rules of the Red Khmers, which were based on maoism and nationalism in 1975, lived as a result of suffering, hunger, disease, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodians, thus at least a quarter of the population.
In 2010, the International Criminal Court for Cambodja has granted that commander unrealisticly reviewed S-21.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accusations of genocides and crimes against mankind in the meantime of torture, injury and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were stuck by believeing that they acted in the best interest of the people and did not know what the range of killing is.
"It's easily to say that I had to understand everything, to understand everything and then to put into and put it in," he declared on Thursday Khieu Samphan before the court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never commanded the Red Khmer Castle to "made with people or kill them to repair their food or to feed genocide".
But he acknowledged the moral responsibility for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely forgive publics, victims, their families, all the Cambodia people," he said.
Fifty-five-year Bin Sivla, who came to the Red Khmer regime on eleven relatives, AFP agent said that Noon Chea's excuse can't be accepted."
"He lied to us."
"I just want to be forgiven the guilt."
"It doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his submission wouldn't be killed," added she, "the leaders of the Red Khmers are "worrer than the monster."
Before the court, he also had to become a "Ministry of the Red Khmers Ieng Sary's regime, who died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, who was the Socious Ministry, in September 2012 the Court considered an incapable process for demention.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines wants to pay the manual liabilities
Frontier Airlines plans in its years to set up up up to 100 USD for the storage of the hand-in-law on the cart.
Frontier Airlines plans to impose up to 100 USD for the hand-in-law and 2 USD for coffee or sodium, although in their middle announcement they said that travellers would be able to leave the whole pool.
The new payment for the handhouse is related to the liabilities in the top deposit space, so small liabilities under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier's company says that he will pay 25 USD if the payment is paid before, and 100 USD if travelers wait until they come to the gate.
The speaking company Frontier Kate O'Malley stated that the staff payment has a trip to encourage the traveller to get the payment forward.
"Don't do this payment," she said.
The aircraft firms began to make the first and second commitments granted in 2008.
The travellers tried to avoid these taxes and stick into the handholds hidden in the place where they could mostly, so there was often a mistake in this space.
Payments are one of the ways that travelers learn to take less things on the palub.
O'Malley said the meaning of this new payment doesn't get any more money.
It is that Frontier's most faithful customers have completely claimed that the location in the top place is still more difficult.
Travellers who buy their aircraft on the websites of the company will pay.
This means that one traveller at the front front of Frontier's port could bring a commitment for which he does not pay anything, while the second traveler in the front will pay 100 USD for the same commitment.
O'Malley said that web pages and procedures will be adjusted to ensure that travellers will learn about payment before their arrival to the port.
The new payment of Frontier for the manual commitment has been made until the year before, but the date has not yet been set.
Travellers often get to taxes for taxes and other taxes, but aircraft companies love them.
It claims that manipulation is committed to money, and the travellers who request this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider another commitment payment as a sign that the aircraft companies are trying to choose enough money to cover the airport costs after years.
But most of them haven't been charged for hands.
The Spirit Airlines was the first of the main commitments three years ago and the other underlying company Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only company who has such taxes is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says adviser in Jay Soren Air Air Air, who carefully follows additional taxes.
In its report from 2011, he estimated that the taxation for the handholds of the spirit company would bring 50 million USD annually.
Sorensen, an ancient leader of Midwest Airlines, has recently flighted to the spirit company and was surprised of what he saw at the door when the travelers met the unconcerned taxation of the Spirit for the hand-in-law company.
"Income in the aircraft was the best I ever saw in my flight career," he said.
I was waiting to see the teeth and the hair.
The aircraft was full, he said, "and the outcome was running in the wheat."
Frontier also applies for coffee, tea, sodow and juice.
Frontier pointed out that travelers who get limonada or juice can keep their whole coffee and coffee will be completed freely.
The water will continue to be free.
In 2008, the US Airways tried shortly to carry out a drink tax, but after the trip of travellers after seven months later, and no other significant aircraft company imitated it.
Frontier's last course to pay the hand-life if the traveller does not buy years directly from this aircraft company, it is its last attempt to fix customers directly on its website.
Airlines pay the Internet road to sellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each sale aircraft.
This has led to all aircraft companies to lead travelers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do this through the Internet travel agencies.
Frontier's company, however, continued in this area.
In September, she began to give customers who purchased the Internet road to the Agency only a half miles in the program of integrity.
In the middle, she cut out the recompense for 25 percent of miles from the road.
So the road to Frontier is a 1000 miles long bought through the Internet road to the Agency means a recompense of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in front of the case they will purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier's company has a customer base in her home town in Denver, but her business begins to be broken and lost money.
According to the financial results listed in the middle of the Republic Airways Holdings markets, the markets fell by 9 per cent and the transport capacity decreased by 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The Republic's company with the sale of this aircraft is trying to solve the financial problems to Frontier.
For the fall of NSA websites, it doesn't accuse hackers, but "Internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency stated last Friday that its websites fell for a few hours a week ago because of an internal error, never because of the hacker attack, as some said on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov pages were not accessible for a few hours tonight because of the internal error occurred during regular update”, said the Spanish Agency in the e-mail declaration.
The problem will be removed during this evening.
The statement that the accident was caused by the DDOS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Before this evening, online servers recorders have changed that NSA websites have not been working at least six hours, and the pages are still not available for some.
Earlier NSA speaker ABC News reported that the internal sensitive networks of the agencies were not "all" threatened.
The speaker said no warm information is threatened.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for organizing NSA pages by DDOS attack.
The DDOS attachments are proposed to float target websites with information until the servers are charged and the page falls.
This cybernetical tactic is relatively simple and the meaning of attacks is not to enter the internal network of the target system.
In the past months, the former superheim Agency of the NSA, which had ever obtained a survival of No such a Agency, has become aware of the discovery of public and home monitoring programmes by the media of public attention and the cosmic criticism of the product of the secrecy of the NSA files from the Agency and their expressions of the former employeee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy involving the Agency enhanced an earlier speculation that today’s accident was a result of a targeted cyber-etch operation.
The winning of Bombardier has fallen through the reduction of supplies and charges
The Canadian Airlines and Dracks Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15% reduction of pure profit caused by smaller number of claims and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contracting problems in the train unit.
The Bombardier company with the seat in Montreal has also not published any data on the aircraft test for its new CSeries aircraft or offered current information about whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitional plan to start commercial operation from September.
After the starting aeroplane, about a month ago and a half aeroplane was only three times flying, and there was a question of whether the test phase works well.
The results did not fill the estimates and the bourgeois action in Toronto decreased by 8 percent.
Analysis of the State Bank Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from "heighter worth" to "sektor" on Thursday, expecting the storm to enjoy an amazing growth during the next fourth or two years.
"When we expected the most smaller aeroplanes, we were very disappointed by the winning breakdown in transport," Doerksen said in the customer report.
With the way the experimental program will continue, we believe that Bombardier will get new CSeries airlines.
However, in the next months, no new negotiations have been reported, we assume that the creation of the market is growing towards this programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that CSeries' flights are lost into the bottom market that now dominate Boeing and Airbus.
The experimental aircraft was discovered in March and after a few months late in September, the first year was taken.
However, the beginning of the compulsory CSeries airlines reaches modesty 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the experimental airplane to verify the company’s claims relating to low deficiency and support on the costs of this transport aircraft.
Currently, 403 negotiations and obligations from 15 customers and operators are in total.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that by introducing the first aircraft to commercial use, Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 committees.
The leading workers also assured the analysis and media on Thursday that the programme was acting in accordance with the plan.
“The experimental aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected,” said Beaudoin in the Conference Chapter and noted that re-examination on the ground and software updates were planned during the delay of the airport.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to resolve the first year and then to focus on update, and we did that.
This will happen during the whole plane.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five aircraft tests should take place in the next weeks and the final failure afterwards.
However, the analysers are skeptic about that the first client could start operating the CSeries aircraft for 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that she has evaluated its plan of transmission of aircraft and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow time of aeroplane – although it is in accordance with Bombardier’s internal plan – will obviously strengthen our opinion that the introduction to the operation will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
From 172 million USDs or 9 cents for one action in the previous year, in the third quarter of September, the pure winning of Bombardier on 147 million USDs, or 8 cents on one action.
The fixed expenditure for one action remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Rotation marginally decreased from 4.2 billion USD to 4.1 billion USD.
According to the IBES system, the IBES company, the analysis expected 10 cents to one action, and the investment of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer noted that 57 aircrafts per year before only added 45 flights during the fourth year.
The pure claims fall from 83 airports to 26.
Incomplete prohibitions in the airport division constituted 32.9 billion to 30 September, which do not change to 31th.
"The results of the airport were in accordance with our views, but the low receipt of the negotiations and the total market status disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The billion in the airport industry decreased by 13 percent per 2 billion USD.
Bomberdier, the biggest steel manufacturer in the world, pointed out that the performance in this division increased by 11 percent by 2.5 billion USD.
Incomplete prohibitions in the transport were made up to 30 September, 32.6 billion, which is more than 31 billion marginal growth.
Requirement in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The leaders have noted that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Action of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of the financial manager of Google Patrick Pichette, decreased during the marketing on Thursday afternoon by 8.5 percent of the value of 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced the ten percent fall in the fourth profit on Thursday.
Cocaine, which warned mafian from police investigation, is in practice
Basharat Ditta (42) had to provide information to the King's sublime to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug dependence would come out.
The Liverpool Coronary Court condemned him for three years of negotiation.
The pigs, who informed the drug mafian about a large police investigation, because fearing that his drug dependency would be revealed, was condemned for three years of transition.
Basharat Ditta (42) had been suspicious of the use of cocaine to provide a sensitive information to Neila Scarbrough’s highlight head on investigation of its activities on drug feeding.
The lawyer, whose survival was “Bash” (Parts) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative, was arrested at home in 2011 after the police investigation of Scarborough, which was represented in previous drug management.
The police looked at Sarborough (32), as he left in a lawyer house in Blackburn in La Papashire, who was just at dinner with his colleagues from the Rights Society, three pieces of cocaine.
On the basis of the tests in which cocaine traces were found in his hair, on his money and credit cards, the investigation showed that ditta was a regular drug operator of class A.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to get information about the arrest of two men in the benefits of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were at that time monitored in a large survey of heroin and cocaine trading in the Laıashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Following the detention of heroin and cocaïne in a range of policies, about 1.5 million GBPs and 200 000 GBPs were completed together with them.
Ditta (42) submitted information to criminals because of fear of its dependence on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works in Forbes Solicitors with a seat in Blackburn, lived a moment before the Liverpool coronary court, when he was considered guilty in two cases after three weeks of computing.
During the previous hearing, he was admitted to cocaine.
The deal of the fall occurred after the police investigation of Scarborough found that he was in the regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detective suspicious followed, mentioned his arrival to Ditt's house and saw him putting the drugs with 60 per cent of the lawyers under the crash in the black golf hand.
The next was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The crack returned home where he found drugs, and there were nine talks between both people.
In the court, it stated that the tracks of the drugs of class A were found in its hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was the “regular” cocaine.
Ditta was lately arrested, but the use of cocaine was depressed, and he said that he spoke with a suspicious dealer because he was his client, and argumented that their conversation was falling into “confidential communication”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his money and tried to get out of her a few credit cards, but all were arrested and his hair samples were cut off.
At the police hearing, he said that he was operating the office at his home address, both at the workplace, and that customers visited him at home because of the business.
However, the Court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supplier chain, some of which had previously represented to inform them of what they were detective.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "Who else is more than to violate the law than legal representatives in the criminal law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of disuse of his legal representative's position and that he has reached too close contact with a particular client.
It's not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who resources his own lawyer to drugs.
Some of his conversations were absolutely legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the border of the running relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation married how much he could to allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring a good news to his profession, but he's disappointed it.
He was too close to some of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed it to be cancelled by his independence.
It rejected the offence and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer I am not, and I would like to send information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
However, after hearing, the police inspector Lee Halstead from La Papashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal in the moment when he began to get drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependency on cocaine was unnaturally weak and vulnerable to the purposes of the former representatives of the organized crime groups, which gave him the task to broadcast valuable information on police investigation.
Representatives must keep the highest principles of integrity and have to excite their confidence in the public and feeling that they can be able to relieve them.
Mr. Ditta delivered this confidence and tried to hide behind his profession.
An entity for serious and organized criminal acts in La Papashire has led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, which has also been condemned for three cases of cocaine disorder and now for the protection of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring a criminal before the court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that there is no one outside the hands of the law.
We'll find you and put you in front of our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after it was announced by the guilty of association with heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
The additional thirty-five persons involved in the trade were totally imprisoned for 153 years for drug abuse.
On his website, Ditta organized a online conversation, in which he said that his dreamed work would be right to represent customers from the block of death complete in America, as a host at dinner would like Mohammed Aliho and as a motivation for work.
He negotiated about the government with Klaus and Spidlo.
Now the people of Jana Kasala have sent against Daddy.
People have received fourteen in the elections, so only a third number of social democrates or representatives of the United Nations.
The Government's negotiations, but they are at least one of the advantages.
In a team that has already started to determine the potential coal, Jana Kasala - a man who has shiped for humans undermines of government in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The social democracy or Andrej Babiš have no such math on their sides.
It would like to be this time in the first negotiation in 1992 when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experiences were at that time minimal," Kasal recalls how annual discussions will be developed.
Kenya printed by the contradiction of media law
"It is a terrible report and it is at the place to ask the threats of Parliament to simply not put the independence of the justice tomorrow," reported the newspapers that consider the law as an anti-republication.
"This law is cruel and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, which belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most recognised independent audience stations and reporting websites.
He said that the new Media Court “will be precluded because it is extended by the government’s hand and that restrictions on the scope and advertising will damage the position of Kenya in the world economy.
"I hope that the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this law and return it to the sentence," he said.
According to Star’s journal, the actual law to the Government is “complete control over media” and the Standard newspaper notes that democracy and freedom of manifestation in Kenya“sucked by firmness” and criticizes our law as “delicate”.
The approval of the law comes to a series of measures to strengthen national security without a severe attack of the Islamic shooter in the Westgate purchasing center.
The wrath of the offices on herself turned the Kenya media when she enhanced the record of the security camera on which the soldiers sent to an attack place seemed to have the trade with luxury goods.
The police manager reacted so that he allowed two journalists and the leader media work to hear, but the call was downloaded after the media pressure.
According to the new legislation, media companies may be repeated up to 20 million kinesian shillings and individual journalists to one million together with the risk of "combination from the list" or may be revoked by the official newspaper credit.
The Court also has the right to enter the property of the pachant if the repentance is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is also one repentance enough to eliminate the number of voting stations”.
It is also noted that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what the Kenya "live blogosphere" is called.
The politicians think that when they quiet the media, they can do what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the journalist of Nation Mutum Mathiu and described the Chinese media as a key source of the system of mutual control and performance in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, the country will bring us back to the bankroot and bring us back to jail and collection," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya were in the past in the public's criticism.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the ships established by the National Recompense Agency and for the restoration of their dust payments about 532 000 non-designed shillings in the month, which are so covered by the world's highest.
It's got to cover, you young Czech.
Most of them, but not even with any rates
More of the Czechs gives money on the side.
Yet, they don't reach champions in the disorder in the region.
More money are the Rakushane who will decrease in the average of EUR 181 monthly.
Something more than Czech, people in Slovenia.
It comes from the Erste Savings Barometer Group's research in the Middle and East European countries.
It has also shown that it improves the shipholders, and two thirds of the questioned plan to give more money to the side.
While Czech is nearly a wheat of shipholders, human consumption products in Romania and Serbia continue to use very little.
For example, each other Serb will, according to the investigation, break the house under the pool.
In the foreign year, there is a number of people who will decrease the higher amounts monthly.
Moreover, each month, thousands to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents were declined to the most different types of complication, and this year it was five percent more.
The average monthly post in the interannual comparison, but quietly declined to the 2078 coron.
The biggest hit between coincidence products is pension insurance.
This prejudices 54 per cent of the Czech, while three years ago it was the most preferred way to evaluate the level of support only for 36 per cent of people.
In contrast, building distortions are reduced, and other than the past year, investment funds have also been extremely interested.
You're using only 16 percent of respondents, while loni was just a quarter of people.
The investigation also showed that although people consider to be important to cover, most of them don't know what expenditure they achieve for individual products.
Young people are over 30 years old and don't know how their money is costed.
In contrast, the best information about the importance of their money stored has the oldest group of questioned, among people over fifty years, knows that it is the percentage of the questioned.
In the international comparison of Erste Czech group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and Rassed with a 12% degree.
The United Nations celebrates new objectives of fighting poverty
The United Nations Organization starts to work without adequately on a new file of targets replaced by the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which have been introduced 12 years ago after organizing the worldwide poverty.
Before the summary of the United Nations on sustainable development that started by night in Riu de Janeir, the Australian diplomatic played a key role in the implementation of “sustainable development goals” that will replace MDGs which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard during the summit.
The UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun on the summit said that it is now time to "release over national interests".
"I am glad that the Member States agreed to launch and adopt a process to set up the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will draw up the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an increasing part of the development programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our views on the objectives of sustainable development, which will bring to the success of MDG.
The security concerns of Mosambique are part of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the soch of Samora Machely, the Mosambique Funder president, thousands of people in the centre of Maputa were gathered to produce peaceful passwords on rare public demonstrations.
"We want peace; we want stability," Vanessa de Sousa, the Executive Director of the Investment Society.
With fear of the future of its country, the business clothing was changed by a trick "we require security" in Portuguese and joined it on Thursday to the Country of independence in the main city.
Two weeks later, the reports on the daily conflicts between the Governing forces and the Renama have been reported, one of the worst steps from the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was sometimes an ungrately known rebellious movement, supported by the Belarus government in Rhodesia and then by the government of the apartheid in South Africa in the efforts to destabilise independent governments of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analytics are convinced that it is unlikely that the country re-interrupted conflicts will be re-interrupted, but recent events have caused re-investment and local events.
There is a growing economy because the findings of large coastal reserves and coal stocks on the northwest can be brought from the company, such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko, investments in more than 50 billion dollars.
The Governing Party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and the Renamo are accused of the emergency pressure.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has caused recent conflicts by taking an attack on their members in the region of Sofala, the traditional village of the Party of Renamo, on 17 September.
The violent attacks of former rebellious rebelliouses succeeded when government forces attacked the foundation of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times speaker of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government's accused of running the Renamo conflicts because it seemed to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuz tried to disturb instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP in the middle said that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "stroskotance" who wanted to use "what was left of his power to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government."
Like Frelima, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased when Mr. Mazangy's words were quoted that Renamo is declining from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT's letter said that he meaning that the Frelimo party doesn't respect the agreement anymore.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between these parties have made the pressure between these parties, breathed a number of runs in this year, just a little.
It's a scarlet between two big persons (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said a lector at the University of Opened and a Professor of Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator and no one of them is ready to perform the necessary procedures.
Renamo, who was seeking election changes, already expressed that she would boycott the communal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.
Some comments interpreted the use of power as an attempt to coherent movement to get from the Government of advantage and financial challenges.
The election share of the Renamo has been decreased since 1992 while the newer part, the Democratic Motion of Mosambique (DHM), which was established by the former member of Renamo, as expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, whose next year ends the second employment period, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"The democratic system does not want more parties, does not want transparency elections, does not want peace, because it does not want the presidential office to leave," said Mazanga.
It's unexpected what Renamo's options has, but he has committed a divergence of terrorist attacks on the police station and on the key road between north and south.
In the province of Sofala, which is about 100 km away from Maputo's main city, but where Beira's city is, the campaigns, including Rio Tinto and Vale, in their exports of carbon.
In June, Rio stopped the use of the railway for a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to express the question if Renama was again in danger.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the non-goodness in Mosambique" said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent Mediacoop medium society, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent income.
"The people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is exclusively the government and the president and that he must be the one who finds the solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo, nor Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for life’s way,” says the author.
The stories about Thor can show that “the cruel force cannot be equal to smart lsticity” while the artus legends discover how important it is to have dream.
The majority of myths would "be too scandal to learn at school, and in some cases too scandal," Crossley-Holland said, "which is at the time of a careful choice, was too scandal and in some cases too obscene."
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I played this plan for twenty years.
He added that the authors and the teachers are “internally teaching” in the story with the “support” message for children as“switching”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated epos Beowulf from English and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Bourses, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will make it better if you leave them for yourself."
The biggest difference between adult writers for adults and adults writers for children is needed for a feeling of children.
Not whether everything must be simplified or finished by happyend, but there must be a natural sense for good and evil.
And it must be a subconscious; discovered by the story, never indirectly defined.
It's the truth about that it's better to show than to describe.
The Branch Star will take visits to the universe in a new digit
In the first view, it is obvious that the big planetary sal has changed in the last half of the year.
There is a new board here, visitors can be broken into new pleasant seats and the project area has reached over their heads about 17 meters in the face of a cup of the American company Spitz.
At the salon is his most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To be the image perfect, there are further smaller projects in the salon.
The next important part of the whole equipment is hidden behind the walls of the room.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Branch Star Yuri Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image of some projectors doesn't cover it, but gives a complete intention.
"The computer cycle is thirty-to-40 times higher than in classic personal computers," the technology from the stars Tomas Hladik.
The Digitary can test extraordinaryly realistic and plastick model of night clouds, human body or the ocean.
Wonders are so obscure directly to the universe or human brain.
Other similar equipment are nearest in Varsovia or Hamburg.
The leading of the stars plans in the room to avoid the purchased orders and its own creation.
From Saturday, they're on two orders.
The name is Astronaut and is designed for adults.
People in it will learn about the cosmonaut trends, fly into the universe, get to the centralisation, and then on the views they will see how astronauts are in the cosmos.
The second order is for the kids, and he's the name of the Kousel Beast - Kaluoka'hina.
It explains the story of the beauty that pestrobars lived in a quiet life until the time when the explosion of a nearly near-term explosion occurred.
The whole digitary was about fifty million crowns, paying overall the Ministry of School.
A smaller amount also contributed to the city of Brno and the star gift from its budget.
The project area was 10 million crowns, a projector of 12 million.
"The rest of the audiovisual technology and computers" explained Dushek.
The digitary installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the star had passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visits could be reached by the end of the year.
We've been awakening 11 thousand INZERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November of the remote year, the analysis catched over 11 thousand insects in place, from which 4300 were published in daily printing and 6800 insects (62 per cent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore the most important media for the publication of employment offers.
In 2005, when the investigation was first conducted, its share was 26 per cent.
In the last two studies (2007, 2010) it has reached approximately 60 per cent.
The indicator of work options in itself, according to an analysis, reflects a significant measure of the current job market.
For example, a simple comparison of the number of public investors during the economic prosperity and during the economic crisis can be made.
For example, in 2007, 25 900 insects were published in the same period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of job positions on the Internet is oriented on a better, especially on a more-professional group.
In contrast, the offer of employment in daily pressure covers a wide range of professionals, introducing the author’s analysis of Paul Satisstn.
The measure of representation of the selected professional groups is different at both media.
On the Internet, the main places of insectivity searching for managers and leader work, business representatives, programming and financial experts have been published.
The position of developers or leaders of small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the daily printing, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, but the large representation is, in particular, official and professional professionals.
The most frequently specified requests that employees express insurance offers include, of course, education.
The next followed was the knowledge of other languages, especially English.
In the daily print, the request for the knowledge of the foreign language was indicated in three percent of the insects, on the Internet in 37 per cent.
Only two percent of employees requested active knowledge of two other languages.
The 'computing rate' demands appeared in 40 per cent of the inserates (in daily printing in 11 per cent, on the Internet in 57 per cent).
The practice was requested in 54 percent of the insects.
Practice requirements are universally linked to professionals.
It is particularly the leader production and the other leader work.
In particular, business professionals relate to mechanisms and tools or manufacturers and manufacturers of food products or electrical devices, the author of the study of Jiří Tillner.
The employees also in the half of their insects refer to the requests for the properties and capacities of eventual candidates.
As the most frequently requested powers, the communications powers are already shown at the first place in the insertion.
Other employees require flexibility, adaptability and dynamic, identity, responsibility, organizational skills and cohesion.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Years of the Newyor Festival of Comedie: New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York was a place where only comic exhibition was born in America: a hundred years ago, a different artist of Frank Fray, who worked as the president of the offices in the Palace Theatre divadle in Broadway, began to tell the conserved people about the method of talk.
Fay's innovation has increased during the years, the latest in the newyor festival of comedy.
The Festival based and managed Caroline Hirscho, the founding institution of the single comedie Carolines, celebrates its tenth year – together with more than sixty representations in small clubs and big divorces.
"The majority of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful in the measure that they were too big than to play in the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
Annual event includes Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffins and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes” (to be held for heroes), an annual musical output in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has spread, the world has spread the comication.
Several comics have come from non-radical channels, such as shows in smaller audience or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has been stuck with his sick (weave "League" to the fantastic football team at FXX) and now has his own comedial show at Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of the program “Saturday night live” and “Parks and recreation” but mostly glorified the broad series of videos “Marcel the shell with shoes on” (move Marcel in boats).
Like Kroll, Slatea, as well as other young comic with divorced voices (really pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, an amazing, racially affected W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralised world of the American Comedia.
One of the biggest festivals will be a conversation: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a single comic, but he became a successful TV and movie recorder, like an unofficial comedian history.
Since 2005 to 2007, he was on TV Land show called “Sit down comedy with David Steinberg”.
Meeting at Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the Comedial DNA of Larry's whole work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he's going through the street between two buildings and he says, man, if I come for all the money, I may live here.
The roof price continued to fall on $96 per bar
The growth price on Friday continued to decrease the fact that the concerns of high resources exported a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese honey production sector for energy.
The American farm indicator for supplies during the latest of the European electronic trade decreased 14 cents to $96.24 per bar.
On Thursday, 39 cents were decreased and 5.8 percent remained for October.
Rich resources in the past weeks were charged with the price.
The Central Energy Ministry stated that the American resources have increased by 4.1 million bars last week.
In five weeks, the resources increased by more than 25 million bars.
On Friday, however, the two reports on Chinese production came to a higher requester that showed the growth in activity.
This indicates that the economic refusal of China could continue to increase in the third quarter by 7.8 per cent in the past two weak decades.
Ropa Brent, the indicator for the international rope, also used by the American raffinery, fell on the International Trade Burge in London at 26 cents at $108,58 per bar.
No, Mr. Hashka.
We have a unique opportunity to show politics that it is not the way.
It is necessary to develop a pressure that Martin Hashek should be released from all the political forces and leave the deputy mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture that is so mixed.
Martin Hashek is in harmony with the promise that he gave, but everyone and politics must be particularly the investigators of that promise and consider very much what it can promise.
Confidentiality is the only one that has the policy (Mr. Babiš has the mass, but it is the question of whether they are politics).
The first program that is prosecuted by a liar is incredible.
It's in politics, it's in politics.
Mr. Hashku, if you think that is good with this country (and your honest statement confirms me in it, if you just missed - here you see how it's complicated, you'll leave the policy yourself as a man.
Then your excuse will be accepted as a proud man who made a mistake and carry his responsibility for her.
In the contrary, you will be considered as without weaknesses, in which you cannot believe in words or acts.
Or you want to be a proud, a missing man or a life-scate.
Maybe you seem to be unjust when I praise you only, but you are a leader, and they are only a misguided sheep.
And you're a leader and you wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to shoot your ears now, overground the powers, sit down this deceit and then attack again, but so you're partised or appealed.
You, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the Alpha Same, do so.
Take your responsibility and get out of the policy.
The Court has locked the regulation on the procedure of delay and investigation of persons by the police division in NY
The Federal Revocation Court blocked Thursday a Court Regulation requesting amendments to the detention and investigation programme in the police office in New York and revoked the case by the Court.
The Second American Federal Revocation Court said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be revoked to the revocation decision given by the city.
In August, the Judge decided that the city violated the Constitution so that it implemented its programme for delaying and questioning people.
The town of its conclusions and its right regulation was appealed, inter alia, to assign a monitoring that would help the police office to change its procedures and its school programme connected to them.
The Revocation Court heard the arguments for the requested derogation on Wednesday.
The Court of Auditors said that the judge should be revoked from the case because it had been in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, and that, as a judge did not agree in accordance with the requirement of avoiding the opinion of undertaking, partly because of a series of discussions with the media and public declaration that she reacted intermediately to the criticism of the court.
The Court decided that the police officers violated civil rights of tens of people when they wrongly addressed the black and his ́nce in their detention and investigation programme.
She established an independent monitoring to monitor the main changes in the reform of procedures, training and monitoring, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme to test the cameras on the body in some areas where the most frequently stops persons.
In August, the city of New York agreed to finish the storage method of names and address of people whose cases were refused after police investigation.
The oral decline of the city is sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
A number of civil rights protectors have criticized the stoping and investigation tactics.
In some form, there is a decades of stoping and searching of persons, but mentioned views under the administration of the independent age of Michael Bloomberg were dramatically growing to the record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases about blackness and Hisskýnce.
In 2004, four men who belonged to the minority, a complaint that became the case of the group's complaint.
The remaining amendments to the programme for delay and investigation of persons conducted by the police division in NY state that changes will end unfair practices, increase the confidence and effectiveness of the police congregation and may affect how these procedures are used by other police divisions.
The opposers claim that changes reduce the police moral, but not crime, and that they lose money, but that does not solve a wide problem when the police congregation is under pressure after the last decade has decreased its number of thousands of people.
The Court noted that she did not finish the practice of stoping and investigating persons that were constituent but reformed the way that the Police Department had conducted in NY.
Five purchasing centres are covered with low visit
This results from data from real advisory companies of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague divinities, the Business Centre of Krakov is opened and will be the 19th Prague purchasing center.
Now there are 90 large business centers.
Unsatisfiable performance is about 20 percent of large and large centers.
Clause problems are inadequately a large center against locality and bad layouts, so too much father or complicated and invisible passport management, if possible dead centres," Michal Sotak said from Cushman & Wakefield.
According to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, the leading division of small trade injustices is likely to deal with a low visit by about five business centers.
In the main part, it includes bad transport availability, low income category of local residents or market accuracy at that place.
Some projects opened completely, but their results were mainly insatisfactory at the beginning.
Today, customers are sometimes to preserve and do not change their purchases.
The new business centre must be more trying to "slave" its customers on new marks on the market, entertainment, services and marketing actions," added Samadi.
The acquisition centres are generally stability, even in some centers, because the purchasers were willing to flee from a recompense and to continue with some units.
"But it is true that some projects that are not completely occupied and the median obsession are so decreased (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouci), added Sotak.
Commercial centres in the past two years are marketed very slowly according to Sylvia Samadi.
The marketplace for new projects, but there is.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
On the market, there is a space for building smaller local projects called 'convinience centres', related to purchases and services of daily needs for residents living in an unfair environment," said Samadi.
According to Sotaka, there is also a place for further purchase centres on the foreign market.
And for the small 'service' center, so for large projects in Prague, or in the middle of large projects, or extension in regional cities.
"The cities like Kladno, Czech Republic, Brno or Plzne have space for further growth," added Sotak.
In Prague, it sees a space for the Prepared Trade Centre on the Victory Place, further by May, according to the potential of the street On Prikopa and Václava.
"Intensively, the expansion of detail parks that enables trademakers to cover and expansion to still smaller cities for profitable and operating costs, the space is also in some places for smaller local or local purchase centres, respectively their reconstruction, such as the restructuring of business houses Prior, which is weakening from good locality," added the DTZ Data Kubank.
In Czechland, 90 modern purchasing centers are currently located with over 2,2 million meters of quarter-screen floors.
The fourth of all these purchase centres is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest purchasing centres, by the number of employees whose nine are in Prague, results from Incoma GfK data.
In the number of purchase parks, the CR is under the EU, in comparison with the values of British and France, Czechland remains about 50 quarter meters per thousand of people.
Coulson got in the phone to check the guy.
The former news editor of the news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson fully used the methods of "coming into the phone, monitoring and confrontation" to confirm a subhydrated type of charity relationship in which the Minister inside Charles Clarke had to be involved.
The State Representative Andrew Edis at the court of Old Bailey said that the news of the World took false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen by his “atracti” special adviser Hannah Pa.
The news accounted for the private investigator Glenna Mulcaria to get into the Paıby's voice box and enter her privacy, but at the court, Coulson also called her and left her voice reports.
"The State Representative points out that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing before the house and hopeing that people will catch outside, but a person who is no longer condemning stories to see what they will say," Mr. Edis said.
He said that notW newspapers used three ways to explore stories: renting into the phone, monitoring and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, follow-up, he needs to do about it.
What's the first one?
Does he know about the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he certainly knows."
The girls about the lovely relationship in which Clarke is involved were first captured by the news reporting notW when the resources that were sexually interested in Mrs. Pa ́bya were said: "You're just losing time, it's with Charles."
The voting reports taken from her phone at at least three opportunities was obtained in Mulcair House in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator where Mrs. Paıby and her sister were marked as “Projects”.
During the time Mrs. Paıby was investigated, her parents received anonymous phones in which they were requested for information about Paıby, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, the former rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and the former rapporteur James Weatherup observed the follow-up of Mrs. Paıby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left the voice message in which he reported: “I have received the story we want to publish tomorrow and to talk to Charles very much about. ”
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the history was according to the same model as in other significant characteristics, including the former Minister of David Blu ́tt.
In the court on Thursday, Coulson confronted Mr. Blu ́tta because of the lovely relationship with the wife, while he himself saw Rebecca Brooks, who was then dedicated.
Coulson and Brooks have interacted with other persons after the phone rental during the period from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup were admitted to get to the phone.
The NSA discovery increases the Community monitoring paranoid by the State
On the end of August, a German police officer bought over the American Consulary Authority in Frankfurt, the main city of German economics.
For the Instructions of the State Agency for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Home Rapporteur Agency, it was the mission to prepare photographs of the spectrums of American guards located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbanks.
The German media claimed that the BfV Office had hoped to be able to identify the presence of the auditors' anthen, and this action had made a exchange of opinions between the American and German Minister in Berlin.
James ́pper, the American National Rapporteur Director, again held that the United States did not use their initial reporting options, "to steal the business secrets of business companies in the benefits of the American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit."
But since Edward Snowden, who has become informed from cooperation, has started to discover his valuable assembly from the secret monitoring of the United States, the European governments and the primary businesses now do not know whether they have the word of the director to believe.
After reporting that the United States National Security Agency has performed a spinage in the Brazilian farming company and has received access to data with which the American cloud providers are available by Google and Yahoo, has reached a general paranoia on the state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last cup came with discovering that the phone of Angely Merkel's office was probably listened to ten years.
It may be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are potentially potential and primary enterprises.
Snowden previewed the intensity of cooperation between American reporting services and companies.
I would say that these data are likely to be used for mutual advantage.
"German must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi company, representing the small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to the investigation issued in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that the United States now represents the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence that the United States have transmitted trade secrets to their own company in all documents revealed by Mr Snowden.
Policies expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain capacity in the IT and the Internet, and they noticed that it should try to limit its dependency to the United States:
The primary businessmen are the skeptics.
From the German Parliament, they voted that they had to produce German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly again...
It's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software company SAP.
Someone wanted a strong European IT industry to let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany gets touched from carbon to car and farmer.
Everything outside the IT industry.
The range and technology of the American Spain Agencies discovered by Snowden are for some companies who later believed that China was the biggest threat of follow-up, however, shocking.
It continues to be a large turnover in the cloud calculation technology, where European representatives have noticed that the data stored in the United States fall under dark jurisdiction, and therefore are potentially attackable.
According to the research carried out by the trade community Cloud Security Alliance, approximately 10 per cent of non-American members after discovering the US Data Prism refused to use a cloud supplier with a seat in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the General Directors of SAP, says: "We have the new question for customers that haven't been here a year ago - where are my data stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high factors argue that the last reports are only the confirmation of what they have already said: the powerful states want to discover their most valuable secrets and these data must be protected at all prices.
It's not a surprise that economic spinage is being conducted.
It's always been done.
"It is a fundamental subject for many years and this has not been significantly changed during the current debate," Kurt Bock, Agrochemical Director-General of the BASF.
The Americans conduct a spinner on us at business and industrial levels, as we do, because it is in our national interest to protect our business.
Undertaking leaders generally do not want to praise the anti-considerations that have acted in order to prevent attackers from providing the advantage.
In the case of big companies, it is already implied that to take free memory USB disk or leave an unsaved notebook in the hotel room is at least incomprehensible.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car representation, says that it has been a long time to collect the practice before the meeting of the mobile phone representation so that it is not possible to be used as auditors.
The German BfV Office advises the leader workers to consider whether to use simplely paid mobile phones for the risk that smart phones can be depreciated.
Prepayed mobile phones will be removed after.
However, there is fear that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hackership and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are in their specific main representatives of the global market.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect the enterprise secrets against unemployed access” warns in their BfV report.
The United States warns its own company against economic spinners from other countries.
According to the letter Washington post American documents National Intelligence Estimate introduced in February France near Russia and Israel in a second range of hackers who participate in the hacker activities for economic reporters, and soon in China.
The member of the Council of the German Free Society concluded that, as regards the economic spionage, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Rapporteur Agency, stated this month in one of the discussions: “The services are very well realized that, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, they perform a spionship in their associations.”
Parents of an unflying boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident, they don't want him to be killed
Parents of an unflying boy from Georgia, whose body was located inside the shadow of the feeding spirit in the body of his mid-school, failing to kill their son, the lawyer of the family said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, in Georgia, was found on 11 January in a balanced spirit behind the courts in the physically high school where he was walking.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in an incredible case, but the family of a 17-year-old youth refuses.
"They are uniquely convinced that their son was killed," for FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnsonvy, said.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff declared.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and healthy understanding," he said.
It seems that it is to be deceived by what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son’s death.
"As they used to send their son to school, and he returned to them in the question of the dead," he said.
The State Representative Michael Moore said on Thursday that Johnson's death investigation was conducted and noted that several key questions remained unresponsible.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a criminal investigation?
He announced Moore on the prints on Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna watch it anywhere.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis for running investigation," he said.
Moore reported to the journalists that the pitch indicated that Johnson died as a result of the "pool inspiration".
However, the second pitch, according to Moore, indicated another cause of death.
"There are a few questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death detects enough evidence for the order to investigate criminal offences or violation of civil rights, he requires the FBI and his execution.
The representative of the sheriff's office from the circuit of Lowndes was not available on Thursday for a case comment.
Judge of South Georgia in the middle of the offices ordered to provide all videos from the monitoring cameras that investigators have watched.
The parents of the youth hope that video records will include a track leading to discover how their son died.
Center CDC issued for the schools of a Directive on allergy in children
The Centre for Prevention and Control of illness (CDC) issued a file of guidelines to help in the case of children's allergies for food at school.
It is the first file of the directives issued by the US government, and this is because the number of children of schools suffering from food allergies.
One of the 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC Centre concluded that the result of food allergy in children was 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The Directives include information for schools about how the teacher congregation and staff to know about children's allergies on food and how to respond to allergic reactions, if it happens.
It also recommends to have adrenalin available – most often uses the automatic EpiPen tag injection – to be able to respond to potentially dangerous survival life.
State legal authorities have recently updated rules that enables schools to save adrenalin easier.
The report also contains the list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children with allergic reactions.
The child can say, "It's like someone's getting me into the language," "I feel that I'm in the language of Clupe" or "He testifies to me."
Parents of intersexual children may choose "unusual sex"
Germany became the first European nation, which recognises the third section in children born with an inequality sex.
Newborn kids have already been classified only to male or female sex.
The new law from parents does not require that they introduce any sex for such children and allow them to introduce sex as “unspecified” or “unspecified”.
The purpose of the law is to stop pressure on parents to make their child determined to operate sexually, and to fight discrimination against those intersexual.
A intersexual person according to BBC after many years said, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna stay a latinan doctor created, potential and discovered.
It is estimated that every year of 2000 children are born one that is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, parts of the group of approximately 60% which fall into the diagnosis of sexual development inflammation, deteriorating the termin for those having atypical chromohythms, genetic disorders (vaccines or varlates) or unusually developed genitality.
Intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
The definition of the sex is not yet completely comprehensive, but most of the experts in the United States say that if they can't specify the sex, it is better to use the best available information and to determine them, rather than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out, if all.
The New York psychiatric Dr. Jack Drescher, specialised on sex-determination problems, said that the new German law "seems a good thing".
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in life a threatening situation that requires operations, but most children are not so," he said.
The definition of the sex can be carried out without operation and then can wait for the development of identity.
Knowledge of how the child develops sexual responsibility is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why.
It's like a mystery why some people are homosexual.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not linked to sex, but to their biological building, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be defined as either of them.
These drawings can be displayed in secondary sex characteristics such as the volume of swallow, hair growth, puls and station, in primary sexual characteristics, such as multiplying organs and gender structures, or in the structure of chromoems and hormones.
This report also provides a review of discrimination which affects intersexual and transsexual people in the work, as well as a level of burden, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark in official documents of men, women or “third sex”.
In June, Norrie May-Welby, 52 years old Australia, became the first worldwide recognized "free" person when he won the court's revocation to keep the status of the "undetermined" sex until the end of the life.
According to the Ministry of Industry, German passengers will have other than M (man) and F (woman) and the third name, X, and this for intersexual persons.
In the neighbouring France, reporting to France, 24 problems are still contradictive.
In 2011, tens of French legislators from this strong Catholic country signed the fifth in order to remove “theory of gender”.
The American Catholic websites online also mixed the German law and wrote: “The way the world is invoked to the new state when the sex is a question of choice, but the sexual activity, even though, we convert two other pillars of civilization.”
One newborn mother from Maryland also said to Baby's area that she would like to see that she would be assigned to a child when she was born.
“The family alone is stressing, even without other restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex,” she expressed for the websites relating to parental care.
Children have stability and security.
Historys called children with a man like a female sex hermaphrodite, according to the visible Greek, which had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the doctoral community believed that the gender was something like a table that could be deleted and re-designed.
But now many do not doubt the ethical basis of the operation that sex responsibilities are complex matters, and the doctors may sometimes decide wrongly because they don't know how children will feel in view of their sex when they grow.
"In half the 20th century, it was called psychiatric preparation," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatric, but a chirurg.
The survival theory of how to treat children with an insignificant sex was submitted by Dr. John Money at the Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex is submissive.
He created a new concept of “society” and argued that social reasons and effects — as parents raised their child — affected children's genes and hormones and created a child without prejudice to whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became constant.
For the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of the bad circumcision, he recommended that they let their kids be completely astray, remove his worms and raised her as a girl.
"The Media presented this case as a successful case of change, but it was different," Drescher said.
When a 15-year-old boy, he left her back to the boy and married her wife.
However, in 38 years of age, he was suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "use this model" too.
But in the 90s, with the Internet arrival, the survival of these operations has been discovered by “inconsciousness with the outcome”.
It was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with men's chromosomes, but an insignificant sex with a structure.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “friendly life”.
So so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's chirurgics were removed by external organs and varlates and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was incredible, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to the plastic of the funeral at 18th.
But because he was depressed and thought something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one told me anything.
Bruce was born with a violation of sex development (DSD), which prohibited the body to produce a sufficient quantity of testosteron to be properly developed by its body.
After he learned the truth, he changed to the man, took the dose of testosteron and let him remove the puls,
Operations caused his unfruitfulness.
Today, it represents other in the organization called Interface Project and trys to normalize the view of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group of Advocates for informed choice (informed electors) with the seat in California, fears that the German law “invokes inquiry and stigmates”.
“Too many activists are afraid that the German law will achieve the encouragement of parents to make decisions and choose ‘neurity’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid that it's going to be an intervention.
We think it's better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law finally confesses, so everything we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian Law because “is allowing adults to choose to be included in the third section”.
“A adult should be able to act on the legally valid sex of its own decisions,” she said.
The German law wants to allocate it when he was born.
That's the battle that a little child wouldn't have to get up at this moment.
When they grow, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radio ladger from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a violation of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a supporting group, said that the German law will "do power" to parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with men's chromosomes, but DSD called an invisible syndrome of androgens.
Because her androgen recipients are valid, Katie's women's paintings developed.
He's got a vagina, but he has no worker and eggs.
Now the 29-year-old Katie is dedicated and in the study at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as a stagist in Child psychiatries.
Although she is unfruitful, she hopes that she will become a parent by adoption or replacement mother.
"The Law gives parents a certain space to not make their decision fast," Baratz said.
It gives them time to perform certain tests and meditate on it and gives them time before writing “man” or “woman”.
In this regard, it's all right – you grow up and love your child.
You've got a widow baby and you're happy about it.
You don't have to quick up with a operation that's not returnable.
"This provides the opportunity to participate in the decision and child and takes the ush that parents associate because they are not sure they do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he is more accused – and that is a great thing.
This gives children the right to make their own decisions.
The drinker pulled the whole house with the benzine: He threatened that he was undergoing it with his own family!
The pressure increased, the fear was decreased.
The man began to threaten that the whole house was understood.
Instead, all available police guards in the area, as well as the unit of young Boleslavi and the congregation of volunteers.

Report: The ambam's campaign thought to exchange Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest adviser of President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times letter, thought secretly to replace Vice-President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most important feelings of the unexpected 2012 campaign books from Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The magazine Times received a copy of the adjudicating book and reported on Thursday evening that the president's top co-operation organized at the end of 2011 the intensity of group meetings and research to consider whether the release of Bidena would help to resume Obama's rehabilitation.
According to the National Political Letter for Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a reasonable record of the efforts of the leaders in the campaign and in the White House, namely the former leader office of Bill Daley's White House, to measure what the elections should move the former ministerial office of Clinton to the post of the Vice-President.
The potential change was an extremely protected secret of the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Ova.
Only a few of the closest presidential advisers – including Daley, the former leader of Obama campaign of Jim Messina and former main advisers in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – said that this change was considered.
The book Double down states that Daley was an attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that until they finally decided not to overcome this step when the data showed that the addment of Clinton to the candidate would not increase significantly.
In the conversation with Martin Daley, he confirmed that she considered the administrative authority to replace Biden Clinton.
"I've intensely examined a number of things and this was one of them," he said for Daley's letter.
You should not forget that the president had a terrible view at that time, so we said, "Christian, what should we do?"
While Daley characterised the research as a "dependent care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that the renewable campaign had invested in great investment to make sure whether this would be paid in the elections.
"In campaigns, such money is not made for elections and qualitative research, if something is not seriously considered," Martin said in ↓360.
However, it is not sad whether Obama said that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin said to the CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss was on the basis of this potential cartridge.
While Daley said that he didn't think that the President had the potential changes to the "belief", the former leader office admitted that it was "possibly" that Obama had spoken about it.
Martin added that the book Double down definitively does not answer the question whether the political sondae has reached Obam's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama wasn't aware of the research about the exhibition of Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin answered.
Fantastic frozen that lights in darkness?
The British undertaking produced the first frozen that lights in darkness – for medus.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this sea animal and developed a lightweighting pam.
He came to the idea when he was reading a professional discussion on medush, and convinced the chineses to produce chemicals of protein that causes lighting.
This freezle reacts with the language of the consumer – increases the refrigeration of pH in protein and thus causes its sequences.
Chris says that the frozen lights when he reacts with the heat of your mouths, and so what you lie more, the more heavy.
Charlie, the founder of the frozen company "Lick me I'm delicious" (oil me, I'm awesome), says: "It's a substance, but in the case of production, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for 200 GBP."
The protein we use in the freezle reacts with your language in neutraal pH.
So as your mouth of protein is burning, the pH level is increased and the freezing starts to swallow.
We tested it in the past few months, and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic severe effect.
It's probably the most precious frozen I've ever produced because the lighting of medus is four times less than gold.
So I'm worth about 140 GBP.
But it's pretty funny.
Charlie's experimental company with the seat in Bristol is known for his non-traditional beer, syrers, beasts and gold letters.
His next product must be even ambitionary.
He says, "I would really want to make an invisible frozen."
It's not possible for the part of the light of the ice cristall that makes the frozen, but I'll calculate that we'll find a way to do it.
Frozen uses fluorescent properties of medus, artificially made by Chinese.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was small, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweetness, stay up and lead the neighbors to the overcast.
Today, I feel that I became anxiety.
Two years later, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year probably no other thing.
But they show that I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
According to the State Small Trade Federation (NRF) this year will celebrate Halloween’s importance of the Americans – in 158 million of them – and will lose a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, bones and beauty.
But every time about Halloween's pleasure, it's trends.
According to NRF, $6.9 billion is expected to go 1.2 billion per costume.
This year they're the last shooter of sexy unleavened objects.
Sexy must no longer be women; sexy can also be foods like pizza, hamburger and mrkev.
It's about a man, I'm hoping we'll see a lot of zombies by the dead, and I'm sure the worldwide men from Daft Punk will get this year into our channels in Instagram.
According to Google, they are the most searched zombies, Batman, pirates and birds.
I guess there's nothing wrong about it, walking according to tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs and we were not the only ones for my wonder.
The Americans, according to NRF, will lose 330 million dollars this year on the costume for animals.
So he'll see a lot of fun dogs.
It's sweetness, we're not working time.
According to Nilsen American company, $1.9 billion is lost.
It's about 300 million kg of Hershey table, lissing, milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's tissue.
This is a report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the United States Trade Minister, want to overcome our fourth.
We're buying during Halloween, and believe not and conscious, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is sugar bonbons, and yet, according to the National Association, they are sold around Halloween at least 16 thousand tons.
It's about 9 billion individual sugar bonbons.
That's a secret I've never heard.
Nothing for Halloween is more typical than a horrible house.
They have the best names such as "Terror behind the walls" (The House of shock) and "Ho-O-Scream".
There are in the United States officially dedicated 1200 horrible houses, which have 500 million dollars wins according to the company of the American terrible house, and that includes those increasing fears you are and gives your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person you like will see and add a comment as "beauty faces".
And finally, a little bit about the kidneys.
Since we were small, Charlie Brown presented us a big dina (Great Pumpkin) and cutting the dark lighter is something like breaking a Christmas tree – we do it from a little bit.
Fortunately, for us, the trend of the "child in the district" began thanks to Pinterest first, so most of us grew up on that we cut down, place and seated in it.
This year, according to the United States People's Computation Office, the United States will lose about $106 million for a district.
The lamp with mixing flames on your front veranda probably comes from Illinois, where this year has grown 245 thousand tonnes of dina.
Call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from the city of Napa in California and try to cut off their damn weighting at the same time one ton.

Drew Bowler, Technical Director Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants of the trains that join Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced leaders, but they are people who want excitement and kindness, and also a successful way to the world class’s trains.
We are sure that we can offer them this road in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format will offer a new way to live a different train discipline in Britain and the sea, and that it will prepare competitors for the strength and reality of Rally Raid's trains.
We actually enjoyed Defender Challenge's car rental – it will be a really exciting competition.
Moreover, in February, Defender Challenge offers school and test day and also the opportunity to competite in desert travels north Africa and Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have previous options here for two years
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting further preliminary options.
A week after the last in the conversation for Currently.ch said that there was no other east, and every government was sent by voting last Friday and the Sabbath is impossible blind.
"It can't keep it," Karel Schwarzenberg said with that the period of life of an early election period is estimated for two years.
With the feeling that the next electors will choose fully differently, they do not agree: "I think it's a little more exported decision."
In addition, President TOP 09 does not admit that its side could still lose electors as year in other elections (approximately 300 000 votes in 2010).
Schwarzenberg considers that if it had been within two months that they would have previous elections, it would be the United Nations movement of Andree Babische 2011.
In the opposite case, Schwarzenberg will lose Grandpa.
The Turbulentship in the CSSD, where President Bohuslav Saturday after the latched part of the leadership of the party, stated that he, or Michal Hashek, would remain in the leading of the social democracy:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as a little boy are going to the head of the state to allow them to turn back."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was more stupid and smart."
"Because I haven't seen something so stupidly done in my life," added TOP 09.
And in the direction of the President of Zeman (which he shot in the fight against the presidentship), he said: "The role of the State's head is: He wants to strengthen the side."
It has already submitted TOP 09.
What was the most surprised choice for you personally?
TOP 09 has already presented its first laws in Snevna formally, other than the Pharisean Register of Contracts, which had been discussed before elections by the committees, but with the preliminary elections falled under the table.
President TOP 09 in the discussion for Currently.cz claims that such a nature is given by "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to prejudice anxiety trials from other parts.
For example, the ANO Martin Komárek's electoral motion leader accused TOP 09 in a preferential battle because, by the idea of establishing the UN's UN's contracts' register "decreasing" movement programme.
TOP 09 now uses a shock - just retreated us, which had already been added to the second snippet reading.
Haszel units have come to save lost wheat, which has reached 15 meters above the earth on a dangerous exhibition in the stone
Ruby's coach was running for a little car accident.
In three days after the prisoner in the rock, a man who was thrown up the dog.
The Hassians went through the wall's scale to save the dog from certain death.
The wall was released by fire units that accepted it to be released after itself in a dangerous exhibition of 15 meters above the earth.
Ruby's nine-month cocktail fled after a small car rental on Sunday afternoon, and overlided himself three days until he was released in the middle of the rock.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) with their girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the rock of Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and salvation service from West Yorkshire.
After he fled when he reached a small accident, he was warmly watching their lost dogs and putting challenges on social networks.
In the middle of about 14,15, a fast-speaked whisper of Ruby's whisper looked at a rock of 15 meters above the earth.
Instead, the technical backing team from the fire station Cleckheaton was accelerated and went down to release Ruby, using his relief after the rock of the cart for animals.
The Professor of the Technical Saving Team Andyyton said: The dog was in danger.
It was directly at the wall scale – 15 meters from top and down.
When he was saved, he left his breast – he was completely frozen.
He's okay now.
Then he got the sugars.
It was a very unusual output.
It's incredible that a dog killed someone.
The Professor of the Technical Rescue Team Peter Lau said, "Ruby had great happiness during his run."
She was here to be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary at the watch, and other than the dehydration and dehydration was okay.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid by looking at a saved action."
Moreover, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was able to keep him back in the hand.
The veterinarian said he would probably fall if he was too exhausted and collapsed.
The Hassians took a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We're very grateful to them, all were just bitter.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there."
The Hassians were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that, Katy Perry's 18-year-old, he's not deceived.
During the interview of the Australian voting series, this pop star this week said that the song “Old habits die hard” of 2004 was a song of vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had a rock veteran with this rock dinner and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time, and now it's very nice to me."
In the declaration of the Jeiger's Thursday (70), the representative said that the category refused to do Katy Perry's way.
The Representative said, "It may be that you can beat him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest songs (singers) who had been found at the Rolling Stones Concert.
Her new Prism album debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Separated Europe gives Scotland a choice
Next day, another horrible story of independence.
This time it is warned that the submission to the membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This caused the stories of pass controls in Berwick and the wall of Hadrian.
It is true that Strathclyde's newspapers have mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as it was expected, it has not seen in news titles.
Nobody has also mentioned that the EU Member States have spent a lot of time by adapting their official laws if they say it to them.
Since Scotland is not now in Schengen, the proposal for continued irregularity for Brussels would be a loan for whatever they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Moreover, so old that it became a sepulchre, and the newspaper that " independence means pass controls", I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting idea is hidden in this youth speaker.
Why should it be expected that the independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why can you change Londres Chomout for that Brussels, especially now?
This is a European story: the great military plan to join Europe has finally been deployed.
The impact of the euro crisis is officially dead.
In addition, Europe will have the effect of the party's dedicated opposition to the EU or the revocation of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party alternativa for Germany – which was founded in this year – came as if it had already been used in the series of federal elections, but only five million votes from Bundestago, which were basically "reduced" of the Free Democracy (Equality of British Liberal Democrats).
On the home ground, it was an opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis became a determining moment.
The opposition dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the cross-based Kazakh, involving the national economy, and by a common currency, brought many people to the view that the project of Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro is only a little common with the fact that the national governments are economy with a high budgetary step – it was only true in the case of Greece.
Moreover, it is the euro system that blocks its members on the changes of German exporters' advantages – and German policies want to keep it.
Without the possibility of devastating household currency, southern Europe has a domestic production beyond German failure.
The only help is to cover income and public expenditure – to which Germany is encouraged.
As a result of current problems with the budget and the changes, the deepest cause of European small performance is.
As a result of the "Green" energy policy supported by Brussels — Code for the support of French and German fires on the costs of the consumer – European industrial applies two times more for electricity and four times more for gasine than that in the United States.
This is a paralyzing accident in the costs, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Neither any freezing of payments in the world would turn back to the dump of the European Petrochemic Industrie to the Left Bridge of the United States.
The result is a crucial rebellion, particularly in France, at the time of the EU's higher resistance.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany on trust and will enable Paris to set up at Washington level in the world.
Berlin, however, has already been a demonstration of political legitimacy and has condemned its own economic policy in Europe and has left his condemnation by the French economy.
Subject: The right wheel of Marine Le Penó, the Anti-European National Front, has just gained major additional choices and has removed the governing socialists to the third place.
The front is now with 24% of the most interesting part of France, which is a temporary warning for the britains that they cannot implie that the screening of the right will automatically be positively shown on the left.
How does Le Penna set up its new popularity among the white worker class?
European elections in the next year would be used to create an anti-European block against a common currency throughout the European Parliament.
The anti-European parties will say good in these elections, which is likely, that block may be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe that the anti-European feeling and standing against the common currency will be binding and the euro will be lost at the time of monitoring.
The EU does not disappear, but the change is more free in the meaning of "Europe (Suvereign Nations)" already predicted by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economy may leave the euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currency.
I hope that the Great Britain will remove from this project and reach the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington on the Pacific indicates that British will be left to Atlantic cold.
And where's Scotland?
We can choose to be a guardian (in principle) Small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – there is also the opportunity to inform Berlin and Brussels when we are allowed to be.
I guess Scotland would be a good way in the released organisation of Europe, as it would keep its own currency.
Cooperation with other equally thinking countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of the nations.
In the contrary, they had to take an example from Norway and maintain their economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is the most successful political movement in Europe, which has won great majority in 2011 thanks to the oppositional position against the ships planned (and implemented) the Ethiopian Officer Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservators and liberal democrats.
It would be fun if Scotland would now choose independence only for the adoption of susceptible measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Hour pubert: Earlier growing
The survey showed that African and Spanish have reached puberts before their white layer.
Physical changes do not mean that the pubert is near
Not demonstrated that there are hormones or other chemical substances
Experts claim that one of the launchers may be an obesity epidemic.
Trend's an early puberty is not so clear in boys.
The former reporter CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized for the health of children and family problems.
Should her mother be scared when her daughter grows the breast and the wheat in a seven or eight years old?
The American Children's Academy this week, in Orland, in Florida, explained the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these physical changes are relatively common between American girls and represents a new standard.
"I've spent a long time by assuring my parents that it is usually not a sign of development in the direction of the full puberty," said Kaplowitz
Visible characters of development, such as growth in the breast, insultation and undersight, are obtained in the girls before.
Nevertheless, in the last 40 years, it was only a small move in the first menstruation.
In the United States there is now an average of 12.5 years of extent of 12.75 years in 1970.
"When they are going to develop the breast, they will go for at least two to three years before the first menstruation comes," Caplowitz said, who is also author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Co.“ (Respected pubert in girls: Required manual for the control of this frequent problem)
The best test of how the pubert will continue is time.
It is discussed about the activity of the pubert start, but if the growth of the breast is raised by a growth question before the 8th year, the girl is considered “previous growth”.
In most cases, the process is slow or stopped – which children’s doctors can monitor carefully.
Increasing growth can be a d’evolution to endocrinolog perform tests for the elimination of serious problems, such as a cow or a cysta.
There are treatment procedures that lack time menstruation and prevent the following results: premature olderness of bones that can finally lead to the stop of growth and growth in adults.
Recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the child’s own, development, growth and emotional growth.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
This is about medication, Caplowitz is cautious, but it recognizes that “the pubert covering can satisfy the problems with the behaviour of a girl and its feelings that it is different from its kind of feedingstuffs”.
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to menstruate.
"They're afraid it can be pregnant or how to control hygiene," Caplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” says a woman whose daughter began to be menstruated in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came from the school home scared and angry that she was first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of the early puberty.
However, there is no related file of evidence that hormones are on the wine of milk or other foods, chemical substances in ® or sexual messages in media.
Boys – like girls – get puberts earlier.
Caplowitz promotes the presence that the most important deal is obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to study girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which connects the body tube with the puberty time.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African and Spanish have the ability to reach puberts before their white protests.
Explains are different.
Globally, it seems that during time puberts are affected by all possible economic submissions throughout the air to the genes.
Next point: Although boys are already in the low weather, the trend towards the full flow of a time pubert is not as clear as in the girls.
Other doctors have added more complexity to this subject to the American Children’s association (AAP).
Actions and inflammation are even running in which and in which batolate.
"We must be careful about how we identify the puberty approach," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb Child Hospital in Morristown in New Jersey.
Parents should not weaken to get the instructions from their child’s doctor to talk to their child.
"It may mean the need to talk to the child before you assume," Caplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
The girls who developed earlier are assured that even if they were so early, this process is a part of life.
Only Konvalink's role in economics.
Does he have a new job?
Herdja Nadja Konvalink (62) appeared in the economic role, and it was very important.
Maybe a favorite Czech hero planned to change the profession and to make business in the economy?
Nadia Konvalink appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and weared a beer there.
I did it first in my life, and I just got it.
The boss even offered me to work for me and I could live with a drink.
But I refused to stay at what I'm doing to this day, in heritance," the Convalink's smile, who was a host of the twenty-year-year work of the Irish economy.
"I have a Irish beer and I'll get the Irish whiskey here," she made her silly hero.
Nadi, a long-term friend and colleague Paul News, also appeared in the action.
I'm after death, and I'm not able to cry in the current new life.
I have allowed one beer or one beer every day, and I'm trying to keep it," added heric.
Aeroplane operators seeking the width of the seat, in the cave are big prohibitions
Among the leaders of the aircraft, a lot of seats in the second class was burned in a long distance of the aircraft, which this month caused the bitter exchange of views on the airport show in Dubai.
The width of the seats provided for in the remote aircraft for the economic class – not just that which the aircraft companies would usually prefer, but its assigned space is the key to orders for effectiveness in the last aircrafts offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus invited the industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm a wide seat in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that it has to decide about this.
It was established in the time when the aircraft producers competite in the sale of the largest version of their two-motor remote aircraft with the potential record number of claims expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way the back part of the aircraft is distributed – particularly if it is 9 or 10 seats around it – is the basis for economic performance charges on the new “mini-jumbo” airports.
Boeing says that the improved model “777X” will transport 406 people in economic seats with a wide range of more than 43 cm of 10 in each order.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of the wide economic seats set after 9.
Aeroplanes are often attacked in technical issues by publicity in professional media.
Airbus now before a airport show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X gets overwhelmed with more than 100 negotiations, calls directly for public.
Recently, he showed what could be by starting a new advertising war when he showed the financial people a picture showing three persons in the restaurant with the title "Let you like it?"
"Boeing promotes remote flights in seats more enjoyable than in regional tourist airlines," said Airbus John Leahy's leader sales.
As food habits change, people are more sensitive, but the seat in the aircraft hasn't changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 70th century, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern distant air transport, the weight of the US Medical American in 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the data of the United States Health Ministry.
According to American health, the average American is in the 21th century in the pass of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival holds a 50-year seat concept when the average width of the newly baptized airplane was lower.
Airbus claims that it has conducted a research that indicates that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the sleep quality by 53%.
The Boeing sizes of Airbus seats refused and said that it was not able to decide the way the aircraft companies export taxes and equipment.
The company also states that research shows that the cabin survival depends on more matters than only on the width of the seat.
"It is really about providing flexibility to the aircraft company and allowing them to do things that are convinced that they have to do so to succeed," said the expert on the Kent-ver cabin area.
They don't want, and they dictated them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For travellers is the main space for locks, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect the expenditure.
In this context, the aircraft with an estimated trade in the next decades, at least $700 billion at catalog prices, is sufficient to exhaust the eggs of American and European export.
As she said in July, the seat divorce is exactly what the fight between the last flights.
So as Airbus, Boeing states that they reach 20% better than the leader market representative in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The Boeing Executive Prosecutions are partly dependent on comparing the design of the model 777X with 10 seats in order and concept 777 with 9 seats in order.
The winning of unit costs is weak than the 10-seat concept.
"D’ Why Boeing does it is to raise more seeds and make his aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, leader of travellers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, the analyticals say that cabines with 10 seats in a series of existing models 777 are compatible with that many travellers are for a worst solution that can go in hand with lower taxes.
"Firty-five meters wide seat would be great for travellers, but the reality is that Airbus is motivated by the threat of the model 777," said the expert for the inner cabin Mary Kirby, the founder and the editor of the Portalway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't add a seat, but they offer a flying company a directory of suppliers to be able to choose.
Aeroplane sellers even carry a measured trailer with them to check competitive arrangements.
While I am grateful, all producers also offer aircraft with a high-speed planning for the low-country company and regional travellers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in order, but he says he hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus underlined the need for more cabin adjustments by offering a larger seat in the streets in some of its airplanes.
Experts say that without support of the other producer of large modern aircraft, the call to new industrial standards will remain unexpected, but it can be removed from the sale of 777X.
The beginning of HIV-reduced virus exceeded the thousands of people in Prague
In the Republic of Czech Republic, the number of catastrophes are growing annually.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later, 121 and 180 in 2010.
Loni was killed 212 and it was a record number.
"On the fact that the total number of newly reported cases over 200 years, I think it is no doubt," observed a expert on the AIDS Miroslav Havati problem, who has led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
According to the remote of January to September, 165 HIV patients in the country had 176.
The tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women from the beginning of follow-up to the end of the year-september, while most infected were in Prague.
Their level in September reached 1005.
In the Mediterranean, there were 206 infected residences.
The diagnosis was also heard of 156 people from the South Homosexual country, 130 from Mo’Scoslezski or 116 from Usteck.
The at least decayed coming from the Highness, they were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected in sex.
Fourteen people in the past have been prescribed in blood transfusion.
However, this case has not been discovered since the start of the test, so over the fourth century, in the CR.
With HIV virus, six children were also born, and they were transferred from their mother.
Injuries in the Gravity movie are, but looking is beautiful, strong experts.
The fantastic film from the Universe Gravitatation was sold in Czech cinema.
In October, it was seen by film distributors, according to the Union, at least 150 thousand birds and made more than 26 million crowns.
The majority of the reviews value the video positively.
Others, however, find certain inequalities.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a series of astronomes and astrophics about how they liked the film and whether they saw the insights that occurred in the movie.
Jiří Dušek (Director of Starsdare and Planetarium Brno): I have the fantastic films that I consider modern, dreams.
The Gravity Film doesn't take away, even though it is like a "fisically real" representation.
No, but it doesn't mean it would be bad.
I enjoyed him too much.
You can take note of the hair of Sandry Bullock, which doesn't know anyway in the state of unfortunateness.
Hubb’s space remote view and the International Cosmic stations are moved in extremely distant roads, so they cannot be seen in one collection.
Some film distractions calculate an unreasonable effect and all the behavior of the fire in the state of unfortunateness.
Scafandras would also not be held in such a way.
Herds in the Gravitatation movie often get into the colis with different objects and clothes without any more weight will keep everything.
The criticism wasn't protected, neither was the applet.
The so-scale tragedy on the current road of the Earth is, according to some debaters, unreasonable.
Moreover, she wonders why the doctor was sent to the universe to perform the technology.
People in the forests are also thinking of the "nereal" behavior of lan.
This seems to act as if it was intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Stars and Planetarium hl. Prague): I saw him on a wide scale, but I could simply say, I was obscured.
I'm not that it's not a documentary movie, but a science-fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (thereafter the obligation) to keep reality successfully.
"More than you mentioned inequalities, I have been touched by how a cosmic station is shown three times with degrading rate of technology (Chinese)."
"Chinese will finally be until the end of the decades and may be look better than in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Constitution of Academia ́d ČR): In computer-generated scenes, authors are not very successfully trying to violate physical laws, and so naturally oriented distress assesses that in different space wheels and wheels, the moment of liquidity, called the physics, is also a realistic view of the Earth from the universe, very tender atmosphere and the polyars, which are in the poland.
Inequalities will certainly be found in a detailed examination.
For example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of the different space waste on the current road appears to be rotated in some scenes before it should be in ability (from the west to the east).
Jür Stépán (Astronomical Constitution of Academia SCHR): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no principle and in heaven calling crime against logic or natural laws I have recorded in the movie, and in comparison with other films of similar incidence is to see that the creators have been interested in the advantage of the events shown.
From moments that don't give sense it is to mention the fact that Hubbl's universe's remote view covers other than ISS.
The investigation is very different and the salvation operation would therefore not be able to run as shown in the movie.
Then, at the moment of the Department of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) I did not not notice that the whole ISS would rotate, so there is no power that affects the Kowalskia that forces both actors to leave at the moment when they are not moving to themselves.
New vaccine against nikotin can take away the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nikotin, which can take away the pleasure from the roof of the cigarette.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for the whole life from dependence on nikotin.
Before testing on people, it is necessary to perform further tests that will take for a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the health faculty Weill Cor in New York says that the first signs are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy finally can help millions of kidneys who have tried to stop and deteriorate all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nikotin is so strong to overcome all the current approaches," said Professor Cor.
The new vaccine contains an insufficient virus that has been composed to carry out genetic information for the creation of anti-nicotine antibody.
The virus selectively affects the liver cells that will then repeat the gas flow of these anti-contrasts.
Protestants are tracking all nictine molecules in the crew of the Greek and neutralizing them before they get into the brain, which threatens the cow to get the nitrate.
In the tests of vaccinated mouse, added added nikotin, they continued in their current activity.
But the mouse that have not been vaccinated “speaked” said researchers, which is the sign that nikotin got into their brain.
The experiments are described in the magazine Science Translatation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anti-contracts.
The injections were to be given so often to maintain the sufficient level of opposite, so they appeared as dear and non-praktic.
The costs for the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert the liver cells to the manufacture of an anti-production.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccines for people are completely safe, they could be given to the kid before they have the pleasure of cigarettes to try, and that would be the way of dependency on nikotin.
However, many more likely they would use it to stop.
"They will say that when they start to smoke again, the nikotin vaccine will have no benefit from it, and that will help them to quit this crime," he said.
The britains said that the outcomes were interesting, but they warned that they needed another research.
Tripodi denys that Obeid would influence her.
The former Ministry of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Supervisory Committee for Corruption.
The former Minister for the New South Wales Joe Tripodi emphasized that he would change the coast payment policy on the request of his political deputy Eddie Obeida, who had the interests of three incapacities on the government controlled land.
On Friday, the independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) extended its attention to whether Mr. Obeid worked in a number of state ministers in order to purchase the Circular Quay, where Obeidovi owned two restaurants and coffee, renewed without having to participate in the selection procedure after it was released in August 2005.
The committee now examines the claim that Mr. Tripodi had been concerned about the interests of Mr Obeida on these incapacities, based on the evidence submitted on Thursday, the former representative of the leader office of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the Government pressed the public competition.
The beneficiaries were against it and also wanted more contractual submissions.
In 2009, the sales for companies in Circular Quay, which offered Obeid $2,5 million per year, were renewed without the need for public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister for Affairs from February 2006 to November 2009, was a public competition beneficiary.
But he emphasized that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeida, which, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, invoked to move in the governmental payment policy.
The ICAC talks showed the talks from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obed and Tripodim and Steve Dunnn, the leader of the Officer, who came to the resort of the staff after working under Mr. Obed in the fishing Division.
"After the discussions during these phone talks, the development of the policy of commercial premises?", asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what we've talked about, but, of course, not about this.
Absolutely not between me and Mr. Obed.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the goal in Syria, said the responsible factor
The Israeli military airports met on Thursday night target in the Syrian Lazikia port, confirmed the responsible administration factor of Fox News station.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what was the goal, but he said that he was at least one.
The pressing agency Press states that the target was the SA-125-Russian production rackets.
At least twice a year ago, Israel carried a flying attack on the delivery of rackets in Syria.
Many things moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commenter Pečinka spoke so that it could be agreed, where President Štech breathed.
Heytman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was chosen to the presidentship, and he confirmed it.
The Chairman of Saturday was, and he is the symbol of the CSSD battle continued.
Other gentlemen have preferred their weakness primarily.
Senator Servicebier is a principle and readable and unusable, the president of Zaoralek was most disappointed by television discussions.
On the basis of this, I don't see the better opportunity than the CSSD to be a Prime Minister for Senate Gaydòsk, the only one would not have a initial handicapped and I think it would take a standard performance.
It's so a good solution that somebody's on the lead will support him.
I add that this solution is the only option to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdòsk could without worry compose a minor government with only a blessing from the President of Baby and without humans, but with the Human Health Ministry of Hovorka, which is actually a social democracy.
This minimum government would have a great stability because it would promote the right reference law and thus committed to support the President of the Occamura Guideline.
President Grandpa would finally have made the tax progress, because he's fast and he'll see that it doesn't come without her.
People wouldn't have problems because Hovorka is the weaker of the best of their own, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the United Nations, and there would be a valuable minister, but if they are not reasonably wanted to enter into the risking government, but they would also be able to support it.
Let's get the courage of Alena Gaidovsko!
For the purposes of the work with visa authorisation may be subject to the 'authenticity' test
As the Government intends to expand the police plans, it considers the ‘authenticity’ test for the occupational work with visa authorisation 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied to the criteria to prevent that the programme 457 is used to fill out unemployment positions or as a back gate for the movement of the family and friends to Australia.
When a government debate was issued today, the former lawyer Maxine McKew judged the Governing Retoric on the jobs of initiative works with the words that it could cause Australian neighbors to be disappointed.
“Blessed statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australian’ are a very uncomfortable remain from the time when the unions requested a protected market work”, said the Australian-India Institute today.
History means that the white force work should be protected – and I would not be surprised if someone in this region mentioned the call of this historical artact.
The debate article addresses 12 measures considered earlier by the former Prime Minister for Chris Bowen.
Mr Brendan O'Connor, who was on Mr. Lance yesterday, where the officers were on the basis of the feeding of people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the final rest of the devotion.
The criteria of "authenticity" shall be adopted, and the applicants may be detailed to examine whether "the nomination is authorised by the candidate in relation to or with the owner or the relevant sponsoring company."
After previous experiences with enterprises intended to sponsor a small amount of jobs, but then hundreds of them were employed, it may also be required to decrease the number of holders of vision 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sir Lanka, who tried to azyl, died with a suspicion of infarct after this week reached azyl ship on Christmas Islands.
The nine - year - old man’s fearful son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death in the middle, he was comforted by an adult brother who was also on the ship.
The Australian offices and the husband moved to the hospital on Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government announced a study aiming to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2's work indicates that high-economy services for Scotland and North England will take place as soon as the first stage starts in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport of Baron Kramer said that the project "combines the British United Kingdom".
The Swedish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was cooperating with the British Government on this plan.
The stage will be consistent of a new high-speed stream line between London and West Midlands.
After the Phase finished, two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the Government overestimated the estimated costs for the building of high quality lines between London and North England from 32.7 billion GBP to 42.6 billion GBP.
The British Government, conducting conversations with the National Transport Office of Scotland, has granted HS2 to enhance further railability and the possibility of improving travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is a national network that better provides British and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that brings it is great.
Besides, we face the crisis in our rail network capacity.
However, it is also related to the connection – in addition to the Great Britain, HS2 will be better connected to 18 cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Swedish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "The present announcement is a good news for Scotland."
For the Scotch Government, Mr. Carmichael invited Mr. Keith Brown to support the Scotch accessories in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-economy trait has the potential of bringing Scotland indirect economic advantages, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the total case of high-economic railways throughout the United Kingdom."
We therefore cooperate with the British Government to examine the possibility of bringing high-economy railway to Scotland and thus bringing all benefits to Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scotch government is planning.
I am pleased to review the report on this study together with the British Ministry during the next year and to a joint decision on further steps.
Along with Barta, she arrested inspections and anti-corupt police analysis
Info about the arrest Welcome Barty began to spread on Thursday evening when you brought the message to the server PreRecurrence.cz.
MF DAYS of interests found that the case took care of the General Security Inspection (GIBS), its people had to arrest the Board in the centre of Prague.
It's been played before the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection resolves the cases in which the police are accused, however, its authority is also related to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, there is one of the arrested anti-coruption policies - leading analysis and information from Jan Petrželek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The anti-corupt police Jaroslav Ibehej, but refused to comment on information with the evidence that media must be turned right to GIBS in this matter.
Even her speaker inspection of Radka Sandor, but she didn't want to say anything, she rejected the City State Representativeship in Prague.
"This question we will not come to comment on the protection of the students," said the speaker's representative of Zenklava.
This increasing reaction can also lead to the fact that the event has been played, but it is in a mode of refreshment that does not allow the speakers to say anything specific.
Similarly, Bart's lawyer, Oldrich Chudob, is also in a similar existence.
The media said that the Bart represents "and in this thing", but because of the fact that it's about the accurate information, the Bart's arrest cannot confirm or revoke.
Some media earlier speculated that Bart's arrest could be linked to some police president Peter Lessy.
It was promoted to Bart just with the former President of VV Council John, who was sitting at the head of the Ministry of Inside.
The dispute that caused the extremeer Peter Nevertime and VV had to even resolve the president Václav Klaus at the time.
I don't know where this relationship has been taken to my person.
Nobody contacted me, I wasn't listening.
"I don't know anything about things really," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police boss.
Officially, even though Radek John, the real boss of the side, was just Bart.
The boat now candidated to the vote for the movement of Usvit, the lawyer mandate was only quickly avoided him - 175 votes.
The leader of Tomio Okamura said he doesn't know what it is.
"Keeping the Bart was one of many candidates on our candidate and as I repeatedly said before elections, he was not even a member of the Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamury," he distanced from the Barta Okamura, who said before the elections he gave Bart the space to candidate for Usvit because he helped him to solve the problem of executors.
Wit Bárta felt at the court in 2012 with his former collaborator with VV Jaroslav Scharka.
Regulations for the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft shall remain in Australia during the time of entry into force
The traveling Australian aircraft companies will still have to switch their tablets and smart phones during the starting and adding, and without prejudice to changes in the United States for the deterioration of the regulations on these equipment.
The American Federal Airport Management (FAA) has given the American company a space to change their procedures, so travellers will be able to read electronic books, monitor videos or play games during the critical phases of the flight if equipment remain in the "flight" mode.
The travelers can do this during the overall part of the flight, but many people are disappointing that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start and arrival.
The Australian transporters shall examine this decision, which requires a lot of work from the American operators to comply with those requests, but indicate that they are not planned to change their procedures at a quick time.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that he examined this notice, but emphasized that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in the critical phases of the aircraft are still in force in Australia.
“CASA has currently no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft,” he noted.
This question is covered by the rules required by the aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained for a long time and that passengers act in accordance with the safety guidelines obtained by the members of the property.
The Virgin company, who had already spoken with CASA about the extension of the use of its whistle wifi, has been changed, but has noted that the decision of the regulatory authority would be detailed.
"Happy if the CASA Office performed an analysis of authorisation to use electronic equipment because we really think that it would be now when we have (unscale palub entertainment) improved customers' lives," said the speaker.
The Qantas reported that it would keep the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment should not be used during the output and accession, and we do not intend to change it quickly," he said.
The FAA provisions relate to the American aircraft company.
But we are still interested in the development of regulations that can be useful for our travellers, and we certainly simplify the decisions of the FAA and d’as followed.
In the case of airport operators from the United States, the impact of regulations will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their airport park.
The operators will have to add that their aircraft can tolerate mobile phone movements, and to review manuals, school materials, manual liabilities programs and traveller information.
“When the aircraft firm confirms the tolerants of its football, it may allow the traveller to use transferable and easy electronic equipment, such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones in any overseas height”, stated the FAA.
In rare cases, low visibility of the facility orders travellers to disable during the arrival of the equipment.
The group also recommended that the difficult equipment be safely stored under the seat or in a place of head.
With a growing big middle class devote to blows in Singapore
In the bailing center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the golden boat, rings and shoes so that she can pay her daughters school.
"We and our husband just bought a house and gave all my money to it," Mrs Amirthalinga says.
Although each month as a administrator, it gets $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family income is not enough, says.
The request in the South East Asia – where household debt is increased – is in fact that ValueMax, where a woman carries its transaction, has become a third stop in the bourgeo in Singapore.
It is not just the way to stop the pupils – 1300 SGD in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is also so lonely as the unsafe bank.
Containers in Singapore are currently applying the annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, approximately 15,4 percent of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, the local bank with a rental in the same purchase centre.
However, the contractors have the advantage that they do not require a person's (payment history) or a receipt document and may provide a loan more than banks.
And thus, by feeling the pressure of families for increased life costs and growing debt for household and consumer debt, millions of people around the region are turning to stops.
After five years of potential growth from the global financial crisis and the loan loan supported by the financial policy in advanced economics, the family with low and medium-income turns to the stakeholders in order to organize a worrying financial activities.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's felt increasing the use of credit in households, especially because of the increased premiums as a risk factor for the creditability of the Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt of household in Asia.
Malaysia is on the head of a powder with 80 per cent of the BDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
The economics also feared the high levels of debt in Thailand, which just thus had been obtained from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, it showed continuous weak exports and weaknesses of consumer applications.
“It is important that the increased costs with people from the middle to the low [income rocks] will try to supplement their income wherever they are able,” said Song Seng Wun, the economy in Malaysia CIMB.
Historic high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to that people willingly stop their own ownership and use the opportunity to change their family shoes to be ready.
Approximately 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 cities are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we'll stop the grandfather's golden copper and get it from the next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, mentioned in recent months up to 20% increase in the number of customers uses his staff.
The growth in the stationary sector is so big that ValueMax, the wallet operator in the Bendemeer centre and 15 similars in Singapore, plans to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where he has four sides – but also outside Asia, says the Executive Director ValueMax Ja Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 per cent of 66 million SGDs that has been obtained this week to the Singapore Burge.
While some discontal believers have felt under the burning of a critical cause of high rates, Mrs. Ya, it says that the campaign offers not only lower rates than the final believers, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Clients stop the subjects already owned, and the moneys of personal property does not increase the debt of domesticity,” he says.
In the company, the property campaign is still more accepted to ensure short, safe financing.
In addition, among those who use detentions, people are not only in financial pressure.
The rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax to stop the golden or Rolex hours, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in the finish.
Our customers are from all possible circumstances.
"They belong to the rich individuals who are able to pay shortly for their courageous business or investment, or for small businesses that are helping to solve problems in their money flow," says Ms. Iava.
Sometimes they're just raising money as I don't want.
Reserve package value 325 million dollars for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that the safe package of $325 million for associating health in Tasmania contains strong submissions that will ensure that the State government does not distort financial costs.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union acts "in measures" to reverse the crisis caused by an older population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and system disorders.
Financing for four years was decided after government conferences with the independent Tasman lawyer Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with a nearly saved package, which, as we believe, will solve the specific problems to which we are head," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package contains $31 million on a patient's request.
Other 2600 operations of orthodetic operations and green log operations will help to remove debt.
Finance is also available in Hobart and Launceston's freely available clinics, better interoperable care, health specialists, mental health services and personal electronic systems of health records in local diseases.
"This investment reacts to the ideas of which the former doctors told me that they would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Mrs Plibersek said.
The Minister emphasized that the Tasmanian government must require a close system of evidence and evidence obligation.
The State will have to maintain the current level of financing to receive the money of the Australian Union and to inform monthly where additional financial costs were charged.
A three-party committee will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that 325 million dollars are to nothing, "in order to follow the real reform behind the sustainable foundation of the Tasman public health system."
However, he praised the Government for his reaction to his request for aid, which he first raised in the negotiation with the President of the Government on the beginning of May.
"I believe that the federal aid package will be able to release public health from the critical state," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the State government, these additional procedures, which have been selected, shall be expressly rejected.
The speaking federal opposition in the health of Peter Dutton is that today's statement is only a "payment".
"The reason why I am here is that the government has taken 430 million of dollars from our health system," he said for ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes at least half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which represents $300 million, and looks like it's a good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Pliberseck to ensure that no dollar from the back-up was issued to a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the new Denise Diderota, which offers exceptional film processing and creation of time, but it is also worse than it should be.
It is held in France in the 1960 ’ s, and it relates a deceitful story of Suzanne, a young man, who is sent to his family in the catastrophe.
When he rises up, he enjoys extremely cruel deal from the criminally represented mother and becomes sexually distressed for another.
The movie will never be determined to be cruel or sensitive, and that's his problem.
The formality of this story leads to that even the wildmen will enjoy a pain similar to the wearing of the wheat cow.

Syria destroyed her channels for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munic with food gas, said on Thursday, the Committee for Global Chemical Oversight, while there were some conflicts in the north of the country, and it was nearly one of the places where the food substance was stored under the conditions.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that from the beginning of the civil war, more than 120 000 people were killed three years ago.
The notice of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came before 1 November,
the term set out by this organisation with a seat in Haag by the Damascus for the destruction or disabilities of the operation of all equipment for the production of chemical weapons and machinery equipment for mixing chemical substances after the creation of commodity gas and carrying out munities.
The end of this principle of the initial phase of destruction is a significant ambitional ambitional division, which claims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus until half 2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria is able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the lady must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and resources.
It is assumed that this country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemical substances and weapons of hyperate and sarine nervous gas.
The announcement came on the time in which the fighting in the city of Safira, about which experts speak as a seat for the production of chemical weapons and storage, introduced the Syrian observatory for human rights with the seat in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through the Syrian network reported on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
It must be 61 067 civilians, 6 365 children.
On the government side, 29 954 members of the armed force of Bashara Asada, 18 678 control fighters and 187 army from Libyan Hizballáh.
There must also be 2 202 government overseers and approximately 5 375 opposition fights, of which many are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100 000 people died since March 2011 in the conflict.
This number has not been updated since that time.
The conflict offered about two million people to leave the country.
Asad units were fighting in Safira against rebels, of whom many are connected to Al-Kaido for weeks.
The observer stated that losses were on both sides, but she had no specific numbers.
The battles undermined the dangers of the chemical weapons inspectors who are at their mission when they have in the continued civil war of Syria to remove the chemical arsenal, they have to arrange with close terms.
In the statement of the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, it was said that his team is now “comprehensive that he has verified – and followed the destruction – the Syrian primary equipment for production and mixture/completion”.
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned.
Inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checking works when they visited 21 of 23 places in Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of security care, they were not able to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW Office noted that these two places were “losed and ... the items of the chemical weapons that contained were moved into two other places checked”.
It was not immediate whether the equipment in Safira were one of the places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed on the plan of complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I swear to the courage and prosperity you have shown in the completion of the most annual mission that this organization had," said the director of the observers Ahmet Uzumcu in its comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Muslim Rebels and Asad's Government stands against themselves in the civil war, especially in the Sunnith war, with their security forces, full of members of the Sect of Alavites, the staff of the Shait Islam.
In addition to further development, the observer Ramí Abdul Rahman said that in the middle of the middle of a powerful explosion in the aircraft in the Syrian coast province of Lazikia.
He said the cause of the explosion wasn't known.
Wrath on the judgement of the founder of a bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and families of 202 persons killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 reacted deeply to the sentence of the last of the founders who were set before justice, and said that Umar Patek should be corrected.
The battle, who had spent about 10 years to flee as one of the most searched people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of departure because he built explosive equipment used in the bomb attack.
It could be released subsequently in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was sealed for the guilty of a cruel murder at the attack of two night clubs in the Arrange Tourist Kuta, after which 202 people were dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also seduced in some other points of complaints related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Sweden evening 2000.
The accusation requested experience, although she could continue to get a man with the "Demolition man" overseer, thanks to his story to the expert on the production of explosions.
This decision resumed the painful ambition of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost his 39-year-old Jane and Jenny during the devastated attack on Patek and other founders ago.
With the tears in the eyes she said the Path should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should walk in the tracks of those finals.
For the AAP agent Corteen, Mrs. Corteen said, "They should be set before the corrector of the read."
Every day I have to live with that I don't see any other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when it was on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hours of a high charge located outside the parked supplier.
Peter Hughes was in the bar Pa gear, where only 20 seconds a suicide atent was burning the baths filled with explosions.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into the comma a month, and as he was maintained in life, three times “dead” to the doctors.
Mr. Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same judgment as the three final members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamy responsible for the massacre – Amrosi, Muchlas and Imama Samudr – who were repaired four years ago.
This guy should get death punishment as no one.
Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
To get 20 years because 202 people killed and hundreds of others hurt, it's not so much again.
The Path stood before the court as the last of the atentators on Bali.
The arrest was avoided almost ten years, but in January 2011 he was finally attacked in the Pakistan city Abbottabád, where the former leader Al-Kaïda Usámu bin Ladina killed about four months later.
During the Court of Justice, the FBI agent in his testimony announced that reports of reporting services found that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ladin in trying to reconnect between terrorist groups from South East Asia and Al-Kaida.
"It wasn't voluntary," Mrs. Corteen said.
He did not feel sorry until today for how much he caused distress to others.
Verdict comes before the 10th annual attack that will be late this year and will be a ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," Mrs. Corteen said.
The feet can still be revoked against the judgment.
FAA: Travellers now can use airports (but they can't call from their mobile phones)
Aeroplane passengers will be able to use their electronic equipment "from the door to the gate" – other than calling from their mobile phones – to read, play her, film monitoring and music hearing on the basis of the new rules which the Federal Airport Management (FAA) issued on Thursday.
The travelers, but they don't expect changes to happen immediately.
As the change will be carried out according to individual aircraft companies, the FAA manager Michael Huert said on printing.
The aircraft companies will have to add the management of the FAA as their airports are in accordance with the new rules and that they have updated the school manuals for the packaging facilities and the Directives for the storage of equipment to be in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA noted that it had already received plans from certain aircraft companies to expand the use of transmission electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"On the basis of the status of this plan, we can improve the extensive use of the electronic equipment very ≥", the FAA stated in its statement.
At present, travellers need to disable their smart phones, tablets and other equipment as soon as the door is closed.
They can't enable them until the airport reachs 3 km height and is not allowed.
From travelers, it is expected that their equipment will be disabled again when the aircraft falls down, and they will not switch them until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new rules, aircraft companies whose aircraft is properly protected against electronic movement may allow their passengers to use their equipment during the aircraft, aircraft and coming.
From the end of new transport aircrafts and other aircrafts that have been modified so that travellers can use Wifi at higher sea heights, it is expected that these criteria will be fulfilled.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Stewards Association, has changed.
"When new rules will be made safely – and we will cooperate closely with transport companies – it will be successful," Glading stated in its statement.
It's already saying honestly, that we look like "guardians".
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 km oversea height, said the Agency.
The traveler will be informed that their smart phones, tablets and other equipment will be changed to the aircraft.
So still no Words with friends, online game of scrabble that played herc Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011 when he was, as well known, exited from the American Airlines airlines airport because he refused to disable his equipment when the aircraft was parked at the door.
And more hard equipment like notebooks will be needed to be stored for fear that they could hurt someone if they were flying after the cabin.
Mobile talks will still be banned on the cart.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not the FAA, but the American Federal Telecommunication Committee.
The FAA may cancel the prohibition in some electronic equipment during the emission and accession.
Last month Mark Rosenker from the State Security Committee on Transport, a national security expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"The mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can create potentially broadcasting with navigation devices, but FCC data also know that they can cause in the air the discharges of sendings," Rosenker said.
The Working Advisory Committee established by the FAA administration in order to examine this problem, proposed last month to allow the Government to enable the use of electronic equipment to be greater.
The FAA has been developed in recent years to measure limitations to their use.
Criticals, such as Senator McCaskilva, Democracy of Missouri, claim that there is no legal security guarantee for this prohibition.
Limitations are also more difficult because use of such equipment is available everywhere.
Some studies indicate that until a third of travellers is binding to disable or ignore their equipment.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic equipment traveling in 1966 in reaction to the movement of navigation and communication equipment when travellers started carrying FM ́dia, the technical expenditure of the time.
New aircraft companies are much more referring to electrical systems than aircrafts of previous generations, but are also constructed, and are approved by the FAA administration to be dismissed against electronic breakdown.
The aircraft companies have offered a traveling Wi-Fi use in overseas highs.
Plans for Wi-Fi systems are also more dealing with disturbance.
The large number of aircraft companies should be adapted in the context of the new rules for more use of electronic equipment, said Huert.
Current electronic equipment generally cause much less intensity to send than it was in previous generations.
For example, the electronic reading issues only the minimum sending of the page.
But sending is stronger when equipment download or send data.
Among those who press to free the limits for use of these equipment by travellers, it is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company installed the transport aircraft by their electronic readers Kindle and carried out the experimental years, but there was no problem.
The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA have expressed mixed feelings as regards whether these equipment represent a fair risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airlines passengers said that it was convinced that the distortion of these equipment is equivalent, even if the risk is minimum.
Other members of the Committee announced that there are only chargeable reports from pilots who have to support the fact that such equipment can cause aircraft breaches, and the number of these reports is very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA pilots permit the passengers to disable equipment during the flights for low visibility.
The Road Industrial Group welcomed these amendments, and it seems to be a reasonable procedure for traveling publics that uses in many ways.
"We are pleased that the FAA felt that a pleasant journey is not in contrast with security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Road to the Association.
The bird was transported aircraft from the garden area in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found out on the landscape in the Black Sea, and was released back to the free nature.
One crossed was transferred to Aberdeen last month after it had been treated by the Scotch company SPCA in the salvation centre until he was healed.
Colin Seddon's carrier said: "It was probably a migration from northern Europe when he was captured by a strong wind over the North Sea."
According to all, he got power and he found the refuge on the floor.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was not able to fly again, so we were contacted with the request of help."
At the time he was kidnapped, he was in a good concision and a good way.
Is the European elite prepared for trade with British?
Campaign Business for Britain (British Trade) was launched in April with the promise to join undertakings and to define the changes in relation to the EU.
We have made the biggest and most complex investigations in which the former British enterprises have asked their opinions regarding British, trade, and EU.
YouGov asked 1000 leaders of British business representatives of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the investigation will be for many surprises.
We have seen that the harmful majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while the EU states stagnate.
They want to see how the Government predicts new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil as to prevent the long and increasing process of reform of secret European institutions.
When we asked their opinions on specific political policy — from monopol regulations after production law —, the majority of enterprises expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The general uncomfortableness of the single market and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels Regulations are now overwhelmed by the benefits of being part of the European Trade — even 40 per cent of large enterprises, thus traditionally the largest European company.
Finally, our investigation of the leading firms has discovered the most prompt knowledge, and although a unique person wants to make British effort to make a change in relations with the EU, which should be based on trade, not political.
The finding with which different sizes and main business groups have been identified shows that the enterprise sector is pressing on the "complete change" that will affect the impact of the British report.
In the case of the changes in the European Union and the improvement of the British agreement, it may mean to 16 % by voting in the EU Reference.
The President of the Government should not weigh: this investigation shows that the British trade supports its plan of renewation of British membership submissions in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects that this newization will mean a significant movement from the current export of power back to British.
The better agreement for British is possible, and as the way the euro is issued for an external economic and fiscal Union, it is still more necessary.
It must be a priority for the work of the place and growth in Britain, and as the results of our investigation indicate, this means re-interaction to trade and the main change in the regulation approach to Brussels.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States have sometimes been spending "too far", according to the AFP agency, John Kerry's American diplomatic leader during the video between Washington and London.
But, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to reject terrorist attacks.
"Acknowledgement from Washington" according to the AFP included the polemics on both Atlantic borders due to scandal discovery of the broad monitoring of the data of the American National Security Agency (NSA), which also became American associations.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have passed too far and we ensure that this will happen in the future," said Kerry.
In the conversation, however, he was primarily in practice.
The collection of information is required for the fight against terrorism and the protection of atents, such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the United States, atents in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prohibited the aircraft to fall, the buildings exploded and the people were killed because we were able to be informed once of the records," Karry stressed.
Nevertheless, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unusually far."

Alexei Miller from Gazprom's company says that the train in Bulgaria starts a new gas era
The beginning of the South Stream Gas building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom director.
"We are witnesses of the border today: the building in the Bulgarian part of South Stream Gas, the largest and most important project in Europe," President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream requirement should add diversity to Russian export roads through Europe.
The agreement between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which bring Russian gas into Europe, adds to the risk of conventional travellers, say officials.
Miller says that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" deleted.
Once the whole project starts its operation in 2015, the Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream Gas at a high price.
Gazprom says that building in other countries is in the direction of running at the end of this year.
Glynovod is proposed for the annual capacity of 2.2 billion to the ground gas stops.
Hizballah sent thousands of battles to Syria.
Waiting is a decisive battle.
Lebanon's movement of Hizballah has distributed 15,000 battles north of Damascus in preparation for a decision-making battle on the hornation of Kalamun.
According to the spectacular reports of Israel, in the middle of two places in Western Syria, he destroyed the rackets just designed to Hizballah.
This Libanon Shit organization fights in Syria on the side of the dark army.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not meet the Syrian conflict, but said that the threat of the movement of arms to the hands of Hizballah to Lebanon was threatened.
The reports on the Mediterranean Neighbourhoods on weapons in Western Syria are first determined.
Israel's attack was commented, but the American resources confirmed him.
For the Syrian website Dampress.com, the rackets of the Mediterranean Sea of the Syrian Rakete Base Snubar Jabla south of Latvia.
The reporting station Al-Arabia states that two funds were placed in which rackets were prepared for transport to Libanon.
Its resources caused Russian production racket SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but the military analytic Ron Ben Jishai said that Syria is continually trying to resource Hizballah with rackets and the Syrian aircraft teaches members of the armed section of Hizballáh with rackets.
SA-8 are old rackets that have Syrian army since the 80s.
They're located on a moveable transport.
Although they are relatively receiving, the mobility and small dimensions may be easy to hide.
They are equipped by a radar that will turn off after the shooting, so it's hard to fix them.
Latakia is located in Western Syria, in the population of Governing Alavites.
It's a well-respected and the Hizballah has just participated in fights in West Syria in the past.
He claims that he helps protect the Syrian Shit community, to which the warrants belong.
Now the 15,000 of his battles are probably ready to help get back in the army of Kalamun.
Along with Hizballa, the Syrian army also strengthens its units.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle must be carried out by the Al-Arabian resources for a recent attack of opposition on the domination of the Syrian Shit Brigade of Fadla Abbase in the Cheit part of Damask.
Hizballáh helped the Syrian army to fight the city of Kusajr at the Libyan border.
A lot of rebels from Kussair went just to Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Republic of Czech had desired a preliminary choice.
As d'aes, corruptions were stated, money exhausts for prejudiced purchases and state prohibitions, tax increases and government scandal in the past.
According to the results of elections, a number of citizens has expressed this status.
The fact that they did not do this, and they were actually peaceed with the status that was here (decreasing and debt of this State).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 electors did not have the elections, 596 357 electors chose TOP 09 384 174 electors, so 4 394 028 were actually supported by the Governing Coalition, which represents 52.16% of all legal electors.
That's the over half.
In addition to the above sides of 1 016 829 CSSD electors, then with an old order (for all of these parties participated in "decreasing" and debt of this State), 64.23% of the legal electors agreed with this status.
In fact, the electors have shown that they are not for decreasing and prejudice to the debtors of the State.
Or do you think the members of the CSSD who shared the principle of the relevant law?
Is it all to help us?

The Royal Commission learned that before the complaints against Jonathan Lord, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) were accused
The Royal Committee for Sexual Injury of Children learned that before the accusation had been raised against the Children Educator Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young People (YMCA) in the New South Wales were complained about sexual abuse of children.
However, before the Commission, it was noted that in their introductory statement to the Commission, this Association stated that they had never resolved the case of sexual abuse of the child in their organization.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked for the case when one of YMCA's employees was accused of infant pornography crimes and the other when the bodybuilder in Caringbah from YMCA's association was sentenced in 1991 for the sexual burden of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare said to Gaili Furness, the adviser of the Commission, he's talking about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the introductional declaration of the YMCA association was also inaccurate when it stated that the YMCA organisation had performed external audits that had evaluated this organisation as a preliminary station of children's rights.
The evidence submitted to the Commission is that the YMCA organisation was warned that in the Ministry of School and Company audit of August this year received the second of the four possible evaluations.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA association when he was 21 years old, admitted that the leading from him failed by his own direction down when Mr. Lord accepted and would not be sure that it was the staff's obligation to announce the infringement of the child's security rules.
Before this year, Lord was sentenced for sexual charges of 12 boys who had been allowed for two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He was arrested for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, refused to say that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that protected the staff to report the infringement of children's safety by Mr. Lord.
Members gave evidence to the staff that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with children alone, especially watching them, let them sit at the clinik, tell them that they were my own, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the Lord's subjection and asked for the training of children's security because she was concerned about his behavior, proved that Jluc Barnat, leader of child service in the YMCA association in the city of Caringbah, who was the Lord's overseer, was “very scared and often was hard to talk to him about something”.
The Director-General said that it was not accepting evidence of the staff that they felt not knowing if they had to contact their headquarters and effects.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord was darkened by their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that by the Council of the YMCA association in the New South Wales, he informed his opinion that the teaching from Jonathan Lord's " case" for the organization is that the staff "not sent any message" and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow the staff to sign the silence agreements soon after the accusation occurred, the general manager for children's services in the YMCA Liam Whitley organisation.
He said that the goal was to avoid distorting evidence, but it was "deeply fierce" and wrongly carried out.
Professor Stephen ALLBONe from the Griffitho University said to the Commission that YMCA in the New South Wales was not safe for children in 2009 to 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in setting, checking, job, education and staff management.
The hearing was revoked on 20th.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return to the post of the ministerial president, but he admitted that the return was unlikely.
In the night discussion at the occasion of the fifth year, the 59-year policy expressed its opinions on the different domestic policy.

When he was asked if he would return to the post of the ministerial president, his response in the London newspaper Evening Standard felt like: "Yes, of course, but it is likely hard to do so, so..."
While the expert experts in Cardiff were concealed to fight for the price of the Year's Horse, it was aware that competition was easily.
But no one was ready for a three-year Fentton Kirkland.
Although he doesn't go to school and just a few months ago he made the first boy, this boy and his animal boy, the shetland poin Toffee, the colds were closing three wheels to finally get the main price and leave 30 wheels with adults.
This unseparable two - with the same height - was on an annual competition conducted by Sunnybank in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for the view, behaviour and behaviour.
He was standing against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant clothes, put his bar in a happy angle and let his two-year Toffee shift after the circuit.
Fenton was praised for his natural ability to control the horse, which is far above his cup.
And Toffee got the highest signs for view and personality.
Fenton Toffee got to his third birthdays in March, and since then with this shetland ponik, he practices daily.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee are greatly cooperating."
They didn't make a big place, but finally they left with the golden coat and kitchen.
It was just based on what Toffe and I convinced, and when he wined, we were overwhelming.
Everyone thought him to be a phenomenon and a completely stranger people wanted to photograph him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is walking in the tracks of his tante Sharon Howells, who leads horses over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere, and everyone encouraged and rejoiced."
He was running through the sand throughout the length of the arenin, and even though he did so little, he gave a great effect.
Fenton is owned animals – he loves horses, tractors and pharmaceuticals and has been concerned about two kitchens.
Given how he started, he'll be on the competition of the Year's Horse and I'm sure he'll be good.
“Fentons are only three, but they know how to control the ponic.”
It's a great team together.
The portfolio took Fenthon and Toffee for their excellent evidence and for the way they had been transferred to the competitive area.
They always follow how good the team work is between the ponic and the leader – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the wallet.
I'm sure Fenton's helped a pleasant clothes, he really fell with him.
Too famous newspapers have to be investigated
The Chinese newspapers, which, on the title side, requested to release the reporter accused of the negotiation, will be considerately investigated, said the print manager.
New Express newspapers with the seat in Guangzhou have made a rare public request to release the journalist Chen Yongzhoua.
However, Mr. Chen later in television admitted that he took taxes to invent his stories about the company partly owned by the country.
The manager said that New Express newspapers will now perform "full repair".
The "reparation" device came from the State Administration for Printing and Publication, Review, Film and TV in the Kuang-tung province.
The preliminary investigation showed that in the period from September 2012 to August 2013 the newspaper New Express from the eventing news group was issued a number of uncertain reports about that company by Zoomlion.
"The New Express newsleader was unreasonable," he said in his advertising of the manager.
He said that he had to decide to "invoke a penalty to Chen Yongzhou's administration in the form of a cancellation of the newsletter".
Furthermore, “his ordered the Quacheng Group Evening News to perform the general adjustment of New Express, and recommended to investigate the responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the leading of New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles relating to financial inequalities in the building equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspapers issued on the title page two requests for his release and claimed that they were deserving his journal work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared in the state television and admitted that he had delivered false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused a damage to Zoomlion and to the whole media sector and his ability to get public confidence," he said at the State reporting station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and glory.
I realize I did wrong.
After apologize, Mr. Chena issued a new Express letter on the title page of an apologizing, in which he noticed that he failed when he did not perform sufficient control of his messages.
Recently, a number of followed suspects have been accepted in television.
The experts say that the recognition is still regularly distorted, without prejudice to the change of law from the annual year, which prohibits the authorities to impose any person to be accused of himself.
It was found a tunnel for feeding drugs between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most significant tunnels for feeding drugs between the United States and Mexico, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical railway.

In 2010, the offices found a driving of approximately 650 meters of a set, which led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two storages in San Diego.

The British police gave Assange an announcement of the issue
Today, the British police gave an announcement of the issue of the founder WikiLeaks to Julian Assange, who found a camp at the Ecuadoral Majesty in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard announced that for the 40-year Australian, he gave a "notification" to the Australian by seeking him to get to the police station and that if he doesn't, he could threaten his arrest.
Assange in the British Law has exhausted his opportunities when the High Court has canceled his revocation against the issue this month, and he is heading to Sweden for the accusation of sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, on June 19, he looked for a campaign on the Equadoral District in London, where this Southeame country requested asylum.
Scotland Yard “invoked a 40-year-old report to the 40-year-old man who requested to get to the police station on the day and hour he had been appointed” said the speaker.
Assange continues to hurt the cooking undermines.
The Wikipedia refused to comment on the notice of the issue.

As a result of the tax on the owners of the insolvency of the londry bubble
The Ministry of Finance has preliminaryly calculated the tax of the financial property, but expects the final decision of Mr. Osborna, which, in the 2012 budget of 2012, represented a payment of 7 % for the transfer of buildings in price over 2 million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billions for buyers owning their own abilities in the company, not as individuals.
The taxation for the transfer of unnecessaryness in the apartment fund during Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which in 2012/13 reached 708 million frees, already exceeds the total sum of North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northwest, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber Dohromades.
Mr Cook said: “As a result of growth in the transfer of inability in homes of high value and representation of a related legislation that is to prevent tax prevention, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high values is little given without the effect of the old tax system from the head.”
He added that “this step could cause in some investors to purchase inability in London, if the existing owners were to sell.”
The primary inability – up to 5 % to 10 % of the residence market according to the price – in the wealthy pass from Fulham after Wimbledon, changed the growth of records of 11,8 % in the past year.
The prices in the middle of London continued to show a continuous growth of 5,6 % since year, but were shadowed by the flowing "home market", which, according to the investigation of the realistic office of Savills, was increasing in Southeast, North (7,4 %) and east (6,5 %) increase.
Scientists have lighted more how ocasus moves are related to the dog's nail
Earlier research showed that the joyful dogs turn on more transport (for dog view), while nervous dogs are mainly left.
However, now the doctors say that the final dogs can make these fair differences in the mouse of ocasus and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist from the University of Trent, said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain has a different link to the highlights that excite positive or negative emotions.”
We tried to watch the same thing in other kinds.
He added that the right side of the brain is responsible for the left moves and the opposite and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In trying to obtain further information about how dogs react to the indirect ocasing of other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching films of other dogs.
They measured the frequency of these animals and analysed their behavior.
Obviously, it takes time before we understand why their eye goes on the one side, and on the other side.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We made dogs films about dogs – either in a natural version, or in the form of siluet – and we saved any maturity undertakings, and we could also modify the ocasus movement and illustrate it more right or left.”
When the animals saw an insignificant dog move by the ocasus of the transport (with the view of the dog rotating ocasus), she remained completely calm.
However, when it mentioned the ocasus turning mainly to the left (recommended by the dog rotating ocas), their heat frequency increased and animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn't think he would communicate one another through these moves.
Moreover, he thinks that the dogs have learned from experience what moves they have to do and who they don't need to take care of.
He said: "When you see dogs and their mouth in one direction is repeatedly connected to friendly behaviour and movement of transport is less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Scientists say that discovery can help dogs, veterinarians and trainers better understand their animal emotions.
The expert for the conduct of dogs John Bradshaw, a high school teacher at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side is important for dogs.
Last year, Lincoln University team found that dogs turn their head to the left when they watch the aggressive dog, and it is when it comes to a happy dog.
And in another professional negotiation from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “I mean, with the son of a robot, dogs were listed with more probabilities when he rotted on the left-to-left end of the transport, when they were more injust – just instead of the Italian study.”
The division may be given according to the fact that dogs in these different studies in films or dogs of robots were not completely as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to dogs.
“Although in many different sofas there are fatal evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different weights, many details are still needed to be explained – and dogs are not exceptional, ” he said.
But as it is easy to mention their behavior, obviously it is to take time before we realize why their eyes go on one side and on the other side.
Arctic Monkeys for the disease of Alexe Turner moved a concert in Glasgow
The rock group of Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow after the main songs were sing.

Pape František named the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Papa Frantiszek, on February 22, first named new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinal owners in the spirituality of the Catholic Church are the highest position immediately after the papa and are those who choose the papa, so Frantiszek will establish his first group of men who will finally help to choose his representatives.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, when the cardinal reaches 80 years, the papa's choices cannot be reached — the group is thus decreased to 120 choices of cardinales.
In an announcement of this report, Patrico Federico Lombardi, speaker of Vatican, said that before the celebration of new cardinals, the storage of current cardinals will be made known as a concistory.
"Papa František decided to communicate his decision to invite the concistrium forward to facilitate the planning of final confusions, which require cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices magazine said that a number of choices of cardinales probably gets down to February.
He said that papa usually names so many cardinals as needs to increase the number of electors again to 120, and so many cardinals that exceed 80 years as he wants.
The Concistrium will be important in the next year because it will be the first time František was chosen in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, a certain orientation is shown to Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new papa names cardinales from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only an incredible number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since the time that František has established the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals in the world, who has given it to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, papa decided everything for himself.
"Now František has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was “so much likely ” that these cardinals were asked for advice.
But we haven't been in this case before – it's a complete news.
Valero said that Papees traditionally increased in the position of the bishops from large places, but František is "full of surprise - so we don't know who he names."

The "The Audacity to Win" is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is a conference to the presidential Barack Obama campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patient's orders tonight and I'm going to bed, the book returns me to the time when politics inspired millions of people and shows that you were breathing.
The elections ended with a drive overwhelming, and the television reports have made us think about the historical value of this moment.
My companions wept joyfully, and my parents hid the news they had.
In the White House, a young team of vipers was prepared for change.
During the introduction to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent support.
And I'm closing the book here.
To go to the present, it's a huge wake up, as to get out of sleep.
It is hard to carry these optimistic days – they seem to be remote ancestors, quiet in the deceased opportunity.
In the years after I put my first election letter, changed.
It was absolutely nothing of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and numerous successes – from the law on accessible care through the release of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy "not ask anything, nothing to say" after the death of Usama bin Ladina.
Furthermore, I am convinced that the side obstructions have rejected so many efforts to move our people forward: among others it is immigration reform, public opportunity to choose health care and close the foundation in Guantanama.
But after many events, when I defended Obama's administration against colleagues and friends, I grew up to the absolute limit.
I felt in a political place without a nanae.
The obstructions of the Republicans may not explain the approval of the audience of the foreign leaders or the attacks of the non-pilot aircraft that kill innocent children in the morning.
They can't explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans, nor that it follows those who reject the wrong government's conduct.
They cannot be responsible for the correction of Anwara al-Awlakí, the American citizen, without legal court or restriction of public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They can't be justified to find a news that says that the efforts of the White House to quiet the media are "neagresiveer ... than Nixo's administration".
And the latest can not even excuse the failure to create more than three years after signing the law on a simple website care.
I don't know if something like that could have been waiting.
Whether I had 18 years of age to think that government power could be in contrast with the political campaigns they had previously done.
It is obvious that it has no predictable progress and our public discussions will create a oppositional political party and an adequate event, such as the massacre in Newton.
However, all of the examples I have mentioned above seem to be the result of my own administrative decision.
And it's most painful for me.
I called both again in 2012, but not because I was excited from his candidature.
Mitt Romney represented a mature and unbreaked alternative, and it seemed he couldn't align his policy or position.
I felt that the second oval period for Obama, released from pressure of the next elections, would be filled with the things we have ever heard.
However, the return to 2008 – how Obama's support in this week was decreased under 45% – is more difficult in this book.
They're forced me to take up a number of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read the Obama about how Obama was suffering from a dramatic hurt with Clinton in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he said to his note that he had to get from the temper and remain strict to his mission.
"I want our stick," he said.
We can't guess who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I'm totally agreed with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in the midst of interests for the program of parental authorisation
The billioner and Mr. Clive Palmer said that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in the center of interests for the program of parental authorisation because his daughters can be pregnant and weak.
The banan magnate, which leads to a dispute due to the refund of the carbon tax dimension at a value of 6 million dollars, made this claim when he tried to move from the table to the question whether it was in the middle of interest.
Palmer’s United Party may control up to four votes in the senate, which are a major role in determining whether to choose taxes from carbon and heavy activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in the centre of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in the position where they could have personal benefits from the policy.
"He has reached a large centre of interest in the payable parental allowance, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would have a parent allowance," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections of the elections of the election committee, Mr. Palmer officially announced the victory in the fight against the chair of Fairfax in Sunshine Coast, thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to take place the process.
Tony's daughter Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Should these options be decided two months after closing the election rooms?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can we not have a system where you can come, print details on the computer, vote immediately and have results at half the seventh evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of the tube to identify the voting letters.
Is that the results can be broken if someone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of the claims appears to be incredible.
The election committee studied the options of electronic vote and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme was also related to the airport in Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new job "very serious".
The public office is public service.
"We are not seeking any recompense except that we can serve the company at this critical time," he said.
Do you have your hands?
The scientists have found that they're moving you with your hands.
The experiment was involved in 98 persons divided into three groups.
Two of them had to resolve an unresoluble role.
Of course, both did not succeed.
But the group who was laughing his hands was more optimistic than the one where her hands were not missing.
In the next test, the group with the hands was better than the other one.
Yet, those who laughed their hands, in other tests, were worse results than those who weren't knocked.
The results of the "sleep" were at the level of the third group, which the leaders did not register any advanced failure.
The test results indicate, according to psychologists, that physical cleanness eliminates negative feelings after failure.
In addition, however, the motivation decreases, the tests need to concentrate much more in other trials.
When they transferred research results to Czech, they were likely the most optimistic after returning from the WC.
After the use of the WC, the hands are not only one percent of the Czech and the Czech, but on the road of the city transport is five.
On hygiene, they also have a liquor after working in the garden or in a long time when 85 percent of people have their hands.
The covering of the householder motivates 78.7 percent of people to move their hands.
The recent investigation discovered that there is a division in the view of the Czech and the Slovaks, as it is necessary to wash hands after giving hands to a stranger.
In this case, 28.8 per cent of the Czech and 40.3 per cent of the Slovak.
The research showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be at the place, I'm afraid that reality is different and people's trying to do so a little better," commented the results of the study of the skin doctor Klaudie Komárk.
RBS suspends two commercials with a foreign currency
According to two persons notified, the Scotland Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in their division with a foreign currency, which is further indicating that the global investigation of the control authorities relating to suspicious mixtures with the monetary market is still more frequent.
Some of the biggest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in the world’s largest financial market investigations, where they change 5.3 billion USD owners every day.
The amendments to two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in an expanding investigation , which would be responsible to the scandal with the LIBOR rates (Lundian interbanko/rate rates).
The Bank refused to comment on suspension, but confirmed that this month had received information request from the authorities.
"Our unexpected career in this matter continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank declared two weeks ago.
Last month, people who have near this event have noticed that RBS has transmitted to the British Authority the financial behaviour of e-mail records and reports sent from and to the former trademan.
This trademaker, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and assumed that he was released from his current position of the European President of Foreign Trade in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Preparation Chairman in Citi, has spent the allowed week, while Matt Gardiner, an ex-worker for currency trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither one of these negotiators has been accused of any crime.
In Mr. Usher's group for sending reports, bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people said dedication to this event.
This week UBS stated that after the Swiss Control Authority notified that it had investigated suspicious machinery on the market with a foreign currency in some of the Swiss banks, it took steps against some of its employees.
At least six officials – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopole Office Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – examines the claim that these bankiers were associated to move with the monetary market.
Furthermore, the people reported that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had made an internal investigation or received information request from the competent authorities.
Banks are spent years by old reports and emails to find cases of crimes.
The investigation reports have been scared by trademakers in Âa, which was one of the largest engines for the creation of profits in investment banks in the past years, but which was suspended by limiting the opportunity for speculators.
Some bankers tried to decrease the difficulty of the banking when they claimed that with a large and high liquid market with a foreign currency, it was essentially impossible to manipulate, but the high positions of the trademakers say that it is not necessary to be true.
A highly established trademaker said that despite a significant volume of the daily trade with the foreign currency of liquidity tests between different trade platforms and banks which increase their own internal platforms, “You can be able to begin to affect the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day when the Credit Suisse announced that this week she lost its trade department, which caused a loss of 6 million USD at the end of the past year.
The Bank immediately warned the competent authorities and cooperated with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this businessman acted alone and that this problem was resolved," said Credit Suisse.
The beginning of HIV decayed in Prague passed thousands
Physicians in Prague have evaluated more than thousands of people with HIV virus.
From the beginning of the investigation in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of the year, the tests confirmed the penalty of a total of 1005 persons from metropole.
This results from a national reference operator for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to the whole CR, 2 063 were still killed.
In 396 infirmities of immunity failure has already occurred.
198 people died.
The beginning of the caught in Czech in the last decades grows annually.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later they had been 12%
In 2009, the investigation discovered 156 new sentences and then 180 in 2010.
The past amount decreased to 153, but the lone was recorded.
According to the laboratory, they were 212.
"On the fact that the total number of newly reported cases over 200 years, I think it is no doubt," the expert on the AIDS Miroslav Hevati problem, which has led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests have been detected in 39 people and the last year in 47, introduced the Hlavati.
In September, 21 new patients and three patients were tested.
From the beginning of follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease has occurred in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever wants to know the town, he's supposed to go to the funeral.
His visit is more than the running of the centre of memories, churches and galeries, more than he would prosecut the bedeker.
Many people are reading from the graves.
The funeral is slow and will get an intimate view of local reality.
They find out who people live here, which nations, the faiths, belong to the great and coherent families in which they die here, how rich are, how important their titles and professionals were for them.
In what way they express their community positions, how they enjoy.
And from the state of the graves, they will also find out how they will remain in their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Healthcare Law
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that the health care law signed by Barack Obamau is in accordance with the statute, which is the primary victory for Obama's administration.
With regard to vote 5:4 the Court decided that the individual law on the protection of patients and available care – which provides for citizens to buy health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatening them to pay repentance – does not resist the statement based on the government tax authority.
The President of Judge John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alita and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of 2700 pages of the law and further decided that the legal requirements for health care that will enlarge States’ possibility of obtaining a disease insurance, in other cases, threatening the financing of all disease insurance from the federal resources is not a donation and in contrast to the establishment.
The complaint for the locking of this law was granted to 26 States and the National Federation of independent undertakings.
During the primary year 2012, the Law rejected all of the main Republican candidates, in particular the proposed candidate Mitta Romney.
According to the words "Mugabe is a bowl's ass" no threat, the court has cancelled the law
To this end, Zimbabweans had to take a good care of how the public talks about the Ninety-eighty-year Mugabe, who rules the country since the beginning of the 80s, and since the end of 1987, stands at her head.
In accordance with section 33 of the Criminal Act, the Chairman's distortion threatened the penalty of $100 until one year of freedom.
"State representatives should not warmly accuse people who comment on the president in economics or other public places," declared the representatives of the Court of Justice.
The nine judges agreed uniminally that the law undertook the freedom of expression.
It is probably possible that the Government has revoked the Court's decision, and the British BBC has informed.
In contrast with the law, a number of damaged Zimbabwans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by the police for two years ago for the consequence of the president's injury in the bar with the policeman.
In May, the opposition activist attended Mugabe's public with "cooking axe".
In August, the prosecutor accused a sixty-five-year-old man for his intention to use a place with Robert Mugabe as a toilet paper.
The Court also announced the anti-constitutional law that restricted the freedom of media.
"State can't disappoint people whose statement will be shown as an injustice," said the Minister for Justice of Luke Malal.
Until now, the Zimbabwe law enabled the person who published false information to be sentenced to 20 years of prison.
"The existence of a law that allows criminalization to somebody for an injust statement has a congeling person to be expressed freely," added Malala.
Despite that Mugabe is a government of the country in hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a reference to a new statute with larger civil freedoms in March.
Small rounds from the dictature of a man of the country arrived in 2009 when the agreement between Mugabem and Opposition came to Morgan Tsvangiraje's Primary chair.
However, the earth continues to suffer economic crisis, and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world has exceeded 100 000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government rejected the national currency.
Today, it is only applied to the currency of other States in Zimbabwe.
The promoted economy goes to Mugabe's invaluable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he divided the ground of white farmers between his hosts and war veteranas.
Yet, most of them had no experience with the risk of walking.
The central banks will maintain the swap lines forever
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Feder, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a continuous tool that will enable banks to access global currency whenever they need.
The banks made it in their joint declaration.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow's decision, the main international economy of the London Bank Barclays.
"Too long all transitional tools of this type have become permanent, so it is not according to my surprise," adds the Bend Soldiers, the main BH Securities economy.
The central bankiers strengthen the accounts that began to occur in 2007 when the international credit market was first cut off.
Central bank agreements have enabled access to euros, dollars and other changes to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at the time when the American Fed is prepared for the end of its programme of support for the American Economic Aid, which could reduce the price of money on the global market too higher.
The swap contract shall be used by default to convince the lack of liquidity of one currency in the current residue of the liquidity of the second currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a currency payment of the other.
The ECB starts the third attempt to return trust to the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on bank surveillance, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
Like Tipsport (no)missing personal data.
More than a year ago, I performed the registration on the Tipsport.cz pages.
But I didn't finish here afterwards, because someone just sat on the hall, who couldn't finish the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another side, the registration was fallen, then I moved, and it changed my address and the number of civil evidence.
When I wanted to finish the registration after, it was told me that it wasn't going because I have another OP number, address, and that it just couldn't be done and that I had to ask for the deletion of data and perform a new registration.
So I did this, and 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I requested to remove all my personal data from the database according to the valid personal data protection law.
It's a spiritual day that the technical support was written to me that I've got the registration to finish the hall.
This started the e-mail maraton for technical support, where, finally, after the fourth Urgent 25.10, they wrote that personal data were deleted on my request.
So man would say that he could carry out the new registration and the problems started up here first, it wrote me that my name is already located (It wasn't deleted - not about personal data, but finally it was organized).
Thus, I used another name and pointed out that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration on the hall (how they could have stored something that they claimed to be removed?), so I contacted the technical support again.
To my question, how maybe they described me that personal data were deleted 25.10, and to send e-mail with that mistake.
I learned this (only 15 hours yesterday) and they described it to me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that it is not because I used the same name and birth date.
What I've been contacting technical support for a week, and I've decided that it still doesn't happen.
And what about the fact that if it was true (as not) it could not be registered with the corresponding name or the same birth date if it was already registered.
Only in those 13.22 I registered myself, at the same name and birth date, but I used a thought e-mail and a phone number and the world's wonders, the page appeared to me that they sent me a link to the e-mail to finish the registration.
But how is it possible if you can't register on the same name and birth date?
It may be because Tipsport cares for the e-mail registration and the phone number and data simply did not fit as it claims.
So I reported this technical support again that they're just lying (will be prominent and or don't know what it writes) because what it writes is not true.
I suggested that the problem with registration was already before 31.10, so "false" registration has no effect on this.
I'm sorry, but because you're already registered, we can't check your claim.
And the communication ended.
Respectives repeat at the same time as the registration is weakened by name and birth date.
They cannot even accept that the registration has not been completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and it has not been done.
So I'm going to shrink it, Tipsport, not only that he's not thinking of the data as he's saying, but still lies when he's opposed.
It's worse that it can easily prove how they lie and try to seem to be a mistake on the side of the client.
Despite the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things have been a little moved and from Technical Support has come to the email that the matter is going to be checked and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and review and warning on the same error).
Music plays in a metro on the Mount
Transport undertaking hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music project in a meter.
By the festibul, where the reproduced instrumental music plays continually during the operation of a metro, the loop of line A is on the output of the Vaklav location.
The test operation takes six months.
Michal Horaček represented his new double albums, cape and three songs
The texter Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the town community, not only his completely new doubleCD Czech calendar, but especially in the order Lienka Nova, Frantiska Segrada and Ondu Rumla, provided by the excellent Orchestrem Mateja Benka.
After the introduction of the intru and the heretic study of the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three songs to the poddium, himself came with a lamp in his hand and remembered the story of how they finally played in the Knive and in the divorce and in the entire city out of power.
"It's like that in the Knie two kinds of cards with which I've been able to join a lot," he said.
He also reminded President Zeman's parent.
"Perhaps they could have made tours after Zakolan or Dubravce at Bratislava," he wondered about the parents of other presidents.
Sometimes in the evening, Horach, who didn't leave the trailer, and if he didn't speak, sitting at the centuries with a cup of wine, touched his new musical rest.
The calendar also made Joseph Manes, who gave him on the air, about the yellow hoke, but that time he didn't know anything about how we're going on those places and scanning who doesn't shoot, it's not the Czech.
So one song from the Czech calendar is also called, but we don't play here today," he distressed.
Ondra Ruml, however, sing out of this table for a lot of suitable Satur on the day, sing after night, and sing on it on cytarr.
Otherwise, if he didn't singe, he played percuses, and all three songs, then he brought the cap in the lock of the keys, the violoncello, the cytar and the contrabs.
All three vocalists together sing a little sing in the side of the heart, which immediately spread the vision.
"I'm not surprised that the song gave you the song, which didn't surprise me in the town of Moch," Michal Horaček answered.
After the exposure to Petra Hapku, I recognize Františka Segrad, originally recompensed by Richard Mıer with a huge applause, Hanu Heger again reminded the song of Daddy had Lidu Barar and with the Horack Explanation of the Communist Prohibition and replacement of the Baar American Heric Mae West.
Michael Kocába again reminded the Sebastian track, and Segrado sang a beautiful song of Praha, a witched Garden of Freedom, a disturbing parent and an ex-Kniniñac.
But it was already a conclusion, a stick in standing and an additive in the form of optimistic tracks We live in a beautiful time.
The playlist was prepared for another addition, but the fans haven't seen it anymore.
Soon after the concert, the whole fourman sat on the table to sign not only the Czech calendar but also the older CD, Michal Horáček, and even the pack from the Legendary LP and with the eventual interesters, and photographed.
Berdycha with Šteem supplements Rosol and Hajek
At the final of Davis' campaign against Serbia, he nominated the non-player of the Czech tenists Jaroslav returned to the fourth to Tomás Berdych, Radek Stepánek, Lukas Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The Czech representatives of the trophey are stuck, but they are playing in the white garden aren, where the cargo is on the strong surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the final, Czechs have been third in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the warm ground that it'll be wild and we have to focus on our performance."
"We'll go there with the only goal - get three points and sell the best," said Stépanek, a victory of a victory point in the remote final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
School for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Valley.
The Israelites had exactly foretold how to look like Syria's bombing.
Without an improper humbuck, threats, and millions of announcements, they sent a plane, they set the goal and returned.
Without allowing the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and do not express it anymore.
The exact opposite of the deceased and great destructive acts of Obama's Syrian Policy.
And the most satisfactory at all the attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media get off by their claims that it was bombarded "Syric Base" or "extensions for Hizballah".
Recently, I wrote that while the United States' help for the secondary rebels in the country only remains on a retoric level, Russia's joyfully adds Syria's weapons.
And just a fresh delivery of Russian raketes in Latvia's presence became an ark of Israel’s nail.
A clear message.
And note, Israel bombed Asa's regime again, not the rebellious, although it should be in contrast with the archaeological theories of the Internet.
The US Government designated two members of the space units, probably Delta force.
It has not been done until now that they were listed during the attack on the American Consulat in Bengasia.
The herotic death is known to two former SEALs members who have caught the area in the city, I believe that it was the members of the secret order, which was created by former soldiers.
It was speculated long what SEALs did on a consulate or even in another placed residue.
Now it's clearer.
Any information that has its offices protected by culometary nids in Libya (only on one of these, both SEALs have lost after the minometh threshold) is relatively surprising.
But more surprising information about the two unknown heroes yet.
They were parts of the American Tripolis team, and soon as they received a report of the Bangladesh attack, they volunteered to join and with five private contractors spread the road to the area in Bengasia.
The ambassador blames the fact that during that attack, the command was not established officially and overall and simply weakened what to do.
Command commander, so without orders, apparently will release these volunteers.
Everyone does not act one-foldly in the country, but the long-term American order, agents and private contractors are all interesting information.
This is because there has been nothing officially accepted until recently, and it is now only talking about some of the NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States even if halfly try to hit terrorism in Libya.
Although this would want much more help to solve the nationality.
The final place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write today is the coast of Iran.
It's not a long time that the media have sought Iranian air forces to run American drones.
However, it is little known how the Americans protect their drones.
Of course, if the accident is able to discover his drone in the airspace, there is nothing to do with it.
However, the Iranian drone is discovered in the international space, and it is totally different.
So the Iranian airport F-4 Phantom followed the American drone in the international sea space, when it was possible for the first straight upset of the American super raptor F-22 raptor in the history.
The Phantoma's optically checking his weapons, without recording it on a radar or simply observed it, and then when once he appeared inside and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without repeating.
It's not wonderful when Phantom is an American production airport, which, however, remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare Raptor.
We want to show that the Plugin can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a little paradox.
While his team is primarily examining in the last time, the defensor or dealer Victorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to the representation after the year.
He also has shooting shooters, heiring activity, after steps to ́s he has been set up a pick-up in the Teplien.
Victoria sackled in the last two rounds against Slovenia and in Tepliña after victory, but finally took the only point from these two duels.
Frantiszek Rajtoral doesn't want his team to break an inappropriate series with the Jablon.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we're going to hit the template at home," he promises Frantiszek Rajtoral.
The man is prepared carefully for a heavy battle with the North Chechis who play an attackable ball.
Everything intends to go with the model, the trainer makes us well prepared, as we do so many of the video resolution of games supports.
"I believe it's gonna be a great story on Friday evening," the Czechian representative of the fans of the Doosan Arena tribun.
The last ships haven't come out as she wants, but the word of the defense crisis of Viktoria refuses.
So it goes in the bathroom, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis anyway.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again," mentioned the west defense.
Victoria's husband will be back to support fans.
"It's playing on Friday evening, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we'll be grateful to them," adds Rajtoral.
Jana Petita: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step, but a big step - a hopp for a few years of age, and it's in a race, to my childhood.
It's an appreciation for what it was, not to be anxious and just come out of school and kiss the vessels, swimming and doing jobs.
Although these "obligations", it was just the theory, the desire of parents.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, walking the ball into the corner and running out.
Play with the final kids of the ball game, shoot a pancake.
Then, at Helen and her boyfriend's series, exhibit the famous brush for grandmother's birthdays.
And then after some warnings, finally cut this vessel, laughing in the winter, put the tree into the rocks and tasks to do after the lamp (or looking on the partner and instead of the tasks to write the loving verse addressed to the school love).
Tomorrow to feed the household of a marbled (from the actual fruit, not those jacks that are sold now, which the contents of which is not at the eggs or is not) and to drink it with the tea of the dry bilines that we and Mom had so collected.
I'm also taking up the funeral dinner when the funeral was quiet in the room when we played the songs from the sister's house in the cassets that were soundly shooting in the old bathroom after my mother.
And then we moved the boxes on the wallet, and we still left up the same song, our favorite, and they dropped to it with a siphon.
Or we phoned through the table using the phones that were connected to ourselves - and when we were already at that phone to hear better, it was necessary to clean ears reasonably, then the wallet was a sick + vata.
The minimum recompense was more than three times less than it is now, and my parents were able to live so we missed nothing.
We didn't need any of those iPhony, iPady for even the mobile and notebooks or the label clothes.
The clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "protection" in the clothes was baticated household trick using SAVA.
From the electronics, we have enough to satisfy the mother mentioned as well as Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used outside the same way in the train on school.
We've been more interesting to play with Tante Hop or Man, don't hurt, or how I've already brought out "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got under a video player tree, we have certainly watched parents, but, despite all, he didn't play with us.
My younger sister's whispered the shoe, and she was so beautifully packed the cassets, so she tried if she slept and the shot.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last stage.
Well, and this income has still, poor, on a talier from my dad.
She says that when Lenka was small, she'd cut a shot into the video and she thought she was playing a recept and didn't play it, so she couldn't stop it until today.
I'm going to see how we could all communicate together, talk without a mobile, computer.
With my sister, we agreed with my grandmother's neighbor's neighbor's neighborhood on the breakfasts, when we meet again next year with grandmothers -- and that's what it was, that's what it was.
We've met.
Now you promise someone to see you in a year?
I'm also going on the winter when we and the whole village were running out, building snows, riding on a snowed cup at the Church on the snowsheet.
Then, together with the whole family, we talked about the next days.
Of course, we heard the sister before each dinner, the nottoric, known, "Let your hands be washed!"
Yes, it's what's going on today, but you're sure you don't have a bathroom in the kitchen locked mystery on the citrons network.
After dinner, when my dad in the garage "worked" at the beer with the garden of the village, we slept with my mother on the ground, cut off the feet of the rock, opened the door and looked at the flaming and listened to the wood sticks that came from the rock line.
We were closer - right - we did not count how many friends we have on social network, how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated together -- we talked -- we didn't write messages every day through different chats, SMSky.
There was nothing like that, yet we've done much more about ourselves.
And that's how I could continue.
It's beautiful, especially if I add these apples by looking at the album where the black corners are relatively attached to black-white.
And if I didn't know how many times I had, the back of the picture is written in the year of the photo.
I am sure that, even though our sisters did not listen to us according to our neighbors, and we also had a two-number bullet of our brothers and sisters, no one before us, it was so normal (no IN).
And I'm going to go back to the step forward -- to the reality.
By 2013, I'll wait for the modern time to find out one time for my children.
I'm sure that these my ambitions are now for a young growing generation so at least sometimes "100 years after an occupation" and I think they're hoping that they're not going to survive this "success" time too.
I'd like it to them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies are accused of Nortel's patents
The group who owned thousands of patents income to Nortel has made a complaint on Thursday for the violation of patents against the manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, to the company who was in charge of the bankroot of Nortel.
Consorcium Rockstar, who purchased Nortel's patents for 4.5 billion USD, was charged by the American Court of Justice in Texas by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and other four patent infringement companies.
The Rockstar company is in the common ownership of Apple fire, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violation of seven patents.
Patents include Âi, which helps connect the words searched on the Internet with the relevant advertising, indicates the claim, which is a nuclear searching company of Google.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to stop.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work on Google Android's operational system, which strongly competites with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google worked for the patents of Nortel's Nortel's standard price offer 900 million USD.
Google has increased his offer several times and finally offered up to 4.4 billion USDs.
After Nortel was struck by Rockstar in the fight against the patent, he received Google for 12.5 billion USD Motorola Mobility, which was a partly motivated trade by Motorola patent group.
"Despite the failure of achieving a patent that is the subject of a dispute, Google patents have violated and continued to violate," it states in the complaint.
The Rockstar company seeks an increased replacement of damage from Google because it says that it is to violate a patent from Google intentionally, as claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: Laughing November
There's a 4-degrees Celsia, which we've not been used on them yet.
First, she was laughing, the one who still gave her as a defense before friendship.
That's what it's getting too delighted because it was a mask that has decided not to delay public.
He was honest at home only in the days of her grandmother and had her nephew Elinka or Adika around her.
And, of course, when her sons were phoned.
She was very well remembering the lesson from the unfortunate courses of business skills.
Finally, it's been true now.
So that she doesn't make her nearest.
Then he was flying into the corner.
It's like a cross-up.
November, neither another month can't do that miracle to laugh the truth, like when they were on the floor with the one that's not here for almost three years.
Egypt shall enter into the Office of the first freely selected president
Muhammad Mursí has made an ineducational swear, but his triumphal day is only a hard normal political distress in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursí promised “new Egypt” when he was celebrated to the office as the first freely chosen president of this country, after Husjn Mubarak, which was gathered 16 months ago.
When he was introduced to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursí also became the first freely chosen islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the state from the destruction of monarchies about 60 years ago.
He made a swear before 18 judges clothed in black camps in a seat built with a view to Nil, which is at the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek better morning, the new Egypt and the second Republic," Mursi said at the festival of the state TV.
"The Egyptian people today have founded the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursí, a sixty-year engineer studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brothership, a fundamentalist group, which was 84 years ago from its appearance as an illicit organization in the distressed attacks of individual governments.
Shortly after the 11th hour of the local time, Mursy came to a small colony of cars, they kept the building of hundreds of soldiers and police officers.
Only a few hundred supporters came before the Court of Construction to celebrate the President, and at the end of the Presidency of Mubárac, the transport period was only shortly stopped so that the project column could be obviously engaging in a disturbing centre of the city to the southern areas.
The personal pressure of Mursí, mixed as a non-charismistic "reserve" of the Muslim Brothership, has grown from his victory and his Friendly statement, which was intended to present him not only as the candidate of islamists, but also those who want to lead to the end of the rebellion against the authoritative Mubarak.
" Egypt is today a citizen, national, constituent and modern State," Mursí said in a blue community clothing with red corbated judges in a wooden room where he swore.
Mursí post-i went to the University of Kahir, where he had to introduce an in-urational statement.
While he was watching, he received an official welcome from the military capelle, which played a national hymne.
He was the military commander of the field of the master Hussyn Tantaví.
His arrival was carried out by scanning "arms and people are one hand" from the mouth of hundreds of people stored in the main predecessor room of university.
The University in Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secondary education and later in the 70s of the islamic student movements.
Mursy made a symbolic swear at Tahrir on Friday, in the place where a revolution was born that ended the Mubárac authorities, and promised celebrately that the president's authority would be taken again by the military Council, which had taken it from the released leader.
But I agree with the decree of the official oaths before the court, rather than before Parliament, as I usually, he has chosen for the sake of the army, which indicates that the fight for power will continue.
Mursí's manifestation at Tahrir was full of dramatic popular gests.
In the gates, I think they'll be police specialists, the Mayor's pressure
In the Ghetes in Czech, police specialists should be in the future.
They'd have a half of their funeral here.
They'd watch the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge, they should contribute to decreasing pressure between people from poor places and residents from the surroundings.
In his demand to reduce security risks, the Ministry counts inside.
According to the country's improvement, it would help "for the security of social residence".
The document was negotiated by the government.
According to the analysis, it was about 300 poor houses and quarters in Czech a few years ago.
There were 800,000 people in them, mainly Romans.
Adults in gates were without work, families were dependent on doses, children ended in "special" schools.
It was a blow.
According to the experts of the problem sites, hundreds have arrived.
Interruptions between their residents and the finals are exhausted.
In some places, anti-rome travels were made.
The extremists were also added to people from the surroundings.
Inside, there's an emergency for the police with the guetty security and order to keep it.
The primary submission is "the prospectual application of equal access to the demand of rights".
But it doesn't appear to be achieved without a detailed knowledge of places and people.
The specialist would go to the hotels in a ghetto where he would travel to half his service and serve the rest in his area.
He'd watch the order in the problem site.
He would also know local, so he could better solve problems or crimes.
"By the confidence referred to, specialists will easier be able to follow the whole series of anti-local proceedings," said inside.
Specialists in the gates would receive advantages, 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police in the problem is to be played from Norwegian funds.
The start is about 600,000 euros (approximately 15,5 million crowns).
Czechland pays 15% of the amount, 85% of the funds.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed process is processed.
The project shall last until 2016.
The authors were inspired in the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovenia for several years, where the problem with socially disrupted localities is unbalanced above in the CRC.
"There are such called Rome's places," reported the authors.
How many specialists should be in Czechland, not yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that sets places where a special policeman needs.
It will also take care of the amount of money for these staff after the end of the project.
According to the project, first the police's choices are determining the stage in Slovenia.
This school should take five decades of stakeholders annually.
They'll take the most appropriate candidates.
Specific training should also be found for cops who will act in the gates.
According to the authors, it would help to improve social residence.
It should be motivating and leading to integration.
According to the presentation of the inside, there should be three categories.
The minimum standard would comply with the accurate rules, such as the number of persons in the room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards should have social residences that would be comparable to running residence.
The compensators should comply with a plan of integration that would consist of social work with them.
They must keep the living order, care about their health, send children to school, reactive and actively seek jobs.
If they tried to take advantage, they would take place in a higher level of residence.
The system of transitional residence should, according to the internal, operate at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integrated motivation".
Social residence model prepares resorts for local development and work.
To have it until the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Uglary top - one of our youngest socks.
The top of the Uglary is a 3 km south-east copper from Bruntal.
Along with some others, the evidence of self-sufficient activity in the low Essenke is recently (geologically viewed).
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the fourth.
In view of the higher distance, the top of the Uglary top is a widely white, mixed Barock Road Church of Mrs. Marie Help, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the p's tree with the wooden bathroom.
The host that stood near the church wasn't careful.
Shortly after the Church finished, the church was set out from four lines of July, a length of about 1 miles [1 km].
The cross road on the top of Uglgar is already the third version, the pône here remained after 1916, the second, from 2001 only until 2004.
On the fifteen stops, there are wood plastics that prepared the local artist František Nedomlel.
He used different trees from the low Year.
Similarly, the foundation of the hornin from now produces an interesting geological exposure.
The name of the sponsor is also listed on each stop.
The top of carbon is the rest of the young shoes.
Although the data from radiometric measurements are sometimes different, the last eruption here was about 1,5 million years ago.
So he's younger than the Great Redny (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venusina's sopka (age 0.8 million years).
The floor was born by an explosion.
There was a significant quantity of secure pumps together with hornin bullocks from the suburbs that were obtained by the red color.
At the end of this stage the surface of the lava - today it is the layer of a low-speak to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption was your red, red, and places to black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the wall.
In the tubes there are adequate sauce pumps big to 1 meter. The second eruption was administered by the exhibition of lava.
To the end of the activity from the cockpit, a law that produces up to 50 m of the powerful level of the stressed cheese.
The samples which coincide with the exhaustion of the law are the most often type of sope.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they got the name of stratovulcan.
The P's cockpit's cocktail was a progressive erosion.
However, he was threatened to the heavy hornin in the southern side.
The most intense weakness occurred in 1953 - 1962.
The tuffs were added to a beton, which then was easier and had better warmly isolation properties.
The pressure of experts and the public has been able to stop and maintain this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the poority and the small compatibility of the hornin that guards the winds spread and seats down.
Lom's so relatively mixed.
To be more complicated, it is a warm, southernly oriented to the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore a problem, but sometimes it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the top of Uglgar, you will get from the Green Tourist Mark from Bruntal, where appropriate from Slezský Kočov.
Automobilists can use an unpaid parking at the beginning of the lips, where also a short learning path begins.
She moved from the village to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent the most part of life in the činjoy of villa with garden and basen in one of the most beautiful Prague village quarters on Oréchovce.
The owners of the house, however, obtained her back in the refund, and the payers had to move with a small department.
That is why Ivana was looking for replacements for herself and her older mother.
From the known, she received a tip for a apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"Early it was a shock, but looking from the fourth floor to a broad lesopark and resorting to me on the other side," Ivan called on the first point.
First, I thought it would be a provisional for three years.
"We live here today more than 13 years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction," adds the owner.
Mother and her daughter moved from a 100-time apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and all the equipment were divided.
The action was not easy, things were based on friends and gradual installation was almost a year.
The new apartment was totally a good condition, but they had to run necessary adjustments, such as lacking the door or window exchange.
The former owner created a nuclear, but the owner most of them was not practically resolved and unusually large, and the small bathroom.
With two rooms, there was a multilateral resident space.
The architects used to determine individual zones and membership of the sadrocarton room, which enabled new light positions.
By the principle she decided after a few years, the removal of the pool in the residence room was removed.
This apartment has changed to 2 + kk, but the room has reached air, and the panoramic view of the surrounding green has been opened.
Another step to the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC base for laminate.
Ivan's bathroom didn't know the advice.
For years, I took the magazines of living and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting reality.
Thus, I made a recommendation for the youth of Camila Douder.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivan said.
It was also possible to adjust the bathroom to the front of the bathroom.
The architect connected the space of the WC and the bathroom and the two doors with the open wings replaced by one movement that saved the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also quite unbarried.
Quality circuits imitate a sandwich, also a pleasant seat in the pool, in the clothes of a bidet swimming.
Successful cooperation with Kamilo Douder continued.
In the loop of the order How the dream has been built has passed a ≥ but the primary change in the residence room, which also shared in Martin Čeneck.
We had to get three smaller rooms, food, living and space without helping classic principles of optical division, such as half-scale or Japanese walls.
"It would break the openness and the unity of the space in the outcome," explains the point.
It was initially able to separate spaces and residence parts.
It was enough to turn back two shoes and put a box made on the pearl between them.
The food angle is limited to the floor and decorations.
On the ground in the kitchen and the feeding corner used the quality marmoleum, the moved doors lived with a tapet with a pattern.
Cooking angle in the case of needs covered with a tape panel.
The new ground of anti-alergical marmolee has an advantage of the lamination of a series of advantages: weights the insensitive surface without sleep and better sound isolation.
The system of exclusions and views from sadrocarton highlighted colors is a show how to work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the texts, I wanted it to be happy.
"I have a weapon, the same shadow I had in the previous apartment," Ivan says.
The range of graphics with the motive of blowing magnolia is practical and creates a significant esthical element.
For the heat of energy tone, the white that has undergone the modern system.
In the small apartment, books were stored outside and into the space under the window parapet.
Everything's on the lamps, the lamps are comfortablely controlled on the remote.
In the translated entertainment, a new contrast works well with elderly, for example with ten years of old Christian cluster and with qualitative artistic objects that Ivana collects all the life.
The last time the kitchen came.
The boxes were previously placed on both sides, and the owner looked like in the tunnel.
The architect dressed their group and overlooked the location.
The accommodation in a simple design is made on a prohibition, the white surface represents a quiet perlet surface.
In the small room, they were entered by the ideaal solution of the pool, the sugar and the bottle.
The view of a small kitchen survived the overground area of walls over the workpaper.
The unique graphics with a digitally printed motive is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana has chosen the flowers of magnologies that are at her favorite quarter in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here.
In the p's bathroom, there was a small bathroom and a bullet, and in the new owner, he chose a neutrale range of the circuit.
The big corner has a glassed door of Ronal.
The task was to create a simple space in which the equipment and equipment will be harmonised.
Inside, we united materially and colorfully and tried to be his elegant, attractive, not too filled view.
"The next submission of the task was an unbarrier solution with the minimum interruption and the possibilities of easily movement around the accommodation and accessibility of the items of daily need," adds Kamila Douderar.
The Supreme Court decided: Sometimes it can be stuck.
The Supreme Court decided that the former Prime Minister Petra sometimes may be able to deal with the events of criminal acts that could be allowed before the August release of the Missionary Snake.
He was protected only by the process immunity relating to the events in Snavevia.
In the case of former ODS Ivan Fuxi, Mark Šnajdra and Peter Tluchore, however, decided that they could not be disobeyed for the case of criminal offences until they had been delivered to the mandate in November, said the speaker of the Supreme Court of Justice Peter Knöttig.
The Court rejected this decision by the State Representative of Iva Estvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the Members.
They have adopted a payment in the form of lucrative posts in the state firms because they are delivered to the mandate and have made problems with the approval of laws.
On the contrary, the former Prime Minister who offered these posts can continue to deal with them.
With Wit Bart, they also arrested an anti-corupt police officer.
The Bart's council Oldrich Chudob, who also represented him in the case of a particular corruption of VV, also did not want to express too much, but said, "Yes, I represent the customer in this matter, but because of the protection of the emphasis I can't continue to comment."
According to the information Right case will solve the General Security Inspection (GIBS).
The server, etc., noticed that the Bart could buy broken information from the police.
According to a server of recreation.cz, the case could be associated with the case of the former police president of Petra Lessy, whose name to the Bart was evidently endeavored.
The final information of the Right, but shows that the detention of the Witness Barty with Peter Lessy doesn't depend on.
The statement of the police president Eva Kroèč refused to comment on the case of the Prague city representative.
"This question we will not comment on the protection of the ratifieds," she said on Friday, the speaker of the State Representative of the State in Prague, Zenklava.
Just the black complainant observes the matter of the Bart, and thus directly shows that the writing or criminal proceedings are carried out in the procedure of exercise.
Reporter Novinek was able to get the Witness Barty Katrina Classno before their apartment on the Prague Clara.
She just put the kitchens in the car and left.
The whole event refused to disappoint.
On Wednesday afternoon, to the Bart's detention, the Leader of the Moving Leader of Tomio Okamura was drawn up.
The one according to his words doesn't know what it is in the box.
"To know the Bart was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before elections, he was not even a member of the Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamury," he added.
Witness of the Bart, who in the early elections to Snemovna in the Pleasing Country, has failed to candidate for the movement Tomio Okamury's direct democracy, is known to his corruptive casuality of payment of the business of the Publics.
In April 2012, he was irregularly condemned for 18 months with a derogation of 30 months.
Then the sentence was changed and the Bart was approved of the accusations.
Space: with NHL.
I've still got a whistle, a whistle, and a whistle.
For Prospala was a family's first place, so she wants to be completely subjected in her 38 years.
Or he's getting a job in the sea and he's still longing his career, or he's definitely finished with a hoke.
"I want to fill my father's and his wife's role."
"I'm greatly pleased with it," says the hokeist, who still waits for the offer.
Although he's an announced worker who never hurts anything.
Although he leaves his heart every day on the ice, and he can strike it with fellow players.
And too despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Co©us in the past season.
"But the desire of showing all in me is still," he states decisively.
Perhaps it's expected, it's evident that New York Rangers, who's not invited to enter the season, and also have two hurt op. Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan attackers.
How does your arrival look to Rangers?
It's just speculations.
As long as I'm gonna have something on the paper, it's not a price to take care of it.
I know the article in New York Post's newspaper that they should sign me, but it's all.
There was no longer added that the right thing happened.
Unfortunately, I wouldn't tell myself that I had a different thing, but it isn't just that.
Didn't you even respond from the club?
Such communication in NHL is running daily.
It's about getting into the weather when the reality comes.
When the player can't hurt, or it doesn't come to someone, and the manchaft doesn't fall.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come up to the dockromes to get this with me.
But in New York, it's just similar to our situation, isn't it?
Rick Nash is hurt with Ryan Callahan and the team hasn't come into the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, that chance's crazy.
The second thing, but it's that you're two sides on it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I didn't get anybody yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
On Friday, you're going to America, you're expecting that something could just be stuck?
I have the expectation since July 5, when the NHL has opened the market with free players, and still nothing.
Do you want to go to New York to remember?
No, I'm sure I'm going to Tampy for the kids and for the wife.
I'm glad for the sun and for it when we'll see you again.
Have you planned your program?
It's given by my father and husband, and it's all out of it.
Currently I'm not a hokeist -- I don't have a match and I'm not playing a storage.
So I'm gonna fill my dad's and my wife's role and I'm so happy to do it.
You've got two hoke stores on Sunday, that's for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in importers for a full account?
Of course, a person can think about a lot of things.
This can happen too.
I tried it three years ago when I mixed 50 stocks for the operation of the knee.
And it was very funny to me.
Once it's going to be in a stage that all the victories, victories, and guards will not replace you with what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever you have a job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful one could meet me outside the family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: Do you have it so that you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family you want to be in America?
Because I'm hokeist, so in the first place, except family, belongs to sports.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And the family life also takes place.
My kids, so forgiveness, our kids -- my and my wives -- were growing up in the United States, started going to school there and so on.
And we were terrible if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to do, there's the options in America somewhere else.
Such chances should have been offered to them.
So you're planning to stay in America forever?
We'll practice it as soon as now.
That means we're gonna be in Czech in the Deep Bowque and around the Czech Buèvic in the summer.
And in the winter again in the Tamp, or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect, still warm.
I had a great happiness in my life.
It's gonna be said I went against him, it's worth a lot of power and refusal, and it took me a lot of things I've missed.
But the hoke has offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That a woman and I can choose where we're going to live.
There are some people in the world who are seeking this so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How are you going to have in your cup because of dressing, exercising firmly and waiting for the offer?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
I still have it in myself today, this sword, the desire, the sight, the sight of this sport, the desire and motivation to prove people that you still have the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't say how it's still there.
It can't be planned.
So let's say you're waiting for this season, how it's going to go and then you'll decide what's going on?
I'm in the stage when I'm coming a day from the day.
Recently, the Director-General CEZ notified that the decision on the exhibition of the 3 and 4 block of the Electricity Temelin is deferred to the end of 2014 or 2015.
It was expected by the new State Energy concept and the consent of the contracts of the government's difference.
The current leadership of the CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the Government - so for the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give a recommendation to the shareholders, not to hide.

The road official now expects that its annual basic winning before the opinion will be moved between 325 and 340 million USD above 305 to 315 million USD from the previous forecast.
The current development will be maintained by twelve to seventeen percent growth against the record profit of 290,4 million USD from 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre had created eight percent winning in the first half and the second half started with a growth mainly in the Australian and British traveling outside the service road.
"To the date of today, our 10 countries are winning and sometimes refer to recorded annual profits before accounting and deduction," he said.
This belongs to Australia and the Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest winners.
Recreational activities under the second half of Australia have been understood, which compenses a slightly weaker home market with business travel.
Similarly, in Britain, Flight Centre was well conducted in recreation while business clients lost less.
The American trade was lost during a weaker season and expected to bring the third in a series of annual winnings.
The Flight Centre's actions were 3 cents higher at level 38.20 USD yesterday.
Activists of Greenpeace held in Russia transported to Petrohrada
Ecological activists were transferred from Murmanska to Petrohrada from September because of the protest against the planned heavy heat in Arctics.
The AFP has informed this today with the call to the Greenpeace International Ecological Organization.
In addition, it claims that the complaint of its activists from pirateship has not been downloaded yet.
"Greenpeace International learned from the diplomatic resources that thirty men and women, held in Russia after an unusual action against the landscape in Arctic, were transferred from a retail equipment in Murmansk to Petrohrada,” announced the organization in the statement.
D’s movement of detained activists is not adequate; the DPA agency has planned a movement.
Ecological authorities first accused of pirateship, which threatened them to 15 years in the case of the sentence.
The last week, however, they announced that this accusation would be replaced by a smaller exhaustity that threatened a lower penalty with seven years of freedom.
Greenpeace, however, in today's statement, warned that accusations from the piracy of the office have not yet been reached as they promised.
This means that the detention is now charged by two criminal acts.
The Power Committee for Research last week announced that the complaint of pirateship would be replaced by the accusation of exhaustity.
However, when the thirty-professors were held before the committee this week, the accusation of pirateship was not downloaded.
Instead of this against everyone, a new accusation was raised," AFP sensed by the Greenpeace statement.
The Russians held at Gazprom's farm area in half September three ten members of Greenpeace's movement from 18 countries.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, which flies under the Netherlands flag.
Since that time, everyone has been held in the committee to which they have made a revocation, but the court has refused all.
Ecologists are weakening for submination.
The Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, stated today that the move to Petrohrada would easily meet the family and consular work.
However, there are no guarantees that submines in the new procedure will be better than in Murmansk.
"You can be worse," he warned.
The Netherlands King Willema-Alexandra asked for help, one of the reserved activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a manually written letter that has published today the magazine Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch invited to talk about them at a planned meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Malachi has a large share in the renewal of sectoral violence in Iraq, which is, of course, part of the part of fighting in the neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spell and game
At least one Shakespear's game, new of the 19th century, romantic poesia and current British beltria since 1914, will need to simplify at least one hour.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate the deepest reading;
Combined cups of éticas and languages will be canceled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have maturity tests from the language, and they will be encouraged to choose English as an optional subject.
The Ministry of School should issue new foundations for English and Math tomorrow – the first subjects that have radical changes.
The changes will be expected for the next year.
In the single step of the Ofqual office watching maturity tests, it detects changes in the structure of maturity tests, together with the new marking system and the smaller volume of projects for students.
In his announcement, Michael Gove, the Minister of School, said that it was “a wide consensus about whether we are reforming our test system and re-obtaining the confidence of the company” and that it was necessary to take care of the maturity test to be“factory, ambitionary and more furious”.
See shows that Ethiopian schools have less time in matematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than the rest of countries.
To compare schools in Australia, mathematics are about 143 hours a year and about 138 in Singapore.
Although no official requirement for more time matematics, the coalition resources have shown that the comprehensive maturity tests of mathematics – together with a higher focus on this subject in the outlets – will probably encourage the school to promote further learning.
The learning plan will focus more on “the problems of the world”, including financial mathematics.
Island Primator Kajnar: Cancer in CSSD I am not
Before the elections, there was completely burnt a strong dispute between the two wings fighting for the impact inside the island CSSD.
All was exhausted when the primator of the island Petr Kainar returned to court because of the non-democracy building of candidates.
However, the accusations actors did not want to express too much that the party would not be harmed anymore before the elections.
But the voters' voices are now counted.
The leading of the island CSSD so immediately on Monday evening invited the island recipient to come out of the side, and it would obviously be pressed to come about his own.
Peter Kainar wants to fight.
What's going on in conflicts and who's on whose side, he described in an exclusive conversation for the Journal.
How do you have the output of the choice?
The CSSD must have calculated a lot of better outcome.
Did it damage her to have been resolved in the middle of the middle of the middle of the choices?
I'll imagine that social democracy could have a better choice result.
But on the other hand, this corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now.
It's the side who has its internal problems, is internally sick, and people believe that it's not all right.
They gave it in the choices.
What's the internal CSSD diseases?
I think that I have fallen through the ODS for a long time, and the similar things are now playing in social democracy.
It's that the lobbyists, people who expected to find their preventure at the ODS moved to people in CSSD and have their influence on them.
Then it relates to that the police goes after the offices of the island court and collects computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only complied with people who want to be good for all the rest, but many of them think about their own goods.
The CSSD is divided into two imperfect camps and in Prague, as well as in the current war of power between Haskovci and Saturday.
But it was already ready.
What happened before elections in the island was just to know what is now in Prague.
Hasha’s wheel gradually had a position that could then be able to call on the ability to weak Sabbath’s wheel after elections.
The man is in the policy, in which sometimes he needs to access compromises.
Everyone has an internal border when the compromises are not going anymore, and that's my case.
I didn't want to candidate to the sniffle, but when I took the whole thing inside the side, I agreed with Lubosh Zaoralke that I would try to get to the national candidate to strengthen the island's primator just the Sabbath wheel.
Hasha's wheel to it, but it's got a stop.
Why are we standing on the side of the Saturday, not Michala Haska?
I think the Saturday slave is a person who speaks primarily about the CSSD programme and, in a certain way, of visions for the side and for this country.
I admit that I haven't heard anything like that on the other hand.
Michal Hashek's only fighting for power.
I don't understand how the presidentship, which is lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can begin to revoke the President of the Party.
It's a battle for a lot, regardless of everything, and I'm setting up the side.
According to me, what Michal Hashek now has done in Prague, he has completed his political career.
How you realized that the island leader of the CSSD did not accept you to the candidate.
Political parties are based on competition who will be located as their members.
This competition should be based on programme visions and the ability of those people to fill these visions.
Of course, however, in this competition, people who do not have power or visions, but the political party is an extent to money that they would not have anywhere else.
The problem is, when these people continue to reach the front by violating the rules without failure, they violate the statements of the parties.
They do their practices from the political sides of mafia, and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To note this problem is more important for me than to take into account whether the Kainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statements.
Thus, have you made a preliminary action against the likeness of the CSSD candidate in Mo’Suslese country before the elections?
The current periodic Implementing Committee of the CSSD in the Iceland stresses its power by rejecting the organizations that are not appealing to him, by establishing a new organization, gradually exiting the unapproval members of the Party.
For example, they also wanted to throw Richard Bednaric out of the club of representatives, but he made a complaint against it, and then they canceled the resolution on his ra'ia's exhaust.
This shows that the maintenance of the status of the party through the court is the last option, but at the moment when the final ways and control authorities within the CSSD stopped functioning, it is the only option.
The intention of leading the island CSSD in the head of the lawyer Adam Rykala is to call you from the recipient position.
It's a public secret that the master of Poruby Lumir Palyz has a pleasure on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyz are trying to do everything so they can call me back.
They promise people the position, they get the voices, and for those voices they strengthen their power.
When I come back to the past, everything that might have been played around the Banic Island Club and buying Bazaly stadium was just a trial to attack me.
It was an inspired art that they could mark me as a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
Instead, the city bought a property that has a great value for the strategic value.
So how do you see that on your stay in the primator?
The Periodic Committee has already invited me and other people on Monday, and they have considered their residence in the CSSD.
But I think it's like when evil's crying: "Fing evil!"
When we look at the outcomes of my work in the past 11 years, I don't see anyone in the island social democracy who would initiate and prosecute, sometimes and against the members of the party, has developed so many things such as the need for industrial areas or the extension of the park.
Yet, I'm getting inappropriate.
I'm not reading it else than I'm going to stop the final to get to the place they want.
Are you gonna try to fight this?
Because if this Republic has to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to drive the state effectively if he doesn't drive himself.
So I don't think I'm going to leave the CSSD now because I think that the one that causes cancer from this side is not me, but those people who try to scare me.

The dams claim that EUFA is prohibited to publish decision-making punishments.
Dagmar Damk, President of the Commission of Fotbal Association, stopped to publish the sentences for courts.
It is prohibited by EUFA rules, which has been introduced in a discussion for the July Journal.
In other cases, the FACHR would probably threaten the posts.
The Damk also refused that it would be in its side to the Balists of Plzna from where it comes.
These speculations are really insensitive.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the final members of the Commission are elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6, "that Damk reacted to a critic, which was disappointed after Plugin played twice so much penalt than the final ligue team.
Thus, although the FACHR has stopped to publish decisions in the past months, Damk assures that the judges are deceiving their mistakes.
"Troe me that if the Commission finds out that the decision has made a mistake, the delegation will limit him, whether it is in any trouble," Damk said.
For the reasons why the penalties are not published, it is, according to the Damk's prohibition from the European Union.
"The EUFA's publication of such information prohibits and punishes strongly."
"We're very suspicious in us and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the limits, but I got two very significant warnings that if we don't stop, strong sanctions will come," Damk said.
Other countries respect the prohibition.
"We were really an exception," she added.
In order to continue the publication of the information, the Commission would like to be able to get money from the EUFA for education and development of decisions.
"And these are very important for us."
"Unless of them, they couldn't fill the program for the education of decisions," added Damk.
Reserve of the Barty relates to Janouska and Bem: Does it be at the disposal of hearings?
The president of the Witness of the Public Board arrested the police on Thursday.
He was also arrested by the Chairman of the Analysis Committee and the Anti-Coruption Police Jan Petrželek.
Reserve relates to the departure of the lobbyist Romana Janouška and the former primator of Pavla Béma (ODS).
The information about the listeners coming with the server Novinky.cz confirmed the confidential source of the Czech print offices.
The listened telephone talks of Janouška and Bema, which published in March the Juvenile front Today, and in which both men celebrate "Mazanku" and "Colibruk", show the influence of Janouszkov's influence on the stages of the city under the Bem's guide.
The journal noted that in 2007, the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later, had been avoided to the security agency ABL.
That's where he owned the Bart.
Server Novinky.cz warned that the arrested criminal Petrjilek worked before his approach to the anti-coruption police just for BIS.
To the anti-coruptical decree that followed the audience, Petrix passed over at the same time when they were published.
"Watching to the law on the protection of information, I can't even confirm anything," said the complainant Michal Muravski from the Civil State Representative of Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was watching the cup.

The new citizen law is prepared for six fires from ten
The closeness of the new civil law and trade corporation law from 1 January 2014 is intensively prepared for six fires of ten.
Only eight percent of the questioned representatives fired that the matters related to both key codes in their company did not solve.
It comes from the review of the lawyer office of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found the views of 108 Czech fires.
With regard to the close term of both key codes, a number of managers begins to realize the significant impact they may have on their company at the last moment.
The biggest changes in the privacy in the last 50 years will, according to our opinion, be touched by all citizens and fires in the CRC.
As a result of political laviation, the business sector lived in uncertainty whether revolutionary changes would eventually occur or not.
"Now, however, they have only left for a few weeks to go to a new law for their companies without complication," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačich.
From 61 per cent of the companies intensely killed by new laws, 26 per cent indicated that their companies had already adopted all necessary measures to be prepared at times.
For more than 35 per cent of the company of this number, it is intended to take necessary measures at the nearest time.
Therefore, each fifth company has not yet been involved in recodifications, but has a particular idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 per cent has no opinion and the problem is not able to be reviewed.
Only eight percent of the company recognises that the matters related to the recodifications have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal subject relating to the new citizen law is for the largest number of companies concerned for closing new contracts (21 per cent), follows the solution of trade submissions (16 per cent) and further changes in the catastrophe of illegality and in the responsibility for damage (10 per cent).
The contracts are played one of the most important news of the whole recodification, which is the combination of the adjustment of contracts only in the context of the new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in civil and trade law will be avoided, in the result of which the contracting law should be more transparent for citizens and businessmen.
"In the case of businessers, the new adjustment offers many newspapers with a view to the more freedom of organizing relations," warned lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luka Subdit.
In relation to the trade corporation law, it considers the most important theme of the fourth company's problem with the increase in the responsibility of the statutary authorities.
Following the subjects relating to changes in the convocation and progress of the Valid Chrome (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal adjustment means the derogation of obligations and possible impacts on statutory authorities, in particular when the company threatenes or gets into employment.
"In practice, it means that if the members of the representation and fireholders act with the care of the good economy and do not turn back the threatening impact of the company, they can benefit from the performance of the last two years," added Spaihel.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier as a living language

Travels through the water, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages in Camerun.
Bwell and his team easier at least every week of hundreds of patients
In Western Africa, there are not too many doctors; only one of the 5 000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates at the price of CNN Hrdin 2013.
In the competition on the price of CNN Hrdin 2013, you can vote for or for any other of the ten main candidates.
The winner gets $20,000 to continue in his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwell followed his father as he goes back and goes into hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt in 1981 near Camerun Yaounde's main city in car accident.
Earlier, he was treated only with a broken hand, but afterwards the UI developed an infection that spread into the brain, and there he created a hematote that caused the problems of his whole life.
"There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon," Georges Bwell says.
They had to take him out of Camerun when they had money for it.
Instead, Bwell spent years by transporting his father to overflow clinics and hospitals where he got such treatment that was just available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can go out of the house at five, quick to the hospital so you can be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die only because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the change has not changed too much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor of 5 000 people in Cameroon.
Only for comparison, the relationship in the United States is one doctor to 413 people.
And even if the Camerun doctors could visit, many could not allow it.
Two of the five people in this country live under poverty, and at least three quarters of health care expenses in this country are private.
"The only problem that has is poverty," says Bwell.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwell saw his father and suffered many of his countries, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteers' team did the last year free of 700 operations.
He himself became a doctor, but he was a chirurg in the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he found the ASCOVIME neighborhood organisation, whose members on the weekend visit the foreign place where they provide medical care freely.
Since 2008, his group of volunteers has helped at least 32,000 people.
Although each Friday he and up to 30 people are pressuring to the supply, they are getting on the springs of medical needs and traveling a swimming terrain to the villages that care for help.
No. No. It's bringing them happiness.
Sometimes the vehicle must press through the river and the wind.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: guests, songs and dance and the best apartment that the community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is free to celebrate and Bwell — with its wide smile and uncovered energy — is very willing to participate in local joy.
The next day, the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients at each exhibition," says Bwell.
They come to the village from 60 km, and they're the sands.
In each of these weeks, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, sublime, sugar, parasite diseases and sexually transferred diseases.
Others can get white or donated brilliant brilliants or a paper free – a document that requires school, but a lot of godly families can simply be allowed.
The team works under local narcose easy operations tonight.
Operations are usually conducted in the building school, at the officer or at home; after the operation, the patient rises up and goes to their stage to release the next patient.
With light from the generator, the operational rooms and the hygiene Bwell and its volunteers are working in fast wound hours.
It's exciting, but the village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
"And they stayed up and continued working, playing the bubbles all night," says Bwell.
On Sunday, the team's going from the town's rental, slow, but proud of his job.
This group, who attends Cameroon doctors and medical students, has carried out free 700 operations last year and realizes that their aid can significantly mean for local people.
One man said that after the operation, he'd be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
Besides organizing these weekly clinics and the work of chirurgical work in Bwelle’s hospital, it works also tonight for private health clinics around Yaounde.
It states that this second job is actually financing about 60% of its non-request activities; the rest covers private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he actually sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studys medicals at Drexel University in Philadel and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle Group.
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to get money for the organization to make these campaigns.
For medical students and treatment services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwell to his mission, it is a great practice they would not get home.
"Doctor Bwell's hands were accurately cutting and removed blood curves or we kept his tools," O'Malley says.
You will never live as a medical student in the second year of America.
The students of volunteers usually pay their way to Camerun and often come with the provided medical needs.
But when he comes to Yaounde, he gives them food, transport and study Bwell.
"It's no doubt a hero," O'Malley says.
This organization gives his life and his desire to help the people of Camerun is unnecessary.
For Bwell's constant demand, it's not a burden.
To help others live more happy, to fulfill the promise that he gave his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I'm doing this job," Bwell says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
It's the reason why I'm doing it to deal with people, to refresh their pain.

Minister Holcát renewed Hla's sisters for the CR
Claims for the CRI should represent the interests of health sisters whose level in Czech is over 100 thousand.
"I think it is essential to define and formalize these issues to have the health sisters of their representatives in the structure of the Office - representatives to whom they can return in the case of need," explained Martin Holcát, Minister for Health.
I appreciate my sister's work and I think that the work of treatment is deserved to be denied by the Ministry.
In the execution of this call, not only high professionality, but also human access and personal convictions should be high.
"I'll be pleased and with all my responsibility to try to promote the steps that can improve the position of health sisters."
"We have excellent and nice sisters in our health, but I would like to call on those colleagues who are not too helping us with their access to patients to perform their calls with all empathy and help us improve the picture of the sister in the public," says Alena Schmidava.
The newly called Hla's sister for CR Alena Schmidava, at its opportunity to introduce to ́a, also stated that it wants to work with the most different aspects of the works of the sister’s health and that it is appropriate to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical calls and doctors.
"I don't really want to separate the vocation of doctors and sisters, but I see them standing near itself, while everyone has his own competence and together with other health works makes a very great job to provide health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I alone meet a number of problems that comes out when the sister calls, these hatreds, and I decide to participate in their solution."
It includes, for example, a simplification of the treatment and health documentation.
"From my own experience, I know that some administrators of the works of the sisters are unfortunately harmful and take time to them that they can and should have ra'i to patients," Alan Schmidava states.
Otherwise, it includes improvement of workshops, searching road to better cooperation in the team and management of health providers, adjusting competences and also working legal issues, such as keeping the law of work or disturbing their sisters inadequately in the time and place.
We often hear anonymous paths, which, however, are not documented in a specific case in which the violation of the rules could be affected.
"Where there is no complainant, there is no judge, and so Hla's sister CHR could in this case serve as a guarantee for the preservation of anonymity of such a complaint and a specific case to allow the competent authorities to check," Alan Schmidava concluded.

No political parties are members.
I don't want to hate.
The writer Václav Kahud returned to writing after twelve years.
After long years when he read, he lived, but did not write, he issued VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) the new Roman Wind, dark, presentation.
That it is not a close link, a number of parties is comparable to its most famous share of Houstin (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another distinct Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What happened when you wrote Roman after twelve years of silence?
I did it -- so I didn't hate myself.
Seeing around yourself still new and new clones of human infection, young organisms achieved by blind selfish effort.
I don't even speak about us older ones, the kits ruined by impotence, the wexlative soul, and the opposite of the ideologists who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a small sales girl.
At the beginning of the thousands of years, I bought a little digital camera and bought my juridic friends, stupids, and fairs.
It's over me.
Sometimes I feel how my brain burns from my life on this planet.
Well, I'm going to walk and then I'm reading the book last night.
You're talking about the feeling of death, hate.
Was there somewhere in the past a crash that affected you, or are you even older like us all?
It's been breaking a long time, about 10 years old.
That wasn't the name at that time.
Well, and I lived after that.
There's somewhere in there, but there's still a surprised silent boy.
I see any other solemn kids, everyone in his tournament of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I will participate in this invasive, thousands of years of the continued movement of the life system on this planet -- this division of the incomprehensible future.
That immortal, breath of the basic complexity of life, when every stone is the direct inheritance of our presence.
We are players quiet and beautiful games when the trip-omyl road produces another and another generation of being, which in billions of interactions per second creates an overlid, artificial intellectual.
Twelve years are relatively long.
Do you consider your writing as a current process, or have you started completely from zero?
The self-speaking, or better spoken dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes runs to cold and forms it in the book.
Like the period of peace, there are silent metastases of wars that may be awakened one day - my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt that no life's lava grows in my brain, and if I don't do anything, I'll be silent on one day.
It's a file of questions that the brain has formulated and puts it to the levels that are stored in the darkness "below the level of the domain".
Neokortex, green brain cow, ask for elderly evolutional creatures, goes to ancient brain tree aircrafts.
He speaks to the crossed beasts, he asks serpents, he looks for an answer in the flight of birds, he brings his eyes to the darkness of the cloud.
Yes, the law is in me and the star heavens on me.
Finally, the brain is asking the world.
Relatively often, you're exposing to the metaforic gue - could you definite it biologicly?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical links all experiences, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This boss of logic and emotionally exposed and emotionally exposed and with information trees, memory records, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, it is expressed increasingly variable presence, trys to name and understand its environment and decodes an important communication.
Sometimes there will be a disorder.
Analogics - as if you "sleep" PC, from the language emulator program and other language translators, you would first get in operation, for example Windows, and after some failure restarts, you ended in the darkly green screens of Bios, in a basic system that drives and works on the matboard, between the processer and the operational memory etc.
For those who haven't yet understood what it is - I'm talking about psychospirital crisis.
You're talking about her often -- why is this type of return regularly interested in you?
Because it's jama.
In the posterity of the mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, there will be an emergency.
Here's good to feel Netzsche: "So he looked in the destruction when the destruction looked at him."
It's a risk of feeling - that a person's lost if everyone disappears on ́e, mentally "dead" and comes to a new quality.
And why is that personally interested in me?
I'll answer the parable.
When one fell into the darkness, he was warm, running days, months and years, he was still warm, and he read, and the books taught him to flood, so to live.
He's become a fucking bullet.
I hope that somebody will help my writers, as sometimes helped me the Hrabal's texts.
In what way do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
The one who can't say anything meaningful about, one calls it aside, another super eeg, but I think it's the best characteristic of Arthur Ribaud in a friend's letter:
"I am someone else -- this reader shares directly in the formulation process."
From the early youth, he read the books of old Czech pounds, shiped in the poorce of No, running after Stinnadleh in dark halls.
At the same time, after all the authors and their message, it sounds: "Sunce is the world of other Karla Hynka Machy."
What if the book is outside?
Do you care about the reader view?
On the back reflection that will get to you through people who will read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred coroners and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe after years, they contact me in the street and thank me for helping them my book in their hard life decision.
The books are "life" or "the worlds".
They are encoded in characters of letters, wear experience, history of regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life when we let their feelings go into the brain.
It is actually, in its way, something prohibited of divine -- to wake up more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the DNA which is stored in line -- according to the old demonological books, we're starting a magic.
After the book delivered you -- how it was -- it's waiting for the copy reading string.
I remember you've ever read.
You're going back to it with joy, or do you feel it different in years?
That's what I'm gonna tell you about today.
And what did I find out with that?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're inappropriate, they're not too advising themselves, they have friendly exhibition, you don't feel alone with them.
I'll give an example - in the city of the Red Church lived (and I hope he still lives) one nice bookbuilder (that is appropriately called Juvenica), a happy companion and a good girl boy.
At one piattice, he presented me the individual articles of my book Houstin's readers.
I was looking for them in their eyes, and then he was shown to me a broke, reading copy of my book.
I've just put a divorced morning and I've shortly wept a man.
We've all been there, we've been kidding up, and we've been drunk with a shot.
Then the young blonde mixer didn't stand up and sprang out the head from the window to the snow hang.
It was in the land.
We went to the night country and took a happiness of sensors, the painful soul of the landscapes and the steak of the falling properties -- we broke and smoke like vulcationers to ́na.
Each of your books is formally different from the previous.
Is it also payable for the wind text, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a conviction about a country after nineteen rivers and nine hours.
Ivan Bunin in his new Sokodol places in the mouth of human treatment the words of an old Russian bath: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
It's a dog, it's a blue box on it.
Fear, trembling, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Perhaps we had been devils in the hell ago and lost - what role we will play in this land.
Are you worth keeping writing, or do you leave it again on a free inspiration influence?
The answers are covering - Brisbane Island.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
What a huge and insignificant, similar movement of continents on the planet affects our desires from such deepness and in such a width that it overcame our view - and thus, with complete self-compliance, we do exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by dopamin, endorfine mixture and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to park, die in defence and obtaining new personal territory.
Sometimes there's a disorder, and we're gonna be feeling sensitive.
Only then we have the right to call people.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of different disorders, standing on the coast of the unconscious ocean and taking the influences of the wheat in the wooden floor made from the spine copper.
I have to write to be a man.
Obama comes from health care
After a long criticism, President Obama left his frequently repeated and ambitional promise yesterday that "when you like your health programme, you can leave it."
With the revocation of hundreds of thousands of notices from the Providers in recent days, the President was accused of claiming the American public.
Obama's yesterday discharged from his handful promise.
"The majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can leave them," he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of what he called "distortion in media", Obama invited Americans, who received this announcement, to search for new market challenges.
Most people will be able to have better, more complex health care programme at the same price or even less than it was assumed.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administrative claims that it should not be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be proposed to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Law on Availability.
"I say this to those Americans at the level: you deserve something better," Zebelius said in his speech before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, watching the implementation of the Law on Available Care, said that the launch of the Internet market was “poor” from October.
"I'm disappointed and injured as all the finals," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The Sebelius's undertaking, captured by a locked microphone, yesterday said to the adviser at the Committee's yesterday negotiations, which had been held after a storm exchange of opinions with the Republic of Billy Long, the representative of Missouri, who had to be involved in the Obam's care programme.
More than three hours during the hearing of Sebelius, he repeatedly questioned why the "architect" Law on Available Insurance was not voluntarily granted to the Government of sponsored insurance, and did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now offers millions of Americans.
Which billioner will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both business firms have confirmed and, according to the most different resources of the Agency and of the bullet, the hand is already in the hand.
The transaction notice should be made in November, probably before the start of the frequency for the LTE network, so before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komarek own KKCG group.
This has been allowed under the label Sazka Telecommunications to get to the frequency for the LTE network.
And this, for a general surprise, has not been talking about the shot of the company to get into telecommunication until that time.
But Sazka now leads a very experienced telecommunication boy Robert Cvatal.
He started as the marketing leader of Radiomobile (the T-Mobile Today), and then became the director of the Slovenian T-Mobil, and afterward, the Russian band of the same operator.
She's just playing a few cards once.
She's logged into the phone, and now she admitted that she wanted to start the chair at Vodafon.
And he gives it a logic.
It will succeed, so it will be able to move already existing clients from its own own operator.
This would probably not like the normal circumstances of Wodafon, but according to the financial news, it may be a part of a much greater cooperation with both fires.
Vodafons are currently suffering by the agreement of competitive operators O2 and T-Mobile who will completely share their network.
Wodaphones are so partners.
And that can just be Sazka.
This has been successful in the LTE network (as a newer can carry out specially designed spectrum), so Wodafone does not need to run in any case, respectively to lead to the extracting of a spectrum only (not enough of frequency for all).
The waterphones can share with Sazka on the network.
Waterphones leave Sazka in their 2G/3G network (respectively newly built LTE network at frequency 900 MHz), which enables the company to start the network.
The rate between this is to build a LTE cost network that will be able to use also Vodafone.
Both companies can be happy.
Then the funds of the Watafons could lose a strong internet provider or a cable TV.
And Kellner?
The purchase of Czech and Slovenian O2 (the Slovenian bathroom is a daughter of Czech) would immediately obtain a full-valuable operator with a continuous profit and a wide offer of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big molecule that's gonna wait for restructuring.
The LTE network would already get Kellner for O2 and most likely with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already been able to share the network.
The Aukce could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the State is pleased to budget.
And since the next year, customers in Czech could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Comark.
Or two Czech Business Titans against global areas.
Will the Czech TV sometimes go out without signing actions?
In the era of the president of Zeman, it has passed a legendary scene with a farmer, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that broke the documents of the prosecution of the building family.
In the past, the traditional effect of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Trddika did not document such a document, so that it would be signed under it.
True, leaders have become editors.
However, the cases described are not answered to the question from where such accommodation of some journalists to the country is taken - whether it is response to direct negotiations, or not, and they did not use vulgarism, typical improper empathic coincidence.
And when we assume the general disappointment, we cannot forgive the question whether the changes in television are not affected by other, at least without scrupulous power interests, which have not yet been available.
Those who say it is true that in developing countries there is no attempt to send policy intervention.
However, the truth is also that it does not mean that there would not exist complaints on public media.
The trainers do not doubt their independence.
Instead, they criticize mainly what they consider as a trend that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this is not with us.
But it may also be in the country that thinks of itself that there is the most corrupt worldwide, black and white stories of bad politics and good news are more satisfied than complexer descriptions of invisible descriptions, in which many imperfect human beings will be conducted.
JAN JANDOUREK: curse of this country: Presidents in the field of force
It is almost the rule that at key moments the country has not been the head of the State in such a way to be able to carry out its state obligations.
If T. Masaryk was physical and mentally in five years older, he would have reached the end of his presidential period and events around Mnich would have played a little different.
They probably did not win the war, but after a symbolic opposition, the aircraft could fly out of the border, hard weapons have been destroyed, and the government could go to London right now and take care of its legitimateness.
And primarily, it would not have a nation of cocovine to this day.
Benes wasn't the Stateman, and he was still in concision after Mnich, but in the war, he started to go out of the coat and held it in February 48.
To be about something better, he could go third to the exile and submit the legitimateness of communists and their shoes.
Hah's damage to talk.
They chose him with "Mr. President will not get to the decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision with Hitler's knife wasn't supposed to be in the office.
In the last days of March 1939, the leader of the scientist Frantiszek Moravec said what everything should be done so that the occupation that he had made on the day did not pass the Germans so coldly and with such a winning.
The Senior President and the white government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
Godwald’s people's care was allowed to repair his older co - co - co - co - co - co - co - co - case, as Moscow told him.
The man of freedom was definitively disappointed by the part of normalization, and they had to gather it, already completely senile.
That Husák was an unfortunate and sick depression and the elder of the event in November 89 made it easy, but that's the only step.
Havel was lucky not to meet him in the office last years, he was saved from the worst.
Although Klaus is still fresh tennis dealer, but many of his resources can realize that thought processes are no longer what they were.
Well, now we have this here.
The head of the State and the commander of armed forces looks like it looks, and we don't have anything to do.
Unfortunately, there is no threat to the external threats of the Republic now.
Or maybe it's threatening, it's not just that way to see.
The question is, then, whether it is not exceptionally (historically) well that the President is not completely in force.
It's not normal.
Couldn't you choose a president in this country once again a person acceptable and acceptable healthy?
Remote planets, black-white movies, or a little fantasy on alien life on the earth are not the subjects that the American jazz saxofonist Wayne Shorter would be on the airport.
In the capture of his quarter, which on November 6, in the large hall of the Prague Lucerny ends the annual structural festival of the underground, which is all related to all.
The party of the jazz saxofonists Wayne Shortera are current musician feelings.
According to his task, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they just do.
They are accessible to music as a whole improvised room business and think about harmonization or ritme, but in film images.
This principle, however, is eighty-eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, nine Grammy wearer, sometimes Milese Davis, and today the biggest lived jazz saxofonist explains unpleasantly.
He does not talk too much about music, although his overall view of life with music is closely related.
In my 80 ’ s, I realized that the best thing is to let life surprise.
"Too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things are developing differently," Shorter says.
How the whistlers from Thailand brought up the markets of Paris bar
Perhaps you're crazy over the wheat, and then you don't realize that about a half kilo per year you're totally voluntarily sounding.
For example, he was killed in the mouth.
You'd consume it in a house, then you're uniquely trends: it's ecological, survival, and you've also experienced a single effect.
He ordered a shopping offer as the first in Paris to his business's eating paper at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, kitchen and bar owner Le Festin Nu.
Bar, for whom the name was the inspiring book of William Burroughs Nay dinner, you would find in the modern 18th district near Montmartru a lot of visited tourists.
With a fresh avocade, cutting red papriks, swimming and swimming, the new guests can be cut off, not only different larves, cowles or water browses, to prepare for the shoes.
Careful and specially packed supplies (for the wheat not to hurt the wings, not to break the feet or not to damage the eyes) they send Daviron to Thailand.
Europe's first learning to eat honey, otherwise it's running.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pop-up menu indicates just a few of them why to consume just a hmyz.
Their ecological benefits are because the production of smoke is much less costful for our planet (which is financing, space and water consumption) than for the traditional meat.
"Besides, it's a wonderful source of protein and 3 mass acids," said Daviron for Reʹs station.
Besides, the young kitchen will not stop his profession, he simply claims to offer his customers a single culinary performance.
According to it, it makes a proper restaurant of joy, feeling of sin and atmosphere.
"I don't save the world, I'm just making a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone else would probably come to an idea of how it consumes the bridge of decorated fish, but the reactions of the Paris bar clients to the served wheat are, according to the owner, very positive.
Even skeptics are finally encouraging, even when they start with the smallest systems and then choose scorpion.
The prices of these degustation balls shall be moved from five to nine euros.
President of Svazu businesses in the building in CR Václav Matyja: New Green Suspensions should continue
Since 2008, the Czech building has continued to decrease the volume of the prohibition and is not interested in the State to solve the investment exhibition problem.
The report of the New Green Resistance programme was a positive signal for our building, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, following the implementation of the measures, will reduce significant amounts for exhausts, but also opportunities for building companies and building materials.
Each billion invested will bring to the State more than 2700 new jobs created.
In view of the State's fiscal policy, the impact of the packaging and multiplication is also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of businesses in the building in the CRC is essentially unconcorded with the resolution of the Government and requests the implementation of steps that would enable further continuation of the programme so that further challenges could be stated in it.
FAVO, 1 November 2013
The dog shrinked a cowberk, the president shot and ended on the Berlich
President Milosh Zeman left the motoline hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed, and went to the lock in Lánach.
What kind of health is it?
In an unprecedented recognition, John Kerry said that the American spinner "she went too far"
John Kerry noted the defence position of the United States on its follow-up programmes and in an unprecedented acknowledged that, in some cases, the spinage “has gone too far”.
The Minister also recognized that Barack Obama and Barack were responsible for the fact that they acted as a "autopilot" in view of the famous discovery of the NSA spending activity, which appeared thanks to the informator Edward Snowden.
The information published has led to diplomatic storms between the US government and its associations.
Mr. Kerry's video-communication to the opened government in London said: "It is no doubt that the President and I and the rest of the government have learned about some things that were done from the maintenance because this option was, with reference to the Second World War, a difficult period of cold war and, of course, on 11 September."
So he became the first highly established member of the US government, who admitted that the American Spain had overcame the border, but emphasized that no rights were violated.
He said, "In some cases, it came too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and explain it to people, and he now conducts a reasonable review so that no one feels that it has come to disuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not in use in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that NSA organisation is seeking good and that its follow-up operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We will fight the new world in which people are willing to depart from themselves.”
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is firmly decided to kill and remove people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In Vestian, we prohibited not the aircraft, the buildings were not exploded, and the people weren't corrected because we know about these plans forward.
The president of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs on Thursday said that American legislators want to go to Europe to respond to the fears of anxieties related to the American spinners, and they convinced the Europeans that they should continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke with members of the European Parliament and other persons and that he was concerned about their disappointment to stop terrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the follow-up of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the United States' national security interests, it is important that Europe remains with us on one ship, and in view of the common efforts to combat terrorism, he said in a discussion from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the president of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs.
And I'm going to Europe to show that we must continue working in the fight against terrorism, despite their speech over NSA programmes.
The media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, distorted the relationships with some American associations, although the head of the Agency this week said that they were inaccurate and reflected the incomprehensive metadata that NATO associates collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery was the documents expressed by Snowden that NSA followed the mobile phone of the German officers Angely Merkel and other 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Rapporteur James ́pper spynage of associates was as necessary and said that it was a matter of both sides.
Murphy said that his office plans a parliamentary road that should be successful this year, and he hopes that members of both sides and rooms in the delegation will appear in the delegation.
The following days shall be published, namely, by the final legislators who are willing to be involved.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the road was to help make relations, he added that they would be prepared to “not reduce educational measures”.
He said that European leaders must be respectful to their own people about the Spain programs they use themselves after year.
"Although we have managed our monitoring programmes and have better protected European rights, they also have to realize that we are not the only ones who run a spionship here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is planning this weekend to the Middle East and Polish to respond to the immortality that has already been called for the American Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the American monitoring activity.
Australia has been revoked against residence in Thai negotiation
A 11-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15-day divisions on the island of Phuket, when she falsely claimed that she was attacked by the taxi driver, she rejected the verdict and was released on the cooking.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was charged on June 15 by the Earth Court on the island of Phuket from a wretched accusation when the Thai police said that the taxi driver and two other men who were arrested it were attacked in the early hours on Sunday 10 June.
However, the records from the industrial television later discovered that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The police of the island of Phuket had conversations with Bamford two days before she learned she invented an accident.
It was held at local police target before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a fixed facility with low care on the periferia in Phuket, rather than to be placed in a contract for adult women.
He's a daughter of the former australian ligue player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter asked to help the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph Sydney's letter that the whole family had "external concerns" about her daughter's judgment and wanted her back to Australia.
"Obviously this is an emergency period, but we hope that it will return to us as soon as soon as it is safe," Tunks said.
Bamford revoked the judgment and was released on the cooking of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia’s reports, she has spent a permitted recreation in the Crab in South Thailand.
Some resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was representated by the local lawyer in Phuket, but it was warned that the revocation could lead to a judicial procedure that its penalty increased and distorted in the location of adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian employee's journey to the office of Michelle’s office in Phuket, Thailand may also try to make a broke picture, which may have just been behind a liberating verdict.
Iger shot: Goll with a bridge?
In the defence bar, he got a puck, and no one got it anymore.
Moreover, the outcome changed after a forehend call.
Jaromir Yagr so scratched against Tampha in the midnight, on Thursday evening after 119. Victory in NHL walked on the Facebook social network.
"When I looked at this video, my agent Peter's freedom answered the director of the Czech Dragons and asked him if I wouldn't have to make advertising on their most modern impact Pendolino!" he wrote on an introduction with the Jeager.
We think we're typically very similar.
I'm probably gonna have to finish with night trains so that I'm not going anymore.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defence could then call and want to make an advertising on the tissues!" he added a smile.
In addition, New Jersey wrote another victory in order.
"And mainly, you have noticed - the treatment of Mary Rottro is taking away," Jagr closed.
Instead of the allowance of the luminous luminous allowance gula
Royal elections better than the winners brought a bathroom of vulnerable people.
They are not only the parties who have not been in the Missionary offices (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous Government party (ODS, TOP 09) and finally also the CSSD because of their internal division.
The politicians have served our weekend a license gula instead of the festival.
The choice-shopping became the movement of Andrea Babische, which promised the electors to change the existing political rule of government.
The dilution of electoral outcome and division on the victory side is a political (z) due to President Miloshe Zeman, notwithstanding the desires of electors who have not been supported by the party that President Zeeman has publicly supported nor has been allowed to be a vote.
Although the President has lost a strategic step from the final policy because of an inappropriate event, he remains still a few ways to get it back - for example by choosing the future Prime Minister.
While the CSSD's chances of getting the primary chair in my eyes are remote, the company Andrei Babiš's nearby.
Although the optional development is still far away from the fast and hot creation of a stability government, but in comparison with the preferential scenario of the CSSD Left Government supported communists, this is the development of undertakings in the CRC and therefore the economy is just a better report.
In view of the ONU's voice resistance, the ODS or TOP 09 is still the most likely variance of the CSSD, the United Nations and the CDU-CSL coalition (total of 111 cases).
In view of the range in the CSSD, which has become an unreadable and weak party in the negotiation, the results of the coalition negotiations may be sufficiently relating to the CSSD.
The Minority Government of the CSSD will probably not pass on the Garden.
Furthermore, any government to which the CSSD will be shared will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitious ambitions of many social democrats that can lead before or afterward to the next division of the side.
So I ask myself, "Will we not contribute to the other previous elections?"
Other options would be more than referendums on the force of the United Nations election mandate.
The CSSD plans for the establishment of sectoral taxes, the significant increase in taxes from income or the construction of the State bank have fallen under the board.
The Parties of the CSSD, the United Nations, the CDU-CHSL and the Implementation will, in contrast, be coherent with business support, coherent fiscal policy (regular deficit under 3% of the PIB), supporting disapproval of employment, reducing the DPH lower rates in the selected goods.
Three areas are most available in view of the social policy and size of the state.
ANO has a proposal now, so the program is still the most likely ANO, CSSD, KDU-CHSL would be more transported.
What I think is, finally, better outcome than the Left Tax Programme for everything that is still going on in the economy.
