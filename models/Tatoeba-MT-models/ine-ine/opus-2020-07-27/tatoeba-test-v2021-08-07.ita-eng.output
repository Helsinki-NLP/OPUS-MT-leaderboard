white pedone at f3, black pedone at e6, g4, black female at h4 - mad shock! This is sharkly indicated in the scachistical circles as "shock mad".
White: Tower in a1, pedone in b6, kings in c8. Black: pedons in a7 and b7, kings in a8, alphirs in b8. The White places the opposite in the Zugzwang to the tower in a6, since the Negro has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his alfier in any other shack on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes his pedone forward from b6 to b7 and gives mature shock. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black piece in a7, with the same result.
