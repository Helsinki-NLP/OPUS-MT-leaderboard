Boss of the United Nations states that there are no military solutions in Syria
General Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "no military solution" in the conflict that lasts nearly five years and more weapons would do only to appeal to violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Boss again requested all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban declared Wednesday during a conference that it intended to meet this month with foreign ministers in five permanent countries present in the United States, Russia, China, England and France, at the border of the Ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed the regret that divisions between the Syrian people and the regional powers " did this unresolved".
Ban requested the five remaining members to prove solidarity and awareness when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, taking into account the crisis in Syria.
8 numbers of surveys showing that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a political "flip-flop".
Others called him a crap.
And others's awake the implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to give Donald Trump from the top of the surveys, it has not worked (a.k.a.).
Ten of the last 11 national investigations have argued that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two numbers and some voices begin to wonder seriously what this means for the chances of name of the immobile mobile.
Of course, it's still too premature.
Nobody of all this says that Trump will win the course for nomination of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was held to Herman Cain in investigations, but no one of them won in any state in the nomination course.
And the reasons for the general choices are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservator Club for Growth admits Trump's power and begins to support it with money.
We continue to present you a few numbers of recent surveys that suggest that the immobile motor is not just something traveling:
The numbers indicating support to Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidature in the middle of June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of the immobile movie.
In the middle of July, the percentage went up to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion on Donald Trump.
About three of the 10 states that they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are kept.
An investigation carried out last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republics in the region had a favorable opinion on Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP's would be happy if Trump would win the nominal course.
A survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said that it would be "entuziasmate" or " Thanks" if Trump would win the nominal course.
Only two of 10 state that they would have been "soft" if Trump would win the course for nominalisation.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% states that it would be "entuziasmate" towards 40% that declare the same thing about Trump).
The nearest about enthusiasm?
Mark Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the republicians show that they would be "ingrate" or "separated" if the Jeb Bush favorite wins the course for nominalisation.
The Republicans' ability does not consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his administered insults and its bombing style, 52% of the national republicians believe that the real estate power has the right temperature to be president, according to the review carried out on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We have the same numbers in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans think Trump has the personality possible to be leader, according to the investigation carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are thinking that it does not have the personality necessary to act effectively and almost six of the 10 individuals show that his temperature does not have what is looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
But the republicians are habitual with the idea.
When I take the intellectual attitude, the Republicans think Trump is.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most chances to win the GOP nomination course, four of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed towards the end of July, when four of 10 would have appeared to Jeb Bush.
Complete information: in the past, GOP's people haven't read the future very well.
At the same time of the last elections, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the course of nomination, about 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP electors considers Trump's campaign eligible.
Even if the Republicans or replied to another candidate, Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some votes say that the dividedity will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey from the University of Monmouth at the beginning of September shows that, in the hypothetic cooperation between Trump and the majority of the others candidates, Trump will nearly always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located at 13 points from Carly Fiorina, at 14 points of Marco Rubio, at 15 points of Walker, at 19 points of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would win the man with 19 points in a hypotetic contrast one to one.
Donald Trump's supporters' responsibilities claim that they have decided.
A new CBS/NYT survey shows that over half of those supporting Trump states that it does not change its vote option.
Obviously, there can be a lot in this sense, and no one can say that they will never respond.
46% appears that they leave ports disable the possibility to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opposite is currently the Neurochirurg Ben Carson, but it is two times more like those who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump in immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants in Mexico "violators" in his campaign discovery speech, two months ago, the immigration was the central subject in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombing style will lead to a divorce between the important Spanish and the Republican Party and will judge the efforts of rebranding.
However, according to the survey carried out by ABC/Post Monday, six of the 10 Republicans are agreed with Trump in the issue of immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the problem of immigration is in reflectors, Doland Trump will also be.
The frustration towards the authorities touches new culms.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republicans, mostly due to their status of outsides.
According to the survey carried out by ABC/Post Monday, six of the 10 Republicans have been shown that they prefer a political outsideside in the detriment of a person with experience.
People are also subject to the authorities in Washington.
A survey in Iowa two weeks ago by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the CONgres Republics, 54 per cent, declared "insolent" and 21 percent "nerwoid to the cow".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Ministers
Since his choice, Mr. Corbyn to PMQs has been advanced.
The new leader of the Laburist Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make its start at the Premier Minister's ́ons, faced with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions which he has right to shortly after breakfast; his performance will probably be analysed almost by the media and the labour parliamentary.
In the weekly appearances, he asked “mince theater and more facts”.
He also declared that it could refuse to participate and that it would be given to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn in the position of leader, coming after called a "fantom" cabinet and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC conference.
In time, the leader of the Laburist Party to keep silence in the news of the national name within a work held on Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of England Battle, took criticism from a conservative parliamentary and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national name took attention
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn stated that he “kept silence respectfully” and repeated“British Air Forces' eroism in the Batallia of England”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's fantastic cabinet, Owenith, declared for the Two's Newsnight transferred by BBC that he would have recommended to the laburist leader to sing the "independent" national name of his faith that the monarch should be abolited.
About twelve ministers in the fantastic cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences in economic, air and external opinions, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political co-respondent, Robin Brant, states that political differences are "compulsed" in the Laburist Party after the name of Mr. Corbyn on its position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Laburist Party will bring out initiatives through which the idea of limitation will be completely removed.
A few hours later, Mr. Job Minister and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in a position towards the plans to reduce the level of "cap" from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth laboratory leader of David Cameron at the court in the last decade since he has taken the leadership of the Conservator Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different policy approach, says that he has the ideas of "external sources" for questions to address Mr Cameron and that he received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North believed that PMQs included a too high level of opposite and that it will remain from replies and attacks, engaged in exchange of serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges to young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister for Finance, will keep the place in PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron moves foreignly.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the word occasionally, saying that he had addressed the President of the Chamber of Deputy John Bercow to discuss this aspect.
In 2005, when he took the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wanted to revoke the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but renewed a few years later that he did not succeed in his debt.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometry of the reasoning of a leader, the way it leads to the House of Members and its position within the Parliamentary colleagues, although criticisms have become a cargo and need a deep reform.
“Qadro in Joburg”: Youths without appeal benefit from photo curses
It's difficult to be a man without appeal in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a message and win their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit study that teachs youths without a chance to make photos of areas where they live and win money from this.
BBC News met one of the first resolvers of the project.
Boss JD Sports says the biggest salaries could make extension.
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in the minimum loan in the United Kingdom could mean "a greater purchase power in the potential buyers".
However, this purchasing power is at least likely to overcome the larger costs for work in the company, it is.
The costs could have an impact on JD Sports expanding plans, added it, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a co-side victim in the "fortuna" created around his friend, Nick Kirgios, and his behavior deserves more loving words and not critical, in view of President Tennis'a, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the most talented part of the two of the "Special Ks", was lately unpleasant in reflectors by the scandalous departure that Kirgisian had before Stan Wawricka at the Montreal Masters tour.
A shortly played mechanism, in Ci ́innati, the throne arbitrum had to intervene twice to split Kokkinakis and his adversary Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground, and I should have put it on the ground on this boy."
Although it was seen last time making a dust racket after he had muscle cramps and wrapped a possible US Open tournament, suspected by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly shot by Healy.
The adolescent is now in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the two places in individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Cupe Davis against England.
"A thing I feel strong is that, after I looked, Thanasi was a little in conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broken a racket when he lost because he was accused of cramps in the US, but he is not the first player who breaks a racket of frustration against himself and knows Thanasi enough well to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, it's been very well-handed in the rather provocation in the US with Harrison and so far, and I think it deserves much confidence.
He's got a extraordinary team, he's got a family together and I think he's been treated wrong.
It's a 19-year-old tsar, works hard and has been integrated in the team, has not had any kind of conflict with other players, it's very respected for the advertising, it's hardly trained, it's in a excellent form, it's a very balanced and mature tighter and I think it's deserved to be judged on the basis of its qualities and failures.
Healy also supported the decision not to calculate Kirgisi for the important remission mechanism, which begins Friday, and described “the common decision” as the most possible for all, but supported the return of the player originating from Canberra for a long term in the team.
"For the first thing, we want the team to keep it totally on the remise mechanism and not thinking anyway about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick went very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray, he maturized himself under public views and made some terrible mistake and deserved to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand his consequences and I think he needs a time when he is not in the centre of attention to reflect, good things for the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hilllary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders reduced half in national surveys
The State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, continues to gain two digits in the democratic course for national candidature, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the country.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic people (decreased from 58%), while Sanders is at two places, with 27% (at some point of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced if he candidates to the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic workers.
With at least five months before the beginning of primary elections, the majority of democratic electors say it's too early to say that they've decided the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidate supporters.
In the face of the CBS news last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won some percent.
Clinton keeps the advantage between women and moderates, but the benefit has been reduced.
The support between men has been significantly reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage in the democracy electors under 50 years has been evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in advantage of the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton is in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two digits, around the liberals, but Sanders now has a easily advantage of 5 points in this group.
A half of the democrats at national level stated that he would enthusiastically support Clinton if he had chosen to candidate on behalf of the party.
A sfert would have been backed and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps inevitably, the probability that Clinton's current supporters are enthusiastic about this choice is high.
The opinions are more mixed in those who do not support Clinton at present - only a sfert would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democrats state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican electors who declare the same about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are addressed a clear question about the reason why she would like to win the course, the majority response is that it holds adequate experience (16%), followed by the time that a woman is president (13%) and that it is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
These aspects and eligibility are also mentioned.
Since the President has taken into account a potential candidate at the presidency, 57% of the democratic people would like to see it in the course - even though a third of them think that it should not be candidated.
At the question of the second option for the representative of the party, the democratic people call Biden Major.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of the point that Biden would be the second option, much before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate in the Democracy Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows from 20 points with Biden to 30 points if it doesn't candid.
55% of the democratic people consider Clinton's candidate with the biggest chances to win the general elections; but the numbers have been low from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is remote at two places but the percentage that is the most appropriate has grown.
However, when you are wondering what is most important to a selected candidate, the democratic people prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered to be inacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential course.
Democrate candidates or possible candidates are well conducted with regard to some key characteristics towards the primary operators of their party.
The electors' responsibility considers Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrated and trusted and having strong qualities of leaders.
Biden is seen the best of all three about integrity, while Clinton's strong point is the leadership.
30% of the democratic people do not believe H. Clinton is integrated and trusted, twice more than those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have a view of him in this sense.
Democracy people also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideas as they.
Referring to all these aspects, almost a sfert of the democratic people have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions persisting about the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was State Secretary, most democratic electors are thanked for the explanation of this subject and say it has not affected their general appearance to the candidate.
But things are otherwise in the American public.
The half of the Americans are now disgraced by her explanation, while almost a third is thankful.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue had gone to youth.
The American authorities claim that this email-related controversy has not affected their general appearance of Clinton, although 36% claim that they have changed their appearance in a negative sense.
Most of the Republicans, more than six of 10 states that they have changed their appearance of Clinton in a negative sense.
Although the democratic people consider a integrated and trusted Clinton, this aspect continues to raise problems in the general electors: only 32% considers integral and trusted, with 8% less than last month and with 15% less than in May.
62% of the people do not consider it integral and trusted.
At the same time, 55% of national operators do not consider the integral and trustworthy Trump.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white white for leadership.
Of the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are classified by the first in respect of integrity.
The number of those who consider the integral Sanders is greater than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in the case of Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error margin for the testing of 351 of the primary democrats is 6 percent points.
Five members of the brothers who were accused of murdering the student in the year 1 of the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his lives during an initial Ritual of Pocon Mountains in Pennsylvania, five were accused of murder.
The members of Pi Delta Psi from the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a starting ritual in September 2013 and forced him to go to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to the statements of the police.
The official sources say that the victim was connected to the eyes, put him in the back a 14-kg rock full of sand and was broken repeatedly while trying to move to a target, on a green territory.
Mr. Deng accused the head pain after he lost her knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call the number of urgency after he was dismissed and claimed that he would have had a holiday before he was brought to the hospital, says the police.
But they found the time necessary to change Deng's clothes, look for the symptoms of Google and contact Andy Meng, the President of the Brothership at national level, to ask for advice, told the police boss, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"In this moment, the members began to hide personal goods and put the good practices of brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day of the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated hair traumases, strips and coaps.
"Too many were devastated by brothers' rituals, at least one student lost his lives every year because of rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer of Deng's family, in a statement.
Their brothers and members must be responsible, and this measure taken by authorities is important.
The Great Jue of the Monroe district recommended that the first five members be accused of crime for three degrees.
Other thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be accused of ultraj and complexity of crime.
"We want to take the response not only to the involved activities but, if there is a organization that has authorized the brother's, official or non-official, we will also take it to response," Wagner said on Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch's faculty prohibited the fraction and national fraction retraced its affiliation with local representative.
That's what's going to happen when the Federal Reserve will increase the profit rate
The rental rate will increase and the market boll (ground market) will be low, rentable obligations will grow and will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be and how long it's going to be.
In the economy, the history offers little indications on time-ranging..
After the first growth of the rent, the recession occurred in only 11 months and was 86 months.
The agressivity of the Federal Reserve to increase the rate of debt is often, although not always, a determining factor of how the reaction and financial assets are responding.
Therefore, the US central bank officers have so strongly accented the fact that investors should not be held at the time when it begins to increase the rate of debt, but the time trading necessary for normalization.
Actually, in the game there are multiple variables.
However, finally, market players could find that all the aggression related to the increase in the profit rate was exhausted.
“The first increase in the rate of Fed's debt after the world financial crisis will be interpreted inevitably by some votes as a sign of the Yephetian banks”, said Julian Jessop, Chief Economy in Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
In contrast, we don't expect the past return of the US profit rates to the more normal levels, but still small to constitute the sixish shock that seems to be afraid of all.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how several sectors of the economy could respond, based on historical trends:
Taking into account the ability that has been confronted in the last months, prevention of increased rate of profit can volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growing, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems to be a tendency that capital rentality is to stage between 12 and 24 months after the first growth, which reflects the defence of the monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analystes in a recent study on what will be done after the Fed crossings.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the pia has grown brushing - with approximately 14 per cent - directing to the increase of the profit rate, quite incapable in 250 days after (a average of 2.6 per cent) after returning to normal after 500 days, with a average return in the last 14.4 per cent cycles, according to a recent analysis published by Barron by the Boss Nuveen Asset Management Strategy.
Deutsche stated that the impact of actions has the tendency to become more pronounced in the rate increase cycle and the benefits begin to be lost.
Receiving is a reality of economic life, but increased profit rate often contributes to it.
In the face, Fed is opposed to anything that hadn't been before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the brute internal product will approach its minimum point the same to increase the rate of Fed profit.
According to Deutsche Bank, from the 118 increases in the debt rate since 1950, only two times the nominal PIB was less than 4.5%.
Even if the value was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, the third quarter reached only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The growth of the profit rate in such a fragil economy could be risked and could arise the question “if this time it is acquired”, said Deutsche.
The market players have prepared all the year for a growth decision from Fed, all the eyes are focused on the meeting of this week of the Federal Commission on the Deschise Market, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economicists believe that FOMC could increase the rate of debt at the time of this meeting, transactions at the time indicate the probability of only 25%.
"In our studies after 1950, all cycles of increase in the rate of profit currently found in a super cycle of increase in profits, the PIB puts the tops before the recession very quickly after recovery," reported the report.
In contrast, this was a strange recovery slowly after the most serious recession of the period analysed.
The current cycle is far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continued.
The fixed vengeance was also volatile as a result of an increase in the profit rate and the printer is somewhat similar to the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed is political.
In the case of obligations, the benefits seem to change the direction immediately as the first growth/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the growing cycle of the rental rate, the rentalability of the obligations expires immediately," Deutsche stated.
Charles Schwab thinks that these rental rate increases will determine the approach of rentality between short-term obligations and long-term obligations, adapting the curve.
High rental obligations are better in such a environment, although “we are still careful for the performance of rentality” stated in an analysis of Kathy Jones, analysed on fixed income in the Swab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets have already been adapted to the ends of the Fed policy.
"For the strength of the dollar and the decrease of the estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the perspective of a more rigid monetary policy," wrote Jones.
The short-term rental rate has grown, the rental curve is more right, the average credit gain rate has extended and volatility has increased - all the market characteristics when the Fed is aware of the policy.
In large lines, companies who perform their majority activity in the United States will be won by increased debt and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with big debtors will suffer because the growth of the dollar will lead to their products in the area of the global market and their debt will be closer.
"History shows that the "quality" stocks have tend to be more profitable in the three months after a initial increase in the rental rate," said the Goldman Sachs analysis in a report to customers.
The firms with powerful balances have overcome those with a weak balance after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate increases, with a average of 5 percent points.
Companys with large capital income and lower volatile stocks have also deployed similar companies with a lower quality, average of 4 (percentage points) or 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companys with a large percent of floating debt have the most lost, Goldman.
Consumers will also win from the increase of the dollar.
Those who economy may also win, although experts do not agree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conservative parliamentary Andrew Bingham criticized the radio position because he was "releasing"
This appears that it is of what more similar to the trade adversary
He also took the BBC Music Awards' eyes, showing that Brits' premiums were hurt.
College Damien Collins attacked The Voice, showing that neither this is original
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, declared a major parliamentary, pressing the job to prove that it does something that trade posts do not do.
Conservative parliamentary Andrew Bingham also transmitted to BBC boss that the public radio post "subscribes" and is more like the trade adversary.
"I am impressed that Radio 3 "subscribes" - even though I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards eye, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are the two examples that come in my mind that do not just to copy what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC denied the accusations, showing that BBC Radio 3 is greatly in front of his opponent in respect of living music and public education.
I'm not going to know anybody about the classic music I know from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to the radio 3 post to discover new music and allocation of new tracks," he said.
In the first part of this year, the BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that he needs to make more efforts to draw audience towards the previous period because the British people have less knowledge about classic music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element found under the BBC sign criticized in the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee because it would follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative Parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the show of talents bought by BBC from the Netherlands producer Talpa Media for a total of approximately 22 million litres of sterline.
Do you understand why there are often discussions relating to this view because it is not original and does not distinguish by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show performed by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in June - would be performed "in a specific way of BBC".
He added that he wanted that this Corporation “to ́s ́s golden eggs in his own ogras” the date on which he starts a show of entertainment.
However, he refused to prohibit the future receipt of new seasons from The Voice or to expend the money that goes on licences on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and the guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The latest growth of 2000 p.m. has been recorded in the last month.
Online sales took advance three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to purchase.
Specialists believe that the Black Friday in November could determine retirement at expenditure.
Over a decade, online purchases exploded and transformed trade streets from Britain into fantastic cities.
However, specialists say that there are signs that online sales are reduced, the last numbers increase only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total of the money expensed in August has shown the latest growth of 2000 p. Currently, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreased, the last numbers increase only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the growth level in the previous years and return to 2000, there was always a tendency to racionalize in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales took advantage three years ago, when the buyers started using the mobile phone to make buyers.
So he increased the number of those who could do online purchases and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the canapy.
But now that it is small, you can see a decrease (creasing).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for decreasing sales.
In the opinion of specialists, the purchasers would be able to make purchases before the event that occurs in the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers were weakened before computers to put the hand on offers, which led to the breaking of more detailed sites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when the buyers were baptized on the chilips, could determine the retice to the buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ of every 5 £ is spent online.
For certain products, such as television and sale machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than one sfert between it prefers to buy clothes and pantofis online than to join mode stores in commercial areas.
After the Sanction of the Bin Laden family, the Muslims buried the victims killed after the destruction of the macara in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets of Muslims, the first funerals in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia shared the giant in Saudi Binladin Group buildings for destruction.
The Ministry of Health stated that in total 394 of them were wounded after the destruction of the macar
In the street travel ceremonie, hundreds of muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a moschee moschee sea in Mecca.
You dressed in white, those who cryed about the dead went on the road to express their condolences when the first dead arrived to the end of the final trip, at the Al-Moaissem citizen.
Three memory kept from the sanctuary place, where only a few days a building makro was broken through the Moschea's board, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funerals after King of Saudi Arabia sanctionsed the Bin Laden family building group for disaster, which also soldied with 394 wounds.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a moschee moschee in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of the four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first peerinage when the macarau was cut off.
Mr. Akram is in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the beginning of the annual haey pillary.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the haey pillary to Mecca will continue, thousands of peerries continue to reach the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin group shouldn't have left the brass of the macar when the car wasn't working.
A Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group is partly guilty of destruction.
The English service of the news agency did not provide that detail, but it said that the leaders of the company had been prohibited.
Earlier during this week, Salman swore to disclose what caused the macar in the court of Maria Moschea, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Haj peerry that has happened later this month.
The Binladin group has not yet made statements on the destruction of the macar and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree assured the group that he did not use updated measures and did not coordinate its activity with the orological authorities.
Ten mackers around the Moschee Sea in Mecca, as part of the massive building effort led by the Binladin Group.
Since a few decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the king's family of Saudi Arabia and has drafted large construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "rejected" son, deceived by the family in the 1990s.
Building has occurred in powerful wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of a million people in the kingdom to participate in peerinage, essential trip at least once in life.
The authorities declare that 158 in hospital are.
The authorities decided that the wheels of victims who were dead to receive a million Saudites Riali (174.000 pounds of sterline) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent wounds.
Other wounds will receive half of this sum.
Advantages and deficiencies of the conversion of credits into Switzerland francs
On the market, the bank has already appeared two conversion offers in the law of the Swiss credits to the Swiss francs, the main advantages are the exclusion of the assessment risk and the reduction of rates.
Deficiencies can come over a few years, when the variable results can lead to increasement of rates.
Bank Transilvania has completed the process of conversion of credits in francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost has announced a conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the data collected by the FinZoom Financial Portal analysis, Bancpost offered three years of stakeholder, 1.5%, the smallest of the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transilvania Bank was accepted by 83% of franco credit customers due to the second successful reduction: the cost was reduced with the value of the risk commissions and the customer's payable administration, and then an additional decrease of 22.5% was applied to the loan in law.
Both offers decrease the rate of their customers, the girl who pays a month equivalently before the conversion.
Thus, Bank Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bankpost, 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of coverage in the CHF credit law is to eliminate the balanced risk, the consumer is protected by the frank's live cresters, and the refund of the credit will be made in the currency in which the salaries are involved.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no re-evaluation of property is made, no additional guarantees or other evidence of income.
In practice, a new financial and legal analysis of the credit will not be made and will not be additional costs as in the case of a refinancer.
Both of them also offered a reduction at the monthly rate, the girl who payed the customers before the conversion, equivalent to it.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formatted more in the doband, and the client returns very little from the main.
Bancpost offer with a very little delight in the first three years seems to be advantageful for customers.
You don't know how this will take place three years ago.
The margin offered to customers may be more than 3.25%, so totally, and the reduction of costs is less.
A possibility of risk for all the credits in the law with the variable debt, is that the ROBOR index grow significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days since 2008, 40%!
Moreover, it is possible to provide other costs not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time of decisions on the rate of debt for the Federal Reserve of the United States
The world takes attention to its planned meeting within two days, Wednesday and Friday, when the United States Federal Reserve will take a crucial decision whether to grow or not the rate of debts for the first time after nearly a decade.
A survey carried out by Re日s with 80 economys, less than half that believed that the decision would be taken last week, now I think that the debt will be kept for a while and that the debt rates will be kept in the current interval of 0-0.25%.
It's an event because they've spent seven years since the Federal Reserve has brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are confronted with a position where a major central could revoke the rate of zero and start a process of normalization of profit rates," Angel Ubide, analyzed the leader of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The United States economy has developed relatively well, recycling brings billion dollars into balance and generates a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global condition less rose.
He warned the markets to prepare for a growth, but there are signs that they think that such movement is a little likely.
The decision will be an announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.

Luke Shaw player from Manchester United is on bar for a few months due to double fractions.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the Manchester United game in the Campions Liga, finished with a break in front of PSV Eindhoven.
According to the event that brought his tears in the sight of the player and who will keep it on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal'ne optimist that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The performance was followed by an unseen intervention by Hector Moreno at 15 minutes, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke PSV.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was gone to hospital.
Van Gaal stated: "There is a double fracture at the feet and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a kid who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, faced difficulties, then played fantastic and now happens something like that.
His oxygen mask was placed in the newspaper.
The plague.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture, the rest is six months and it won't play at the stage of groups.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seems to have been lucky and saved from the red carton and the concession of a chastisement shot.
Arbitr Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge alone when I say it's wrong and red carton.
It was a very worst intervention with two.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, I start the way to recover, I'll be stronger."
Similar knowledge: Manchester United wounded by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV
The Fund of England's team has a further reason to recover to play at the European Campionship in Fran's next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV entrepreneur, said, "It's a very hateful accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such a accident.
Our players never follow the accident of an opponent.
Moreno cut off his leg playing for Mexico's nation against the Netherlands Nation, led by Van Gaal to the World Campionship of 2014.
"He's very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see only the coat, which moved into another direction, so he thought [Moreno] had touched it but I couldn't see Luke's intervention.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how difficult it is to pass through such a thing.
I feel so stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Watchdo, also arrived to the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's disappointment, but it still keeps strong
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I have seen the team selected by England for tournament, I don't calculate a repeat of breaking with 3-0 in tests.
I wouldn't remove any variance of a victory in moving.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin line and the collective moral is powerful; they will not be marked by 2012's discussions but will have a youth positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolutes as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is us at the test level, represents an attack option.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth was a team of England for test mechanisms and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his main trainer in Yorkshire, I'm difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test mechanisms against two good attackers, in difficulties, and the reality simply but hard is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, when the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own electors.
For fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destination is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire, he'll have some other opportunities.
The main entrenor of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised her attitude even when Performan wasn't at its level and doesn't surprise me; first, it's a team man.
It is hard to answer the question how long a batsman is noted in the tests.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had lucky home and moved.
The only injury you could have was that England prefered Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that rated opportunity is the area of the past.
In the team, Alex Hales, a batsman I'm cooking very well.
It's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and we've previously noted in Yorkshire at this season when he marked 236 against us at a Trent Bri's pit.
It should be granted at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the composer of the UAE team.
It was launched the idea that Moeen's getting to the bathroom with Cook, which would bring extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I don't have anything contrary.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hit there, and this left player has already shown that it's given to the fuck.
Maybe Moeen did not have success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for those, so the difference is not big.
My old team colleague, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test mechanisms 38 as the first drop before he entered open in 2001.
He just spent three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the team on the back-up spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, he hit me the fact that it's a very impressionant t.
Humans could judge his fraged age - with a average of 31 to the battle and 35 to the minge - and may think that it is a point, but there is not a lot of spinners, and the choices have chosen for youth.
He'll learn many of this tour.
England brought a few ambitions to the train team.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka batsman, depending on a consultor for test mechanisms could be a master's wound.
It's one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it has played in any way and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball link of the tour and will bring both energy and irreversible ambition.
I've always thought he was born to be involved in the international cricket, either as player or as a trainer, and as Mahela, he's intuition.
Sometimes, new voices from the newspaper, even if you send messages that have been transmitted and previously, you can bring hot air into the team.
Colly Durham's companion, Ben Stokes rests for the meals one day, Root has received a similar pause against this and I don't have any problem with this.
Although they're not all agreed, trainers and electors do not do the program.
And you need to keep, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions will never be easily taken.
The Brexit camp could have a cause of winning if it holds it calm in 2017
On the day, the renegociation strategy of David Cameron to maintain the Great Britain in the EU is still stronger, even without the choice of Jeremy 'Yes' or 'no' genius? Corbyn brings serious criticism to Europe.
Foreigners have their characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last days that - down in similar crisiss with the EU - not all being caused inside - some Member States are feeded by the British Concessions and Treaties agenda, which most of them do not want.
At Brighton, at the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they wouldn't want this if they would erode social protection.
We could even call Dave and George's self-agenda.
Prime Minister and canceller participate in summary or bilateral sessions of foreign capitals, make a position in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then returning home and declare that they have won for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with a perspective outside under the EU coverage - "Don't leave us alone with Fran," says Berlin - suggests that many more ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they go or go.
Angela Merkel, an extremely cautious German canceller, is an aliat, but he has been in carrying for 10 years and wants to take the position before it claims, like that with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, President of France, François Holland, will be real or replaced.
And his power is declined.
Poland might have soon a right nationalist, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help English whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from getting out of the United Kingdom - something they do not want because most have similar separatist trends.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make an intentional observation that does not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the Reference campaign in the Great Britain of 2017 to deal with Brexit process, suggests my friend.
"The renegociation was fixed" and "The Great Britain has no value from renegociation."
The Europeans know in their skin how much apartment can be Fleet Street and how skeptic the oligarch press baronies looking at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the referendum of 1975 inspired by Tony Benn, which has made our entrance in 1973 in the report 2:
Perhaps I remember Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became celebrated at the beginning of 90 C.E. when he was appropriate in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They included the mix of tax nonpayers, foreigners who broke phone and pseudo non-domes who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was looking at the same but she realized that when you're in a cow close to a nervous gorilla, you need to give the bananas to take care of the thought to eat you at dinner and the tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in a position towards Cameron's reference idea, taking into account that Blair made a consent on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by the French and Dutch representatives in 2005, who offered him an exit carton.
The press didn't forgive him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me friendly at Westminster after months - I told him not to consume his time with me anymore - it seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's booking strategy in the 80s, a mistake when and now.
It may be hard, but it must develop a coherent media cooperation strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position in BBC left her summer vacation.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call indulgently evolution.
This states that we would like to join in a reformed EU.
The responsibility of those who do not agree with the "anglicism" of conservators could be agreed with this.
This said Hilary “Un Benn, but not a Bennite” Benn at the radio and TV this week, when his researcher struck to not recognize that the name of John McDon by Corbyn as a minister of the shadow was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s when his father struck on TV to be unloyal to labour colleagues, without going too far and losing his function in the cabinet.
Hillary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight for "in any way" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDon said and not to what JC said to colleagues and parliamentaries during the private meeting of Monday night.
About the picture that Corbyn wants to send - you're holding, he's also identified me - the discipline of important messages in the TV era, and especially at the top of social networks, a focal of paranoia and trading.
It is right to not give Cameron a favorable ticket in Europe, allowing them to be well supported in the referendum campaign, as McDon said.
Simon Jenkins thinks of this.
However, McDon and Corbyin's basic sophism on the quality of EU members - in accordance with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer a ezoteric discussion in the left distants for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
Like in the case of his sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is unclean about the fact that JC will not do campaign for renewal - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand.
Why should Paris or the Berlin political capital - and there are suspicious suspicioners - for concessions against the Great Britain when everything could be inutile?
The United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military performan of English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservator who takes the costs, as I remembered the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Critical specialists decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the performances of an agency whose electronic cigarettes are less damaged than smoke resulted in a meeting between 12%, some of them with the tube industry.
Specialists in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet publication in criticing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complete analysis of evidence".
Some researchers, however, doubted the strength of the data and dressed the finger to the ships between certain experts and the tube industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked the "extraordinary fragil base" which the PHE founded its main conclusion.
Other two researchers who write in BMJ signed the question and the foundation of them "on solid earth or on moving sand".
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London High School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, clinical epidemiology teacher at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policy must be based on effectiveness."
They concluded that the PHE's estimates under which “the current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are less damage than smoke” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting in which 12 people participated led to the elaboration of a model of decision analysis with multiple criteria (MCDA) that synthetises their appearances regarding the negative effects associated with nicotine products; the results of this meeting have been shortly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a Euroswiss Health company, about whom the Executive Director said that it had been received financially from British American Tobacco in the past for an independent study.
It also validated the BAT aid in public health in a sustainability report.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the finance received by a electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the financial report that it would have received from the cigarette and tube production company Philip Morris International.
No arguments have been provided on the basis of which the panel members have been selected, but among them are some of the "fruits" known in the electronic cigarette production, some of those even declared in the financial work of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in the control of the tunnel.
At the meeting, he also participated in the head of the Tunnel Control Section in the PHE.
The research work made by the group "mussamalizing in convinced way" is the fact that the "fast evidence of the damage effect that most products have in accordance with the majority of the criteria", McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these restrictions or restrictions.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE's initiatives "no evidence at present that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking between children or unfounders" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the PHE Health Department, states that he has been responsible in the past to BMJ.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less damage than smoke."
One of the two who have smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this vineyard.
All evidence suggests that the risk of electronic health cigarettes is comparable, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
The PHE has clear obligation to inform the public about the information that has been made and which does not have evidence, particularly taking into account the high degree of public confusion on the relative risks compared to the tube.
Yearly, approximately 80,000 people lose their lives because of a bull associated with smoke and the annual costs supported by the national health system due to smoke are reached to 2 billion pounds.
Explaining clearly the current evidence - and, in fact, that, although use of your electronics is not missing risks, it is only a fraction of the damage of smoke - we fulfil our national duty.

Reviews that disappoint the trade with weapons of the British Marine
Follow the film performed by Amnesty International against the weapons cargo.
Drone killed terriblely!

And electrical bastards that provoke painless without leaveing the following!
The joyful voice and the animated images do not allow doubts that this claim for the largest world weapons loop is a open series of opens, made by Amnesty International to underline the desire to the British authorities to sell the weapons of representative regimes through Defence and Security International Equipment to ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to showing a large number of posters in bus stations and in metros that need one second view.
"It's important, traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turns into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of weapons dealers will be left › DLR clients are requested to contribute to the stop of weapons.
The 300 posts are made by artists who exposed the works at the Museum Designs, Dismaland, Banksy.

One of the parodia announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Designs and Conference at the University of Essex, artists put up more questions and seeking to do political works of the public outside the galeries.
Many artists are directed to the collaboration with actors in protest movements, realizing that they have to go into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against the weapons trade that occurs to the metroway vessels.
The film made by Amnesty had more than 1000,000 visualizations on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP public agency who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
The VCCP creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by silence around the campaign - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let us offer the campaign that he is trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistical advice, but “with powerful animations and colours, it was more exciting”.
"I've done a job by helping us to increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the market," said Tom Davies in the name of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary that British authorities take measures and ensure that torture equipment are not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the weapons cargo comes from the interior of ExCeL, where exposures offer fantastic eufemistic products.
A press communicate, Saab exposed a dictionary received from the United States Army on "AT4CS RS with a lance-in-launcher on the shoulder".
This includes “a single focus that offers oil effects behind the weapons, within the target.
Anything that would mean, it wouldn't be.
Eight gold rules to live on the road
They have spent 11 years since I moved to the road, when I was a 19-year-old twelve, who still believed in beverages and moral relations, but now I just remember my dreams for those I've envyed -- and the number of mourning at the address of others.

Violent David Grimal: At Bach’s time, there were no global tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French Violist David Grimal is one of the large artists of our days, not just as solist but as the initiator of a less usual project, to the right "shed", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra format of international solists and talented musicians, which interpreted a symphonic repository without a leader, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classic music field.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two spectacles: a representation, Sunday, where the solest was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when the Xavier Phillips violoncelist was first found, the works composed of Enescu being nelipsed.
Both spectaculars, discovered on the Athens scene, showed the public another way to interpret classic music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as the only classic music assembly in which there was no leader.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true that musicians need education, or to become solists, or to be interpreted in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentists, and not of composers.
They're formatted as "specialised composers".
But they have the impression that they need a leader.
On the other hand of the scene, for the public, all the musical fatization is worth the leader.
And so, business, music industry, they make marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers, what's stupid, and a public that can't do it, but we need to watch, what's stupid," David Grimal considers.
The violist reports that this change in the way music makes come after "music deceptions" from his solistic career.
I was like a high-level athlete that had to do the same exercise worldwide with orchestras to punish a lot of money and to offer money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30, I found this very depressive, because I didn't find human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create the Dissonances.
This happens in 2004, and at that time no one did that without a leader: "The Music World, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you make marketing with a music collective where there is no ego anymore?" asked the artist.
David Grimal recognized that Les Disonaces represents "a lux", expressing that no one of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the assembly, the box of a leader did not prove to be a piece in the musical act: "In a curious way, how we can sing a more complex record, so simply, because all musicians are obliged to be present in operation and not only in role," Grimal supports, while as on Sunday spectacle "I was 74 times on the scene".
In the opinion of Grimal, the Enescu Festival is a "courageous gate", just because he invited Les Dissonances: "A extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchesters in the world are present and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchesters you have invited this strange group."
In a temple of the orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something that spreads barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's operation, the violonist recognized as the Roman music of the Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu works in the repository or.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinct, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made the French music."
Grimal military for the change in the way classic music education is made, considering "the media of music, as it is organized today, has a dead spring" and "the future of music represents insect music".
We don't have to do the five-year-old round if you don't serve anything.
At Bach's time, there were no global tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organising concerts, festivals, tours, launching albums, all are amazing, extraordinary, but as long as they are doing in music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativeness suffers, it's no longer freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave examples to Romans before and posted access to the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter the EU, you have fruit and good meat."
In order to enter the EU, health laws which were not good for trees and meat were to be adopted.
Production and agriculture come to the supermarkets, as is in France.
The music happens the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances make the roses may not be too beautiful, but when they're tired, they're the real roses.
In a ideal world, this music should return to the center and that institutions and industry that manages this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be presented, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I consider - as the Koreans, Chineses, Japanese - that western music is one of the most beautiful things of the humanity, we bring her learning back to school, we restore the concerts to television, and through this education we wouldn't need to sell musical subproducts," Gremal believes.
With the same thing, there are things in classic music education that are very communist raman, that's over all, it's something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to a instrument, being, first, musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.d.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's something else.
After your appearance, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asked the French artist zambind.
Grimal seems to be, for artists, a different way of doing music comes from the oversight of this "soldate" status, the oversight of what "is thinking they are their limits": "Music discover in a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after concert, they go out of the congress."
David Grimal talked about the project or music and about his vision of music and artist in the "Idea Festival", a discussion with the public organized in the International George Enescu Festival of the Institute Aspen Romania.

Cinema City is looking for "Small Voices Mari"
The City cinema starts the biggest challenge for children: the duplication of two persons in the superproduction "Craiasa Snow 3D"
You have a super-talent and spontaneous child who loves the movies?
Give her the chance to get a look.
In September, in the newest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitional children, wishing to reach live stars and between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City looks for "Micile Voci Mari", offering them a extraordinary opportunity to double two persons in a famous animation film.
If in classic drawings the accent was placed on the approach of the actor's voice of the specific animated person during the last period, the creation of the story was taken into account and those who were to interpret the voices, and they are usually very known actors.
The City City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices, and therefore we start an inexpeditive campaign.
We want to find the voice that can grow and cause parents to write their children to our concurrence.
They will have part of a special experience, because characters are kind and replics are funny.
"The kids will enter and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said John Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
At the first stage of concurrence, on September 11 - 30 September, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection in which 10 children will be selected (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording study with professionals.
All you need to do by parents is to hold the smallevocemari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to record the child at the concurrence and prepare it for the test of voice.
Later, you have to choose one of the four platform films, download the texts that the child will read and then, the child will be registered by interpreting his own double version.
Four films about friendship, basm, magic, and experience can choose competitors for the support of tests: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: The Guardian of Monday 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the known 3D" and "Albinu · Maya 3D".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream filled and double a person from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - The Cross of the 3D Snaps", which will have the first in Romania in November this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, I lose tax previsions for 2016
FedEx declared dezamag results for the last trimester, the library gigant, reducing the profit estimates for the whole year as a result of the lower request for transport services and increased costs for its territory transport division.
The company also stated that it intended to engage about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period of the past year, FedEx announced that he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's actions decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the clopoc closure sound.
FedEx Corp. stated that it was difficult to win between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year that ends the month of the next year, with less than 20 cents, according to a previous estimation.
Analysers preconceived $10,84, according to an investigation conducted by FactSet.
The decreased estimation is although price increases by 4.9% in average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overtaxels for the large or large-weight transport of packages, which will apply in November.
The company stated that it was still increasing winning for the previous year as a result of the reduction of costs, greater income and the development of online trade.
The President and Director-General Fred ́t said that “the company is confronted with a significant economic situation weaker than it is preconceived, in particular as regards the production and global trade”.
Employment plans for the holiday were announced on one day after the UPS competitor said that he intended to engage 90,000-95.000 additional workers, particularly the same number of commitments that he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the year.
The profits per action were $2,42, under average estimation of $2,44 per action made by 12 analyzers who responded to Zacks Investment Research investigation.
The profit increased by 5%, for 12,3 billion dollars.
Six analysts who participated in the investigation carried out by Zacks estimated the amount of $12,23 billion.
FedEx has been killed in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which led to the stagnation of incomes registered by its Express unit.
However, the explosion in online purchases resulted in the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the land division increased by 29%, but the operational income was practically stagnated due to greater costs for large packages and their own insurance.
The express unit registered an increase in income due to greater basic tariffs, while the income registered by the freight division has been decreased due to growing costs.
At the pre-market transaction, with almost a hour before the discovery sound, the FedEx actions are low with $3,85 or $2,5%, at $ 150.15.
Wednesday to be low by 11% at year and 17% towards the maximum record record recorded on 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in the past years, the political development of the Federal Reserve will last two days this week around a 27-year honduran mahon board to decide whether the time has come to increase a key rate of profit for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the end of the central bank's meetings Hall, a wall painting of the United States will be held.
Carta is mentioned to remember that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation more than any.
The Central Bank received a double task from the Congress: maximising the rate of employment in the United States and maintaining price stability.
However, since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is one of the third unwritten tasks: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a too difficult anticipated decision, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the United States is prepared to be deal with the stimulant without a short-term debt rate for nearly 0 in force from the end of 2008.
Although most of the data indicate a powerful economy, recent happiness on the global financial markets could already expect the Fed officers to add volatility by increaseing the reference rate to the federal funds - even with a percentage point.
"Obviously, job and inflation will be the first and main aspects that will be followed," Lindsey Mr. Piegza, the leader of the brokering company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if those would ask for a excuse to not increase the rate of debt, the uncertainty in the world market is sufficient to offer them arguments to wait more," it said.
There is no consciousness about the decision that Fed will take, providing itself instabilised on the financial market.
About half of the economys recently questioned by Bloomberg have started an increase in the rate of profit this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to reduce Fed, a key indicator indicating that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease on the board if Fed increases the rate of debt, except where those who develop the policy would reduce the struggle promised that it would take long time to the next increase.
Wednesday, the industrial media Dow Jones reached 228,89 points, or 1.4%, p. 16.599,85.
The advance was determined by the arguments that Fed's decision factors will keep the rate of the stability rate this week, declared John Lonski, the Economy Boss of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that Fed would grow the rate of profits at this time," Lonski said.
If Fed's decision factors would do this, "they should act in profusion in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets."
Other experts declared that an increase in the profit rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty related to the time when Fed will act.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be the way to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slowness of the money that would confirm for the US recovery.
Yellen declared first and at the beginning of the year that it was expected to increase the rate of this year, despite the raising of liberal objects such as the need for more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs stopped in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.
The score rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and nearly the level considered by Fed as a total employment.
Payment wins have shown signs of growth.
And although the inflation continued not to reach the annual objective of the central bank, the Fed decision factors have concluded that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices that were decreased.
The economy “perhaps face greater rate and needs them, being the pression of the job market”, said Ian Shepherdson, the leader of the Economy at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to enter into fibrilations at the end of this month, after China devaluated its currency.
The industrial medium Dow Jones decreased by 16% under the maximum record reached in May, since investors feared that the Chinese economy stops the world growth.
Pia repeated sometimes this month, Dow indexs are now with approximately 10% under the maximum of May.
For Fed's decision factors, market accumulation is addressed to the complex calculation of the time of increase in the profit rate.
"For what has been held on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," Stephen D. Ole, experienced researcher under UCLA Ziman Center for Real State and was official Fed.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is very much uncertainty that will be the impact of the US economy and almost that they have no data to be based on later events in China," said Ol.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so practice should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But actually, Fed became the monetary authority worldwide.
In recent years, the central bank was big.
A simple allusion of the President since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "build" his monetary extent has declined on the markets at the world level.
There is a world where markets and economys are combined from more, it is expected that Fed officers not only monitor the progress recorded in other areas but also consult other central banks and experts to interpret better worldwide.
His decision-making process is “more artist than science”, Zachary Karabell, the leader of the Global Strategy Department of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., stated this month that “Fed has an extent of reaction to the changes in the financial market that seem to have not been involved in economic bases”.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission for the Pia Disclosed, offered a decision-making body, which supported the increase in the rental rate, as an example of the decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis affecting Asia decided Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% to three meetings, “in spite of the implications with limited identification for the United States Dez”, Lacker stated.
A year later, the officers of Fed returned to these degrees.
Fed should put the financial stability problem first only in the case of a major crisis, such as market deterioration in 2008, stated Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England debt rate committee.
The last aggressed period does not rise far away to that level, he said.
"Although we don't want to reach the fear of an increase in the rate of debt because the markets have been deteriorated," Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, when something is changed in this regard, I don't think it should take preliminary measures.

4_BAR_ They lost their lives after the police dropped with cowboys in the protestants in Nepal
Four faces, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal after the police dropped with cocktails in the multitude that demonstrated against the new constitutions of the country, a officer declared Wednesday.
Violences occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, at approximately 280 km west of Kathmandu capital.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal's statements, the Departmental Police Boss, over 1,000 protestants were gathered before a police section, and some of them were thrown with stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police forces used the lacrimogen gas after which they dropped fires in the air before he recovered to the use of the cow-shirts.
According to this statement, twenty police officers and five civilians were hurt.
It wasn't clear why the bullets, about which they know that they can kill but are usually used as less late alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The shocking was the last event after weeks of violent protests resulted in the south region of Nepal, where the members of the ethnic group of Maddesi show that the new provinces ended on the basis of the new Constitution would have a political influence.
Protests also existed in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants his own state.
At least 40 of them, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent shoes deceived on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement on the share of the country in the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a extremely controversy problem in Nepal, which was centrally centered for hundreds of years.
The process of preparing a new constitution was started in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating destruction that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the clauses of the constitutional draft and the officers declared that the new card could be adopted on Sunday.

Weight reduction surgery may be useful for diabetes with easily obesity
The benefits of the weight reduction surgery in the case of easily obesity, with type 2 diabetes can be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too to say if diabetes with easily obesity live more after surgical intervention of weight loss than those following nechirurgical treatment.
"There is a long time to centralize the mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, specialist in obesity surgery, because she wrote a article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, named and bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hungry and limit the property of the body to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been demonstrated in the treatment of diabetes type 2, but most studies have been disrupted with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or above.
IMC, a weight measure unit compared to the height, is considered normal within 18.5-24.9.
The INC value of at least 25 indicates that a INC is superior and the IMC's values exceeding 30 are considered ob.
You can calculate the IMC by: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Spital in Taiwan used strict data after 2007 in a trial where two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomy in manchon - in the medical treatment of sugar diabetes type 2 with easily obesity.
The average IMC to the surgical intervention has been reduced from 31 to 24.5 p.m. at the end of the fiveth year in the study.
In time, the IMC at the intervals that received nonchirurgical treatment against diabetes remained almost at the same level, including 29.
Among those who suffered chirurgical intervention, the sugar diabetes was completely healed at 36% and partly by 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, the sugar diabetes was completely healed at only 1% and partly only 2% of the subjects.
Furthermore, the control of the blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL "Rue colesterol" were generally "better in the chirurgical group", concluded the authors.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects the level of glycaemia at time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c hemoglobin is under 7%.
After surgical intervention, the average level of A1c hemoglobin was decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, there was approximately 8%.
However, this combined glucemic control - reflected by the combined levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce the rate of mortality to five years, according to the researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and the colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of chirurgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrointestinal gastrointestinal group, the bypass chirurgical group lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases of the IMC value (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of total sugar diabetes remission (46.9% to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or survival after five years, there are evidence in a high-weight study in Sweden that the surgery intervention extends lives, by Blackstone, from the University of Arına, the Medical Faculty - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, ob°s who have suffered barriatric surgery have shown a likelihood of about 29% less to die after 15 years, compared to a group who has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who had suffered a surgery intervention, Blackstone said that it was an optimistic aspect of INC-subsequents under 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point in which this work is critical, since it seems that this chirurgical intervention is safe in the group with the lower IMC” without increased risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient's IMC reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too much for people to take this serious aspect," she said.
I think when they accumulated these genetic disorders that shortened the body by predicting them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to return to normal.
“It is impossible that everyone come to Europe” - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all reactions, stated Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution for the current recycling crisis is located in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Tibetan leader sent a call to end the violence of the mother's reaction countries.
Dalai Lama talked about the current crisis of reactions in the speech that he held at the discovery of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compaison in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies at the beginning of his 10-day visit in the United Kingdom.
He said that in the present time, the interests of humanity should be overwhelmed in front of the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, despite admirable, the response to the reaction crisis of western Europe countries is inadequate.
"It is impossible that everyone come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to face the crisis, he stressed the fact that it was just a temporary solution.
"It's a wonderful care for a few thousand reactions, but we must think at the same time on long-term solutions to make peace and deceit, especially through education, in the Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the foundation, we need to think about how to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
For never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the violence problem, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after terrorist attacks on September 11, showing that the US violent response generated an incontrolable band of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent condolences in a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without calling on violence.
I know that his reasons were powerful but he used for and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.

According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Centre for Opening in Georgia, the cases of hand detergent in children under 12 years reported to the anti-opening centres came from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
“The children have more frequently in these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of these are reaching the emergency room,” said Lopez for CNN.
Lopez said that some children were intended to drink detergently and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be tracked with films that represent adolescents how they drink detergent to create grass beverages.
Youths seem to have mixed the detergente with alcool water to get a stronger bath.
Small children can be attracted by the detergent's attractive mirror.
"A kid doesn't think he does bad," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (detergent from hands) are the perfumes.
Hand detergents with aroma of caps, wheat, portfolio are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
In particular in small children, only a few hazards can cause alcohol disorder.
"This is very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-opening centre in the University Spital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel from Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a whiskey pair on the table, but people leave those hand detergents in places, and if the little ones come to them, this is a quick way to consume much alcohol.
Nhaiyah, a six-year-old girl who recently entered the school equivalent of four pulverizations with detergent hands with aroma of heads, came to the emergency room to get treatment.
He had alcohol 179, twice greater than the prize to which a adult is considered under the alcohol influenza law, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room that treated her at the Medical Gwinnett Centre outside Atlanta.
Nhaiyah was stuck and couldn't die when he came to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain disappointment because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, said Ritchey.
"It was angry," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaiyah's mother, for CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use honey products or services without alcohol and not to leave the hand detergent at the hand of children.
In the lake with alcohol, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after deterrented hands containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained meta, a late substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as a active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the north of New York concluded to stop their "roo" teacher by putting anti-bacteria in class", according to a police report.
Professor's very allergic at hand detergent and has prohibited him in his course room.
The police considered that the plan was "insignificant" and addressed the disciplinary problem of the school inspector.

Griffiths disconnects the sounds related to unintelligences
There were sounds related to uncertainties in Celtic, demonted by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team would not be subject to a growing pressure because they were prepared to face the leaders of the Netherlands law.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are almost crazy.
Absen_ Scotland in the course of title____________________________________________________________________________________
The middle of those from Rangers and the former international player Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that the Netherlands supporters had lost their interest in Celtic - because they did not fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently the ambassador of the Ajax ambassador, said: "In Netherlands no longer sends the summary of those from Celtic; why?"
Because they're not those from Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
It's about the Old Company.
It's about both laol teams, and there's interest.
The pressure is big in the Old Company meals and not only the Scotchians want to see these mechanisms.
I'll change the story, Promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was fighting for repurchases, but the Norwegian boss promised to change it.
Infraction with Malmo and later elimination from the Campions Liga was followed by the infringement in front of Aberdeen that played in 10 people, now in the whole classing with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtics have had a period before and they will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and many people are extremely furious or sadly linked to what's going on.
Likewise, we - but we need to go further.
We've never thought we needed the extent of those from Celtic because so players become better.
It's extremely important to make units now.
Warburton's Pruden's transfers in January
Despite the last comments for just a few weeks that suggested that some objectives for the transfers of January would have been identified, the leader of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team unit.
The boss of Brentford stated: “The period of transfers from January is very different from the war.”
In the case of players transferred to the sea, there is a period before the season you could be integrated, what you could observe in this season in our group.
The team works very well.
Sometimes you do more bad if you bring players that are not necessary.
Celtic sees Michu after retraction
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that it could be retracted to the expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struck two years with the gastrointestinal problems and couldn't get out of Galilore country in the village.
Hearts face SFA relating to Neilson's comments
Hearts were driven with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red cartridge cancelled in eight months.
Neilson keeps his statements, insisting: "I have not doubted integrity, I have not commented on perfection."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tynecastle
The Invisible Hibee was taken on the road after he repeated that he sang a song with official verses about the former player of Hearts, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 in a pub of Roseburn region in Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"He was derby and was the enthusiasm of the time," the striker said, "It is no longer necessary to say I'm not going back to Tynecasts but playing for Celtic."

The rate of shooting in Scotland unshaped while growing in the Great Britain
THE ROY of SOMAY in Scotland, which was 164.000 in July, while the number of britains totally increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.

The Swiss State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the last numbers, said: "The long-term authorities' plan was based on a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland has taken historical decision to participate in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, I observed the employment rate of jobs in Scotland, recording the rate of employment, and the rate of decreasing rate.
Why I'm witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In this day, except a later legal intervention, I will see how a man is condemned to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a ship for observers in the Implementation Room of the State of Oklahoma and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by the administration of the police injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and even though I was shot, I accepted.
As the day comes for the reason, I'm scared of the idea.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell all the story of capital punishment.
He'd offer a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can be witnesses in execution in America, and because the requests usually exceed the number of places, there is a macabra lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay along with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also deceived my own time with him during the months of telephone conversations and a visit that spent two hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The penitentiary authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a bottle and a pix with me to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all my details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of committing my impartiality.
Here's the lection.
He tells the story of the detaine as he wants, gets.
I've cryed about her.
He repeatedly said that “they could better formulate, ” but it is still thinking that they were wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I told and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it either if she asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses ever.
But he wants to present a international report to write about the subject.
He thinks, if he dies, publicity will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, you have a series of multimedia files that I have done.
I'm not going back here, all the details.
I can't sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complication.
But I think it's pretty like he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there haven't been enough evidence to justifie the death punishment.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll see him died from this perspective.
I can't say I'm totally targeted.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out how it's to look at a man who likes to die inutile.
Peter Moody suggests that the stewards tried to spion him and threatened to get back from the courses.
Peter Moody believed that Racing Victoria stewars or tried to infiltrate a spy on his stairs last year and threatened that he was straight away from the courses.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the Department of Integrity of Racing Victoria, showing that they deal with a personal campaign against it, the pickage that filled the wheat being the elimination of Lady Daddy from the course because of a treatment administrated on the course day.
Moody stated for Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the courses and that it was placed in a difficulty when it comes to the positive result of the leader's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
In 18 months, he was broken up his words about spion declarations and did not want to seem to "the wall that doesn't come to the wheat".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I was quiet for a long time but sometimes you reached a level of frustration so high that everything was coming once," said Moody.
He knows he's continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to submit the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quiet.
I'm going up with my head and I want the owners with whom I'm working to see that you're trying to offer them everything better.
Since they start thinking that it doesn't happen, I have to cancel the trainer.
At that point I'll have to think what I'm gonna do with my certificate.
Previously, Moody washed the bomb in an interview given for racing.com in which he declared that the Department of Integrity tried to spy the grains.
"Later eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart stood in a ship with a man - whose name I will tell him if I was asked - and they offered him to engage in my grades to provide information about the activities there," said Moody for Racing.com.
Obviously, he's thinking about me as a triumph.
If so, then you should all be dismissed because they were incompatible in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, President of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current Executive Director of the RVL, knew at that time and I know and today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary that RVL begins to have a vertebral column and can lead to the response outside the trainers for what is going on in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is it so stupid to my industry?
Maybe so I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and give me somewhere and I don't doubt that the statements that I do now may decide to think about this variant.
But I came to the point where I don't care anymore, and that tried me.
I'm very sad.
I'll press and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and can go.
The trainer's frustration once increased with the remote investigation on the cobalt test in which the leaders were involved and the elimination decided to show that it could "place his license" on the table.
Moody, whose name is most commonly associated with the training of the unwinned Black Caviar campsheet, labelled the treatment rule on the course day as a "ridicol" after the horses had been applied a cataplasma with namol or argule, which violates the rules.
Close the course rules.
I have to ask myself about this," he says.
One of my employees put him in a mistake.
It could have been last night.
It could have been yesterday, what happened.
He's got up on the day of the course.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the course day, consisting in the application of the cataplasm, for which stewards have discovered an investigation.
It's a crap.
People who do these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that it is necessary for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who struck and fled from the accident site in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a bicyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed the flight from the accident.
The bicyclist was transported with the helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, being severely wounded after he was struck by a car on the Murray Valley car.
Police replies that the car driver did not stop to help the wounded bicyclist.
Monday, a fifty-year-old man, was delivered to the police in Shepparton.
It seems that it will be accused of escape from the accident, the lack of the first assistant and other road crimes.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man, from Cobram, internationally in stability.
Antrenaur Melbourne Storm, ↓ig Bellamy, answers the opponents in wrestling accusations.
Antrenaur Melbourne Storm, ↓ig Bellamy, called the critics of the payment tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought in discussion of the main two famous in the NRL.
Trent Robinson, Dr. Sydney Roosters, said that the arbitraries had allowed Storm players to "take them on the trail" team in the storm winning nervous team at the end of the qualification played Thursday night at Sydney.
The entrepreneur of the Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the qualification mechanism with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday evening, when he called that mechanism a "demonstration" of the rugby leg and declared that the two teams in Queensland were not too dealing with wrestling.
Bellamy seized the payment tactics taken by his team and said that players simply focused on "contact" when they liked.
Bellamy says she got trust after two important trainers criticized her team, which means that they were worried that Storm would win.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson crying about wrestling when they bought us with score 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all the year in our defensive systems or technicals, so only in the last six weeks I have actually put the accent on contact in places and so have changed it.
Trent is in this function for three years and evidently has a great team so that it is probably not usual to lose and it was a shock for him.
We know how it always happens in this year.
Bellamy contraryed Bennett's idea to "the soul" by reminding his mentor of St. George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the campaign in 2010 by playing "playing".
Wayne's talking about a palpitant ball.
And he argumented the appearance comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how colpitant it was the game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received many critics because it was a milk team and Wayne said he didn't care about how black it was under angle.
But now he has a team that can play what I think is as a palpitant, especially because of the young rape media.
This kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two ways like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play so.
It gives me more confidence that they're doing these things because they're somewhat worried about the machine with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they thought about important trucks.
Bellamy also showed that the mechanism between Storm and Roosters was a more accurate interruption related to score compared to the mechanism between Broncos and Cowboys.
The boy of Broncos was probably a good bitch, I haven't seen him yet, how was the score? 16-12?
Our boy ended 20-18, in our game there were two more trials, that means a painting game?
Or do you mean to pause and not walk?
It's plans for me.
If I'm talking about us, it means we could meet them at a time.
Storm has free this weekend because they have won the right to play home or with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the preliminars of the living Sunday, at AAMI Park, the pictures were selling on the beginning of the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to join pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophil used the phone for a 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abusive children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept then was authenticated in a online mail service where another user sent to her a series of undesirable images having children as subject.
The girl wake up later and observed the phone disappearance that she found in Hogg's hand while she slept.
He looked at the phone and found the crazy messages after his mother was just warned.
After arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at that address and found "inquired" searches on the Internet using terms to find inconsistent images with children subjects.
Hogg claimed that he had done it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he said that he was a policeman to expect them."
Professor Eilidh Robertson stated for Dundee’s instance: “He said it was a deceit - it is to fear people.
He repeatedly made the search on the computer but he said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to fear pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations that we had made with us who sent his images and the fact that he asked them to send them more and more photos.
He said he did it to dwell.
He said he wasn't thinking clearer when he drinks and wants to see pictures of violence and crime.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried out her mother and her trembling and weeping.
The girls have seen the incredible pictures on the phone, and the accusation has been counted.
The girls were interviewed and told that the accused was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls that were much younger than he.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, homelied in Ward Road, Dundee, complained about the accusations that he had made or made photos indispensable with the subjects of children, and distorted the freedom of the 25 January this year and was not presented before the present instance on 24 March.
The lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual criminals because it could be thought that this crime “not involved a significant sexual aspect”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael took the lead in October, for social reports.
Hogg was released on caution in this folder but remained guarded before the figures for other files.
He's been in the register of sexual criminals before he's been guarded.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, sent the wrong talk to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
But it wasn't hurt, but the fall film became viral on socialization networks.
The discovery of the Parliamentary session was also troubled by representatives of a position that believed that it would have received anonymous threats to death, threatening him that he would not be able to eat Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was cut off during his parliamentary speech - the speech that he repeated on Tuesday.
Boss of the Parliamentary Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven politicians in one position received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is named "Death", he told the newspapers after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentaries because immunity applies only in Parliament and when it appears to Parliament, Parliament's immunity is no longer valuable.
The Chairman of the Parliamentary Group stated that the party, conducted by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "inquired" concerning the threats sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard's going to make 30,000 resources.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25.000 and 30.000 resources as part of the efforts of the resource and reduction costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will be divided on the board in two companies, separating the computer division and printers of corporate hardware operations and services found in luminous growth.
The preconceived availability will cost approximately $2,7 billion starting with the fourth quarter, HP stated.
"These restructuring will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise more and more sustainable on costs," Meg Whitman, President and Director-General HP, said.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP now and will hold a broad portfolio of firms that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new delay style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better placed as ever to meet the requirements increasing our clients from the world.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual income of over 50 billion dollars and will "concentrate on the supply of integrated solutions without rival" addressed to companies.
It is divided by a final company in 1930 by the University of Stanford, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the activity of the production of electric equipment and of which the garage in Palo Alto was called "the Silicon Valley".
HP passed through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest companies in the United States, is the latest in the area, based on the idea that firms who make their attention better in a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: the comic series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
Absen’s similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to go away is now more desperate than ever, the rate of suicide around young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide represented the main cause of death in men of 20 to 45 years of age in Britain, and three times more frequent to men than women.
In trying to cope with the problem, Campaign against unfortunate life (Campagn Against Living Miserably (CALM) designed 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to put under the sign of a cultural question that prevents men from seeking assistance when they need.
The appointment is in the centre of the combat to the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 school students presenting symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded enough of many friends “with a healthy state of disorder”, his recovery chances are doubled.
In the same way, for undepressed events, a circle of mental healthy friends reduces half the probability of the appearance of mental disorders.
Of course, so that friendship has an effect, this must first be able.
In this time of communication dominated by social networks, where the accent is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate character of the response is often priority for signing contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create appears to a powerful personality, lost to success and success, even if isolation is actually the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychology calls external values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of the internal values - our inner desire for personal deceit and friendship - which also affects our mental health.
The billion inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it was that he was drawing attention to this idea.
Personals were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they had by interactioning as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequencies, the moments when he looks at a bal in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this, even if they often do to explore their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me: "My role to make the trends of suicide and depressed has been as well as the smallest interactions with friends can make different."
Moreover, the calls to us are not able to talk to friends.
The old man's like to run yourself alone is powerful, as well as the feeling of being realized as weak if you're talking discovered about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes in my mind when I'm trying to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms for a long time.
The series has shown the little moments of friendship between men.
As long as the objective, external intervention, through the phone, helps people who are united at discouragement, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
So if you participate in this weekend in FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with full playing of film payments to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, you laugh and hire.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is spread by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all the 236 episodes - with the opportunity #FriendsFest
Di Maria walks and helps PSG give Malmo apart
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he marked against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marched Tuesday in his deputy boat in the Campions Liga and helped PSG join themselves in front of the Swede Malmo team.
We continue to present you the cronica of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have committed their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting a series of matches from the Ligia Campioners Groups, with a quiet victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played on Park des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria marked in less than four minutes from the beginning of his debut in the PSG Campions Liga, bringing the French camps in advantage, although they rateed a series of occasions before they ensured their advantage by the Cavani marked in a minute of 61.
By reaching the Group A near Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish camps because the goal of the French team is not only the qualification in optims but also the collection of the trip to the final sports in each of the last three tours.
But even though they took the points, Laurent Bla's students were far away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who iroised the white opportunity after which he was replaced by the team of his Natal city and the club to which he started his luminous career in 1999.
“It is not easy to win home or move to the Campions Liga, so the victory with 2-0 creates problems to our opposers and establishs a comfortable difference against the following classifieds, even if there are more aspects that we need to perfection throughout the season,” says Bla.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and do it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more.
Ibrahimovic returned after accident at one of the three changes in the team in Paris, with a 2-2 remission obtained by Bordeaux in Liga 1 weekend, but Di Maria took the reflectors in four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred by Manchester United, the argentinian offensive middleman was called the man who would lead PSG to the next level in Europe and showed this when he tried at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's army before he seemed unbelievable to Johan Wiland, in the long horn of the gate.
But if someone expected PSG to get winning from fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who won Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the ground with nine titlers to national teams, with five people and two middle defensives, was a powerful opposer.
But their attack wasn't impressive, making Nikola Djurdjic's guest that passed by Kevin Trapp's post in the minute 34.
Instead, the PSG players stopped the ritm several times, giving a few steps inutile and unfinishing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who rated not less than five trials only in the first reprise and then replaced by Cavani even after the game restarted.
But Ibrahimovic was much more understandable in supporting his colleagues, his pass, being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot of Wiland over the gate in 52 minutes.
The second empty was recorded in a final after a cross-out of the cakes, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguay who wrote the sixth empty season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This empty removed the hope of those from Malmo that they would re-equilibrate the score and only a super stop of Wiland from remotely for rejecting David Luiz maintained the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entry was cancelled an empty in long term.
The Norwegian team's entrenor in Malmo, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "The last match I played in the Campions Liga was last year."
Since then, I just played in Sweden's liga, which doesn't rise at the same level.
Califications are not enough.
Below the PSG board.
They made a great game.

Xi requires an insistent increase in the economy at the world level
March, President Xi Jin said to a group pregnant with reform that it must be widespread to the outer world to feed growth.

There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of recreation and respect for the girl of institution and tradition.
I don't know who will be, if you ask me what qualities I have to feel in the condition of the salariate girl because it's a male of the little ones coming from the employees, the reclame, the consents.

In its opinion, a maximum of 5% of the incasary committee is required.
Stelian Tanase requests decreasing the VAT cost for the specific activities of the public television post and the contribution to CCN from 15% at 3% level, but also amendment of law 41/1994, in order to receive the budget/financing opportunity for the purchase of licence for major cultural and sports events - The World Championship of Fotbal, Gold Cerbul, Eurovision.
He supports that SRTv will enter into the incapacity of payment in the following months as the employment legislation requires the employee to carry out the execution of judges, even if they are not definitive, and payment rights are respected with priority for any other obligation.
TVR has made constant effort to reduce costs with staff and TV production.
"So the movements and other cost generating activities have been reduced, a series of trade contracts have been re negotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post has been closed," it appears in the letter of the President of TVR.
Tanaza's pointing out that the disastrous financial attitude cannot be repeated only by its own efforts.
"For the explanation of State institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian TV will be found, early or later, in the ability to complete its public mission," it is mentioned in a letter.
The conduct of the Chamber of the Members decided to send the letter to the Culture Commission.

Pont, accused of uncontrolled calamities and irrational disorders
The Hungarian External Minister Peter Ssiejarto condemned the hard, Wednesday morning, the Roman Prime Victor Ponta, according to the cars of the political decisions in Hungary, "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other mighters from which the re-equivocates fled."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational initiatives, jigneste interview Hungary," the Hungarian Minister transmitted in a communicate.
European civilized politicians do not say that of uncontrolled calamities.
"His comments have only one explanation: he has lost its total extent in Romania's internal policy," he advised the leader of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Victor Ponta said that he wanted to take attention and sanctify the behavior of outermost officials, which, in his opinion, "I'm a Russian for the European Union's culture and values".
I don't want to answer the challenges come from outside representatives.
"This is a Russian for the culture and values of the European Union; and in antisemital attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the reverse crisis," Ponta on Facebook stated.
The Roman Prime Minister said that it was the adoption of reasonable and sustainable solutions in the case of the reverse crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws would not solve the problem.
Gimpate arms, aggressive laws, prisoners and brutality will not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are political decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya, or other strong ones from which these re-effects fled!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in Hungary in the last days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!", stressed the Roman executive boss.
Previous Tuesday, Minister of Foreign Hungary, Peter Ssiejarto, qualified as "single lies" comments of the Roman Prime Victor Ponta on the management of Hungarian reverse crisis, appreciating that these are inadequate for a leader of the 20th century, according to MTI.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy mentioned on Tuesday as "the extremists and false marks" of the Roman Prime Romans have internal political crisis in Romania and expressed as Budapest waiting for excuses from Romania.
Ssiejarto referred to a Monday statement from the first Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm opposed to xenophobe talks the idea of closing the granits, as everyone who comes is some terrorists, they're stupid by the Medium Eve and I'm totally opposed to this border.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics to treat those people as some people, not how they treat our older, battle, and insertion.
"But this I'm not agreed," the Roman executive boss, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
All Tuesday, Peter Ssiejarto announced that the Budapest Government decided to begin the preparations in the territory for the extension of the border with Romania of the guard he built at the border with Serbia, to make the girl of a possible change in the road used by ́nts.
Later, Prime Victor Ponta stated that Hungary's decision to bring a granite guard does not solve anything from the problem of repeat and "scoat Hungary in Europe".

How Hagi closed the mouth of the contestants
As regards many of the greatest Roman historical, Gica Hagi was labelled after the retraction of the activity, as a weak trainer, which cannot be able to perform perfectly and in the new position.
Following an unfortunate experience in the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took the role of training at the future Constanta, the team that she patronized.
After a year from the receipt of the team, the King showed that it was able to transform a team that was running to save from backward into one of the top.
So, after a year, the future recorded, with Hagi's entrenor, 16 winners, 11 puzzles and 11 infrastructures.
The bilant is one of a top team, which is fighting for European coppers.
The things took a better tour for the Future in this season, entered the team reached two places in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future has the best attack in Liga 1, with 20 gours (equal to Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy to promote young people, and at the last time in the start team, they appeared names like Yanis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The Club Policy made in the future a team for strange teams, so Hagi sold in this station 1.5 billion euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 billion euros).
Alatures de Steaua, the future is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to the data from the Comercial Register.
In the reverse crisis, Romania has played as a little bit.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask you to be treated for the seventh end of the EU.
Great tariffs come with EU interview solutions, Christian Ghinea, member of the college Director of the European Policy Centre.
In an interview granted by Daire.com, Cristian Ghinea seemed that Europe cannot be transformed into a force, and the policists will not work in this crisis: "We may have a double girl of the quality of those people."
But there's tables that started and we can't return the story.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we find us in a extremely emotional moment, where politicians feel that they need to show their muscles.
After he goes over, the Europeans will not be willing to reject freedom, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now as a animal created at the other time and which has not been adapted for the discussion."
Where are we in the crisis of the re-reactions after this JAI who actually did not solve anything?
It is clear that the EC presidents in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote.
All the prognoses said that it had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of uniformity is applied in JAI and any State may block any decision.
Thus, things have been very smallly integrated in the area of justice and internal activities.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has initiatives, is applied, and the approved by the vote of 55% among States, which is 16, which represents 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes exist.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because there is a question, rejection reactions even in Germany have occurred against Merkel's cancellation policy and have not wanted to appear as a reaction of the type "EU sent us to head".
They did so, but the problem is that this wall, obviously, creates a huge problem for the Schengenman and we will probably assist great changes there in the following period.
So the obligatory costs weren't actually eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to be stuck?
Yes, on the other hand, it is said of a greater involvement of Frontex's Agency in the management of external borders, which means a change in the individual ability of members in Schengen's external border to the Community agents.
Greece's grant with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this valiant has given the terms of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be revoked, according to the carriage of the state in which the first time is entered, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece's captain, you can't say infinitely that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Because the problem is common, is there possible a solution without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to provide the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the obligatory sides will work if they reach them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will take up their heads: you're going to X or Y.
It will probably reach some unique centres of filtering, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum requests are delighted.
It's working on such solutions.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They are strong who have ten years of experience in trying to integrate, they are strong without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrations will increase the xenofob current.
Of course, we are talking about millions of people in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in a preliminary camp and who have just started to go to Europe.
A love says that only 10% have taken away, the winter is hard for the Mediterranean past, but we waited for the next year to a valley may even be bigger.
What are we doing with these men?
My prophecy is that we're going to be aware of this problem, we're not looking at it so disastrous at median point.
You're talking about little or greater experiences.
Do you think there is a place where it has succeeded truely to integrate large groups from a foreign European culture?
Look at the magrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still inslaved.
I'm not going to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficulty than in other values, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't integrate anyway.
He collected a non-integrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But in the case of the police, they will not work.
We're creating Europe's strengthening and illusional.
It must go to integration mechanisms in European society.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pleasant.
Let's ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to raise any more with a feet in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through the council households.
But it must separate the problem of these people's alignment of the long-term problems of their integration.
If others succeeded in the long-term integration, it doesn't mean we should look at them as they were in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have a double girl of the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, it doesn't mean that it's going to go back over the night and you can take it back.
Until the solutions are presented, we see strongly in Europe.
Granits have been locked, walls are raised, controls are returned to the frontier in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project is not so, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and setting the rules so that the pressure was too large on the tariffs where the feet was placed for the first time.
I mean, we've been free down there, but everyone's with his problems.
In front of such a valley, it can't be like that, because some mighty people don't do the girl.
When there are such emotional values, politicians will seem to do something, but a long term does not change a big thing.
After France's attention, we have no longer draconic anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wall of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
And it's so instabil from one week to another yet you can't make the decisions based on her.
We have a lot of talks, a lot of political declarations under the pressure to be virilious.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the child injected in Turkey and the public opinion is emotionating.
After the public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the unique European market.
And I don't think the Europeans will reject this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules, it's something else.
Schengen is now like a animal created in the second time and it was not adapted for the hope of now.
How did Romania play in this crisis?
Like a little bit, who thinks, if he draws his ears, the theme disappears.
In front of the reality of the walls, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little problem.
That's what we've done, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask you to be treated for the seventh top of the EU.
You're not, don't play at a big level.
Great taxes come with solutions to interview the EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Like Polish did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the empathy of Romans for Schengen will expire very much.
President Johannis says it might be good that I haven't come in.
So we're going from the desperation of entering into a more pragmatic position, but the goal of the rams.
Of course, there was a risk if Romania and Bulgaria entered in Schengen as a alternative way to see us.
What doesn't mean is a reason not to go into Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but it will be transformed in the meaning that external borders will become common, will be unique rules for the acceptance of migrants, single deporting rules for those who do not receive asyl, unique rules for the tariffs considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved his attention to Syria to Ukraine, no one died anymore.
Is there a connection between the two focusers, a Russian game?
Russia has frustrated power behaviour.
She thinks to be great power means to join Americans and Europeans.
In this regard, yes, there is a link.
Make the military and financial effort of Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have pulled down.
And it was good to swallow before the main or opponent was the Islamic State.
For two years, there was a fight between the regime of Assad and the moderate and muslim military, supported by the Tarses of Golf and Western.
Then the islamic state has risen and now we don't know if we want the regime of Assad to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but she can't participate in the solution.
It creates instable and haos focus that can't shut up.
But you're powerful only if you have the solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to punish time.
Probably Putin expected to make his offers, to push his buttons to solve it.
The offers are not coming because the world isn't convinced that he can solve in some way or other things created from him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are invisible.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he's.
Which button will appear in the morning.
Millions of Facebook users have been used by the "Like" button, and now the socialization network representatives are preparing another opposition, the "Dislike".
March, Mark Zuckerberg, co-funder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be currently, reports New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button will show more than a nineth of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or he raised the problem that Facebook could be a smaller friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone puts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The network users, which reached 1.5 billion active accounts, asked for a long time to have the possibility of expressing their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg further said it's not very comfortable that people give "Like" events, such as the crisis of the re-evolution, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable to give Like that post," pointed Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not received well from everyone.
"There is already a lot of hate on Facebook and on socialization networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted to this subject.
"I'm going to give "Dislike" to the "Dislike" button," he explained it.
Roger Anderson, a microbiolog in Atlanta, said that there was nothing wrong with this button, encourageing people to have Facebook opinions.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyz to eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that one button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, approaches the electoral campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 repeateds entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted On Wednesday only 70 men, a hand of thousand income to her southern border with Serbia, announced the Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared urgent state during the day in the second judge of the frontier with Serbia because of the re-flux, enclosing a main cross-border point and claiming to build a guard at its border with Romania, remembers DPA.
Masura's back to a brushing reaction from Serbia.

The "New" Seat of the Judean Council is standing.
Two constructors, in the absence
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are to be given because they have been lost more times.
Two important constructors who worked here entered in the works.
Judean Council Site of the Wasile Alecsandri will be able to give it alone.
A year and a half since the consolidation and refunding of the building work had been completed, the work did not reach half.
A last stage in the building period was consumed last days, when the National Context Solution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint of the company who wanted to take the technical project implementation contract for the works that are to be carried out.
The initial project was implemented by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the entry into ability of the builder and the break of work, negotiating procedures have been deteriorated without publishing a participation announcement with Impex Romcatel, which would update the technical project, and then organise a new licence for work.
"The transactions have not been completed by a contract, but CJ, appreciating that the proposed form would have disvantaged the institution," Razvan Timofciuc, represented public relations in the CJ.
The CJ decision on the interruption of direct negotiations was attacked by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of Justice sent the complaint to the CNSC, who rejected it as late.
This does not mean that CJ can start searching for another projector.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility of attacking the CNCSC decision to the Court of Appeal, just after a final sentence of it, can be calculated by another projector.
Thus, building consolidation works could be recovered in the next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not be much hard, but we must reach the end of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNCSC decision will be attacked or not," said Timophuc.
Consolidation operations of the former Police Question Seat began in 2011.
A first work contract was resolved in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million leahs were carried out.
The licence was revoked by the contract by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company has entered into inconvenience, and this contract has been resolved, after payment of 1.5 million Lee.
The works have been performed now in proportion of approximately 50%.
Initial, consolidation, refunding and maintenance of the building are evaluated at 7.7 million Lee.

Adventure in the rock’s time
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can create a major handbalistic competition only in 2024, and preparation of the national handball female for qualification at the Olympics Games costs property.
President of the Roman Federation of Handbal, Alexandru Dedu, declared yesterday during a meeting with the press that it is a great proud that our team has three teams in the Campions Liga groups.
As regards the National Women Handball Team of Romania, "the main objective is the qualification of the Olympics Games in Rio, but this is why it must pass two stages of caudine furniture, first the World Campionship and the second round the precalification tour," Dedu said.
We want to be very strong to be qualified at the Olympics Games.
There are few fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight.
He wants a secondary, doctor, two massers, port trainer, physical preparer, delegation boss.
They requested us to get the qualification of anything, more precise material for physical preparation, which we never heard.
This is all to reach the Olympics Games, and I'll do everything he holds on me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make perfection.
Because at the face we're in the stone time with preparation.
"The teams with which we are battled have these materials and have sometimes," Dedu said, who was trying to get the amounts necessary for the acquisition of these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH President also refers to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our ability to create a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucuresti.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is shameful to be put under the sign of the question of a European Gimnastian Campionat.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the lunch, empires have been built throughout a two-year interval.
Before 1992, in the current empire area from Barcelona, there was a bullshit, and now there has been a beauty rear.
Similarly, in London, where the Olimpiade organisation of 2012 was a success and in view of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we could build a major competition," Dedu stated.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to offer major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr. Gatzu has been civilised with a project, people have given their agreement in principle, but they have been very quickly deceived that the room will never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them we wanted, we were able to organize, and they said they agreed and invited the first match in the new room in București, and then we talk concretely.
"So we have all the discovery, and at EHF and IHF, but we have no infrastructure," explained FRH officer.
The big handbalist was avoided to evaluate the possibilities of women CSM București and HCM Baia Great to reach the final Four: "I have asked all trainers to be reserved in prognoses, that if they do not turn back against them."

We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I want the success of the sports and I have the conviction that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at 18-19 years, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends, who fixed her to realize a dream," said Dumitraş.

The jash, laughed by RATP controllers and a pluant.
For a tourist
A tourist family from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the excursion ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, my wife and I don't want to be in your town again.
They wanted to, they struck the wrong information from the planes, the injury of the RAPT controllers, and, bonus, the amendment "that the law says."
Women arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, married in a hotel in the Centre and requested tourists.
They also received a plagan where the RATP roads were passed.
"Speak" with these cards, men visited Yash.
But two days ago, they were in Copou, they wanted to come to Palas Mall.
Because she wasn't tone with billets at the Lake Park Copou station, they were based on the printed information on the pluant: that I could take it by SMS.
Nobody told them that this service doesn't exist anymore.
Trusts in the floor, they went into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions of the pluant.
Unfortunately for them, he made her appearance a RATP control team.
They said there wasn't the two-year service and it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
I'm going to see what happened in the local press, I'm coming a night before I'm visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained them, they said they didn't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very distressing.
They said that everything I can do is give us one amend instead of 2 (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to break my visit day at Jandarmery and dand the statements there!", says Ovidiu.
Finally, the family was modified because of the wrong information from the pluant and controllers who "applied the law on blood".
It's not right, and I made a session at the RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's not about money, I'm not exagered by many, but the idea is that I felt insolent.
Ghinion for Vaslu violators.
They had an accident and remained in prevention arrest.
The process of the seven violants from Vaslui moved to the Court of Apel Iaşi yesterday.
The outside magicians judged the first time for judgment at a non-public meeting where the seven young people accused of being baptized for a 18-year-old morning requested to be put into freedom.
Before the first time of the Judgment Meeting, one of the outside judges whose document, Viorel Munteanu, was distributed, formulated a request for preservation, which was accepted by his colleagues from the stage.
The Magist acted at the Court of Justice in this year, where the Chairman of the Section On Nale was the one who, on 9 April, granted a complaint formulated by four of the accused persons, providing their arrest at home.
Currently, the dossier is judged by a complete part of the judges of Maricica Mititulu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, Judge Dan An tone formulated a retention, because his daughter is in a connaij relationship with one of the violator lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vasla violators would continue to be preventional arrested.
Your nerds will be imprisoned for at least 30 days, when the judges will repeat the possibility of their freedom.
The following term of judgment will be held at the Apel Iaşi Court on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appel Iaşi, the dupe with which violatives were transported from Vaslu was involved in an accident produced in the Pacurari apartment, the car entered in Iaşi on the centurion.
Iveco's auto-user with which the seven violators were transported struck a Volks wagen autoturism that went out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to come to the left.
Douba was at the end of the Pecurari.
The car entered Iaşi here because the Penitentiari Employments prefered the route from Vaslui to Iaşi on Grajduri, then on the centurion.
They so shorted the road for a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the arrest score called another transport to get detained.
Shortly, at the place of the accident, a car was sent from the Maxima Safety Penitenciar Iaşi, who took the seven arrested and transported them to the Court of Apel.
Following the accident, no one of the arrests was hurt.
To transfer them to the other double, the guards surrounded the back of the new car, and the arrests went out fast, two and two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the vehicles were appealing to the charges to be paid," Commissioner Madallalin Ţaranu said in the IPJ.
Marines
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what it will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and reflected: the 7000 resources that Romania should and should naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant, but great number in comparison with the ability of the Roman State to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by București, in the amount of about 1500 souls, we are deeply dealing with the good solidarity intentions with the European Union expressed in the last months.
In fact, if those people really accept to establish themselves in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into the Roman society are extraordinary of small.
I'm sure they'll be the first who'll lose their patience.
Parasite of interlocutors and paralysed by a venous political class, the Roman State is impotent in all areas.
Nothing to integrate the cigarettes is just a banal example.
On this lake, any colors have not been able to abstain European funds, to make roads, gardens or schools, to ensure decent medical assistance, to gather mixture on the street, to create honourable jobs or to keep its own generation home.
Why would re-reactivation be established in a elsewhere he flees from?
But what makes a lot of miracle is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struggling with the belitic landscape of the EU's powerful states, which prove to be most generous when dividing distress with smaller countries.
Then the fearful hypocrisy of the Romans who, although have millions of roots dispersed around the world, do not accept the other - other languages, other religions, other blood.
I'm probably afraid he's not stealing any national.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many people, who, although only calls on war wars as a reason for leave, does not accept any other destination of exemption than Germany or Northern countries.
Well, not all reactions are Syrian, but in Pakistan there is no war.
In addition, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken in disappointment.
The cases must be removed, supported by some, and, stinging strictly on the political correction book, require peace and investment for countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, since then, some foreign capital in nationality -- but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romans to bear their own ears every year.
Why is he going?
In this crisis, the European Union has developed us as anchilosed, debated and deployed building.
I complained that Romania is not able to invent a draft plan, but this is that neither the EU has any future plan.
And improvizations and threats don't help anything.
Then, what else does the EU use, if the only advantage of the Romans - the right to freedom - could be discussed because of the re-evolution valleys that cross the border as a fuel?
At a time, the Syrian war will end.
But not the crisis of the people.
In the next decades, over-humanity, poverty, climate change, evacuation of resources, etc., will bring millions of dispersed people, in Asia and especially in Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not or will never be prepared for what it will follow.

Two Brothers in Tomesti have dreamed.
They were taken to hospital.
Two nine-year-old children, 11 years old in Tomesti, brothers, have cut more Diazepam pills.
They found the pastels in the house and took them out of curiousness.
Their mother followed a treatment, and the doctors were not hidden.
Children were urgency to the "St. Maria" hospital in Iaşi.
They're able to stand, as doctors say.
EXCLUSION: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age, he received a courageous gift: biological patterns
Lost in the hospital in the nearly 90s, when he had only two months of life, little, sick and unhelped, and then adopted by a stated family in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was regulated, a nice, now a blonde and beautiful girl, came back to the other in Yass with biological parents in a town of the Judge, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything about the other.
Crina will fulfil these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer to their loving daughter a bitter and courageous gift: a visit in Romania, in Iaşi, to know their unclean past.
"The zear de Iaşi", which assisted the efforts to search the family of origin after a few extreme vagi indexs, was witness to these meetings which practically break your heart.
Reporting reporters, emotions of the moments, the statements of the involved, their reactions are from movement and coplesse.
The story of Crine started 20 years ago in the Rouginosa outside, when he had only two months.
Then because of a health problem, the girl had to be interacted in the hospital, in the city.
They started to be insensitive among parents, and Mom was needed to spend the house.
He decided to keep the girl, and I was sending me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
"When I learned that he was in the hospital, it was too late," she remembered her beloved Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was interacted with her grandfather at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and the father of the girl, Costica Balcan, went to work in Alexandria, Jude Teleorman.
Their lives had to be permanently separated.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital anymore.
Inside, Crine's father went to work in another place, and returned after six months.
In time, the girl was transferred to Iaşi's hospital, and the father, when he returned, didn't find her anymore.
I think they've passed almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I'll think she's abandoned," says a family's grandmother.
Because of financial problems, Grandpa couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Since no one had any interest in the child's sorrow all this time, it was taken by the General Assistant Directory and the Protection of the Child Yaşi, which then gave it to the Bucium Placement Centre.
It was years when abandoning and adoption were more flexible towards today in Romania.
In the Bucium Centre was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a Palermo cut that wanted to have their child but wasn't able.
They loved the place of blonding Crina, and after a while, it was to move with them to Italy.
Little's committed almost two years as long as the formalities of adoption have been taken.
When I saw Crina, I felt that she was our daughter.
"It's like my wife would have given her life," he says dreaming us Salvadore, an adoptional father, while he catchs the girl's hand.
In the spring, the parents of the Crine, Alina and Costical, continued the search separately, everywhere he could.
Father asked the authorities of Ruginosa, but he didn't answer where his child could be.
The police sent them then that it was possible to be killed, but at the same parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me to the Court she was gone to Italy, Palermo.
And you're looking for her, I've not had it anymore.
We prayed to God that it should be good.
I thought about her for all the years that have passed, but it wasn't the possibility to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the sight of Crine's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents in the Redinosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife told the girl where she came and that her past was leaving her from Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a kid, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," she bears glad Crina.
And her dream was to become reality.
In March of this year, the Commissioner Romanica Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre of Prevention, Evaluation and Consultation of Antidrog Iaşi, was contacted by a knowledge in Italy, which explained Salvadore’s desire to find the biological family of Crinea.
And the search just started from a name.
On the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first time.
I only received a name, Balcan Cost, then the locality, the Red.
In a short time, I had an activity with primates from there, and I could ask if there was a local name received.
Then they gave me some indications, just that the finding wasn't the search.
"It's been last a few days to find the girl's biological father," explains the Commissioner of Rome Ichim.
In total, better than three months, they took the authorities to hold Costica and Alina, especially that everyone had the house in another place.
We started the demors somewhere in March, and in June-July, we completed the identification of biological aspects and discussions.
"I've been able to take place a first meeting in September," added Romanica Ichim.
In the weekend, Alina and Costica saw their first girl lost on the hills of the hospital in Iaşi for 20 years ago.
Father, emotionated, could almost own his tears, and his hands were scared.
She's just changed a few talks with those around.
With a week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a grandmother to us, and she's coming with the Coast of the Ruginosa.
Meetings of Crinea with Mom and Brother biologic
In the conversations with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-country university in Italy, the Costic Balcan told him, among others, that if he wanted to come back to him in the city, he would come quietly: and he could give something sheep, goat, to get a kid of his village and to break a house.
Mom's emotional, she's crying, and he's thinking that something like that can be said to her.
I'm very emotional.
I didn't think it could be like that.
I've seen such cases in the television, I've always been thinking about those years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If she could forgive me.
I hope we'll be visiting in the future.
"I hope we can keep a link," he tells us with big tears on the workers of Alina, Crine's mother, while she holds a serve in me.
In him he hides his tears, of happiness, because in short, she will see her daughter after so bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will fulfill only a few days, this month, 20 years old, try to relax like a emotional child.
She doesn't know what to do, but she's disgusting her idea will talk about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting, he's trying to collect his thoughts, because he's very much to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally those who grew up to me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a great experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there's so many things to say," Crina witnesses us.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Pia of the Union, under the beginning of the tomb, the family of Ruginosa reunites its destination with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina has 20 years ago, finishing school, after the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, its biological parentes.
No longer separate borders or countries, but only a barier: the language.
Peses that, with a translator's help, a Italian owner of the city in the centre of Iaș, have easily passed.
Those who have succeeded to make this meeting possible say that it's the first event of this kind of, and that, in the future, if the opportunity is more, they'll do it again.
It's the first event of this organized, such emotional load, and I'm gonna be successful.
We, in the Centre, have asseted activities, and most times we are associated as an institution that is only occupied with consumption, drugs.
But we're trying to repeat society something good back.
"If I'm still asked for such a event, I'll do it very nicely," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Antidrog Consoliary Iaşi.
After him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, is divided by story.
They're understanding: they have many to tell each other.
Army with guns on the pitch, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone takes his soul
The outside of the PSD office tabernacles ended an army army.
According to successful discussions, on Sunday Friday, first and most tensioned, PSD leaders agreed to suspend temporarily hostilities.
Present by the Executive Chairman of the Party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, social-democracy outside will send it a list of potential candidates to the functions of the party.
From the end, the internal war from the party seems to have just taken a pause to allow warriors to trace their soul.
Dragon didn't give a ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message in the events of now: try to find a solution to not put the party in danger.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be put at the disposal of those who want them.
"When then we're in existing," stated Mihai Chirica, the interim primary.
The two days of weekend discussions just came to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
In the elections of October, for the function of the president of the Jewish PSD branch, an accurate competition is expected.
On the short list of candidates to the main function of the party's outside branch, the state secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazare, Jewish Vasile Case and the interim President of the Judean Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could be added to the general leader Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A calculated variance is also the candidate to the leader of the PSD Jews, Christian Stanciu, where Lupu is not yet in writing, sources from the party showing that it is not interested in functions.
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in negotiations in the last days is the former leader of the branch, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is unlocked.
According to the status, including on the day of elections, can be submitted to candidates, and they would not worry anyone if it would.
"It is important that we unite, and we will also, after 3 October, have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Judean Office and all the new leading situations," stated the Quote.
In order to organize internal elections, the leading of the Jewish PSD branch will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a closer of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is in the consent on 29 September, preparing elections in practice to be ensured by the Executive Secretary of the branch, Judean Mihail Popescu, in recent relations with the camp Nichita.
In telephone contact, Cristian Stanciu has discussed the last days as leading to a "partal consensus".
There is a large ability to maintain the balance and unit in the party.
It reached a partial consensus, in order to support a unit team to take care of Judea.
"Therefore, on the other hand, there are more variants on the intentions of candidature to the PSD Iaşi presidency, which are discharged," Stanciu commented.
A judge out-of-the-case rejected the file of violators in Vaslu for the reason for con-naj
The seven youths in Vaslui's Judge condemned for violence come to the Court of Appel Iaşi today.
The Vasluen who are condemned for penalties between five and eight months and eight months and four months will present today their arguments on their freedom, after the foundation of the Vasla Judge has established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence.
The dossier was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last weeks, Judge Dan Anton, formulating a request for retention, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton called the fact that one of the accused lawyers, a lawyer Bogdan Luca, is with his daughter's lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca looks at Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the judges moved
At the end of the last week, the Court of Vasla Judge who condemned the seven young ones motivated the sense.
In motivation, the judge speaks of the difficult reaction of accusations, but also of those who supported them, claiming that such attitudes create a strong feeling of anger in the public opinion.
"Instance notes that after the time of the prevention of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not private, under the impact of the attitude of accusations, the local supporters and their supporters, a strong injury was rejected at the level of local and national community as regards the fact that the accused of serious facts are judged in a less restrictive measure," it is shown in the motivation of the Vasla Judge.
The judges also demonted the main appeal of the seven accused who during the process called the fact that the girl who violated would not be "the church door".
"Instance underlines that it is lacking of the moral relevance of the witted quality, the aspect of which the accusations wanted to demonstrate by the appeals they had formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be breaked under any pretext," it is further expressed in motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic cases, the prosperity of which have been held in the past ten years can not continue the same in the following years.
Saturday probably a little world knows who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Laburist Party in the Great Britain, many wonder how much it can affect us by choosing a political person who, as a result, is not in a decision position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leader of the labs after war.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (demanded at a time to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fero American and a sympathy of Vladimir Putin (which otherwise was invited to comment on the political events from the "Russia Today" TV channel) and the Hizbollah and Hamas terrorist moves, he wanted British rejecting nuclear weapons and getting out of the NATO and EU.
For Corbyn, who considered at that time the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is nearly preferred to the United States.
According to the model of all popular demogics, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the type of those he said and promised, and Tsi in Greece at the time he gave a piece with the real world and the economic legislation.
The economic programme of the new labour leader provides, inter alia, massive renacionalizations and the recovery of money as a solution for the finance of projects of dealing and covering very generous social benefits.
Certainly, some might wonder why the solution to spend money is not adopted on the world, then we have a global prosperity! but who can prevent such details.
Of course, we can take blood on bankers, you become a kind of enemy of the service of the left, but from what it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Holland.
Additional amounts are quickly covered by generous, uncovered, popular demagogues.
According to Margaret Thatcher, "the socialism problem is that at a time the money of others ends."
I'm giving Jeremy Corbyn real chances to come to the Prime Minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s, another radical leader of the left, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in convinces as the leader of the party, failed to regret in elections.
And then there is still a work class in the Great Britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and consistent.
And the syndicates were more important than now.
In the new industrial area, where services are dominant in the work force together, and extended automations have made in the industry a massive need for highly qualified work, Corbyn's retorn has a limited call.
However, even from a position, he can influence important evolutions that can affect us directly.
In its latest number Financial Times, Corbyn's choice increases the chances of Brexit, that is, the outcome of the British Britain from the EU.
The new laburist leader was a consistent opponent of the country's apartment in the Union.
In the radical left eyes of Brussels, it is the agent of international capitalism and a promotor of globalization that imposed the poor self-sufficiency.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration retoric, and you look at the crisis of re-emergence that swallows from the EU's foundations, you reach an explosive mixing.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if the British decisions followed by the referendum, which would take place in 2017, the Union will deal with the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the advanced falls created within the Euro crisis and now the renewals, between North and South, between East and West, leave for scenarios of the most concernful scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a contradiction to the French-German axis (which even more Berlin becomes the dominant actor).
It is true, the British environment, the City, are powerful lawyers of the country in the EU.
But Europe today is not the one in the past.
There are many feelings that grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I had even recently a demonstration in Jean Clude Junker's speech, continues to make major decisions over the head of the major major majority of the Member States by consulting only a few European powers, especially with Germany.
And this happens in the events where the electoral output for anti-immigration, which are at the same time, and the eurosceptic, grows spectaculars throughout the continent.
In other words, emotional climate with negative load has reached higher costs than ever in the past.
Where and where it takes the Financial Times when it evaluates Brexit's chances.
The EU option is based on a close calculation that moves from national interest.
If the members want to make the brain decision, then the Great Britain will be in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the current policy.
And Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
In particular, if, as it is to be adequate, we will assist to a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will bring the most of the countries in the region and the area of interest and the decision process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsi et ́sa in Greece, Podmos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its popular retorn from the frustrations collected in the western society.
For economic and demographic cases, the prosperity of which have been held in the past ten years, generous social benefits can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro zone - immigration, both caused by private decisions that have not been calculated only by the integrationist political ambitions, not by the ability and ability of the peoples and peoples in Europe to respond to such challenges, turbulences on the continent, the EU's internal pressures will increase in intensity and can affect the majority of Romania.
And it's hard to exclude something from the view of possible scenarios.
The view is if our main political leaders are able to face such complicated actions.
Constantin Blancs, the god of the land.
Rockefeller, "How can I help you?"
You said, "Take up the atelier!"
The big sculptor had a big dream: be someone, come to the celestial, hear about him in all the world.
But behind his rename, something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recorded for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "treat".
What about Constantin Blancuschi?
What else is it to say, actually?
His figure fell on the night.
And, soon, an actor in Romania has been able to play him in a public.
Fires produce and deliver money almost 60 years since there is no more among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bullevards that port their name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with the growth, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to the Blancs."
The country is distributed by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are to be low from such a world, from children, to age.
The Infiltration Capacity of Blancci is a big.
Neither communists succeeded to extinguish him from Romania's memory and culture.
His sites are currently distributing the Internet, taking hundreds of thousands of shields and shares.
And then, again, what else would he say, write about this man?
Looking out of the many books and articles that try to reconstitute its destination, the life of Brancuşi seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there's those people who tell you that, if you didn't have the pleasure to be born in a large city and in a family as much as possible, your chances of success in life are almost null.
The Via of Brancuşi is the perfect example of contrast.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe the next text should be started from here.
With a sense, whatever they're hatable.
Forget the stories of cretin success, which are delivered to you in the journal and television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he's lived, how, today, he has heard a whole mapmond?
It's simple.
He worked the whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuşi was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi日, a small town of the commune Pestishani, Judge Gorj, at the pools of the Carpates.
It's the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Brancuşi.
Although she came into a stated country family, Branchus leads a modesty life, but one of them would be able to collect her reperties that will guide her artistic vision late.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grows, the artist would be witnessing, at a meeting with Peter Czechland, from Paris, in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
Thousands, people lived, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from an anotimp to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The big city civilization has reached us.
But Brancuşi's childhood was far away from an idolic.
One of the moments held in those early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that have characterized the future of the sculptor years spent in nationality.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancuşi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancuşi was three years old.
In the tomb of that year, when the "la casan" kids were made, following those who shoot the liquor to see whether the process is executed as necessary, Brancusses takes a time of general disappointment.
He fills his socket of palms with kitchen and drinks the unsuflated.
He falls in a nearly instinct sleep.
The first people's noticed just after a few minutes.
Mom's in panic, then in his historic, thinking his son's dead.
On the evening, when the father, Radu, turns back from life with praisemen, he sees from separating the desperate signs of those who hold him with his soul to the mouth.
The festival is immediately transformed into jail.
Dad's already thinking about the funeral.
Nevertheless, somebody thinks it's good to call Baba Brandusha, the doctors and the servants of the Branchs.
The bridge checks the breath of the child, then puts it under the nose of the horse balls, gathered in the neighborhood.
The strong stranger kid.
The world's applauded.
While the widow is allowed to sleep along with his beauty, the festival with praise continues with even more strength.
The second day, the father and the son are meet by the league.
Radu Brankushi puts Constantin to gather the news and bring them.
Father puts his child down with his head and, with the knifes brought to bear, he bats him to keep his mind.
And while he feels the stumbling of the swords, the small Branch has the revelation that the world can be seen and in another perspective and that things around can look back.
In particular, the position of the sun, different from the good, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in the elderly, if he himself doesn't participate in his disappointment.
Should the sun also be as painful as his father for what he was doing?
At the current time, the city doesn't work
A parliamentary calls for politicians to remember those who voted on them.
The independent Member Viorel Bleijuţ invited PSD and PNL to stop the internal lights and reorient its agenda to the electorate.
What we now see on our political scene is a big discovery.
I didn't see anything of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
Neither autoway nor Regional Spital de Urgences, you see just how politicians have their possible widths depending on immobiliary interests.
Let's go a little away from the politics, gather and talk.
Now, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you've got no time for those who chose you," said Blajutz.
He said that the current political class has decreased the outside electorate, consequently to be a very reduced presentation to the lives of local elections, around 30%, representing the faithful electorate of the parties.
The Member also believes that the people will go all towards the traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, as is the "For Yaşi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and they will only do to break from the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civilian active people, which are usually right.
"There is more right, which is not good for nobody, neither for PSD," said Blajutz.
He claimed that he was not interested in a candidate to the local elections, dismissing the sounds about his intention to register in the course of Primation.
I've said I didn't want to candide to any local function.
I'm still thinking if you're going to continue as a deputy in the future mandate.
I tried to call for a unit for Iaşi and in the holiday discussions with other parliamentaries, and I was accused of making my pictures.
They don't want, but we can't keep that anymore.
"If people have voted on us, they don't mean that they're proud to vote on us again if I don't see anything," said Blajutz, who said that the main reason why electoral is no longer interested in politics is the choice hypocrisy.
A colleague in Tatterass said I don't get his money and I have to go with the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
It's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed of getting the money from the casier.
At the end of the mandate, I will make a report with everything I've spent, outside the salaries of employees from the cabinet and the maintenance of it.
He was going to lift up in a month and 30,000 lions, with all transport, apartment and other deconts.
"Let a parliamentary say that it doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blyjutz finished.
