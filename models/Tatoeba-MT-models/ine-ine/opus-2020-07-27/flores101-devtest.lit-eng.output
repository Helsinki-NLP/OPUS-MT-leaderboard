The first population has not changed completely, but they still need the same adjustment.
When running, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look even less similar to other populations.

The travel flow shall be subject to the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, the running stream is adequate because it cannot be intended for a hundred percent of drivers' behaviour.
It is good that the drivers are walking quite equally on the road, so the running flows have a certain coherence and can be approximately calculated matematically.
In order to better translate the run stream, set three main characteristics of the connection: 1) area, 2) speed, and 3) speed.
