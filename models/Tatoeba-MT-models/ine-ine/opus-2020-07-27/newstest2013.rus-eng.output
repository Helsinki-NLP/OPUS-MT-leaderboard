Response of the Opposition to the Recurrence of Obama
The leaders of the replies justified their policy for the need to combat false choices.
However, in the Centre of Brenna, it is considered the last myth, acknowledging that the cases of false choices in the United States are more rare than the cases of death in the fall of molecules.
Furthermore, the reporters of the Resp of the Canadians counted only 300 cases of electoral falses in the United States in 10 years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on the electoral shipment.
In this regard, such actions are partially discriminated by the American Democracy System.
Despite Canada, the United States are responsible for federal elections in the United States.
That is why the majority of States governments have adopted laws that complicate the registration or voting process.
This appearance has received a new disruption after elections in November 2010, which have brought 675 new people in 26 States.
Only one year 2011, 180 legislative projects were adopted in 41 states.
The new election law requires the elector to confirm the person with graphy and the evidence of the presence of the American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the period of a long-term vote, exercise the right to register the elector on the day of release and dismiss the right to vote in the citizens who have jurisdiction.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state had the electors obligation to declare the identity certificate with graphy.
Indiana became the first state that introduced such a requirement.
The United States High Court confirmed the constitution of the law adopted in India in 2008.
The Republic of the Republic has succeeded to distribute this issue to other states.
During the last two years, they have initiated drafts of legislation that the electors are committed to providing a certificate of persons with graphs in 34 states.
It is important to note that, despite Quebec, the American citizens do not have such a universal identity certificate as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million people who have reached the need to vote for age, have no certificate of identity with the graphy issued by the Governing Body of their State.
Furthermore, five million new electors have no such document in 2012.
The valuation of the required person certificate often exceeds $100.
New income benefits from young people, minorities and low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of Afro-Americans, 15 per cent of people who have less than 35,000 dollars, 18 per cent of citizens who are 65 years older and 20 per cent of electors from 18 to 29 years have no needed identity certificate.
But that's not all yet.
Students who believe to vote for democracy candidates are not allowed in several states to use the certificate of the person with the graphy issued by their training.
The same states have therefore permitted members of fisheries and ­new clubs voting mainly for the replies of the candidates to vote on the certificate issued by these clubs.
By 2004, none of the States required evidence of the presence of the American citizenship for voting.
The first such request was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws required by electors to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are obviously intended to continue the vote of outputs from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American electors are deemed to vote for the Democracy party.
Furthermore, the republic legislators initiated in 2011 laws entitled to electors on the day of vote in eight states.
They also had the right to assist individuals or groups who want to register themselves.
This has not been done without consequences.
For example, during the elections of 2004, the election campaign on the registration of electors helped approximately 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures adopted since 2009 led to 17% of the registration level of new electors in 2010 compared to 2006.
In five other states, the recipients of the Republic adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of vote.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors were afro-American, although only 13 per cent of the total number of national electors.
The same happened with Latin America's outcomes.
Only 11 per cent of the electors constituted 24 per cent of citizens who voted at a time.
In contrast to whites who, in the form of 76 per cent of the electors, constituted only 46 per cent of the votes.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their parties are actively expressed against the adoption of the electoral laws.
A number of draft laws were welcomed by democracy Governors.
The most insignificant laws were suspended in the interruption of the United States Prosecutor-General.
This allowed partly to have negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of 34 states were adopted laws required for the certification of the person with the graphy.
Nevertheless, the new rules that are involved will certainly be difficult for the election of 2012 election rights.
Democracy critics condemn the adoption of laws that have been adopted by seeing that they are obvious to affect the results of the elections in 2012 in key States.
The report of the Centre of Brennan from 2011 shows that the states adopting these laws represent 171 of 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential elections.
Too early to be assured that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will affect the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
Only one thing is uncertain: these new positions will have a negative impact on the electoral box.
In this regard, such actions are partially discriminated by the American Democracy System.
Screening the iron cancer: to test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives mistakes, false negative, and sometimes liars, which lead to medical interaction.
Mans, and so no dispanzerises are going through, and there are more doubts.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked two experts.
In studies in the United States, many infections were observed among the investigated groups, so the data obtained were difficult to interpret and you did some clear recommendations.
Another study, this time, has found a different level of employment in patients who have passed the scanning, and those who have not passed it.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the 30-40 per cent of the metastase is likely to be shown to those who have not been scanning.
So I would recommend that a test begins from 50 years, or 40, if one of the famous relatives had a prostate cancer.
African men of origin are also higher risks.
The key is to make the right decision as only cancer is found.
Cancer can be as aggressive as well as vital.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer disease without the obligation of treatment of prostatic cancer, which is not a risk of life in long-term life, but a choice, in these cases, for an active monitoring of disease.
Today, many men who have discovered cancer will not go through the treatment course, since their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to life.
We will keep them actively watching, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start the treatment.
We are often determining the criteria to make decisions about who or who should not take the treatment course.
So I'd recommend to go through the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to take the test.
In collaboration with the International Urology Association, Movember created a tool to evaluate all for and against the test of the PSA.

Prevention of illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific studies, the health care of life remains a better way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is considered that if all people were healthy and moved enough, 30% of the cases of cancer could be prevented.
"If nobody would smoke anymore, this number would grow up to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bole, press secretary of Cancer Association of Canada.
However, estimates that 10 per cent of the cases of cancer are caused by heritage.
Some types of cancer remain completely unexplainable.
For the Canadian Association of Cancer to Pump, it remains a priority, despite decreasing the number of tuberculosis.
It was 85% of the cases of cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It brings the colossal health of people.
"Thus today, in Quebec, 1.5 million bulks are counted," says press secretary Andre Bole.
Expected fact: after 10 years of refusal of smoking, the risk to die from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the CAR, the weight and breast-feeding also contributes to disease.
They increase the risk of providing the cancer of milk, milk and straight stick, feedingwater, footwear and motherfucker cancer.
"The investigations are that the regulation of physical activity throughout the life protects from the cancer of stomach," adds the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends the consumption of red meat.
In too large, it increases the risks of the potato cancer.
It should also be avoided from colbase products.
Conservation of meat through pressure, sugar or salt may lead to the training of officers.
"The latests can bring the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin additives on cancer development.
However, the results of these studies are to be called unique.
The SCC states that vitamin E studies are contrary to results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostatic cancer development, the other resulted in the opposite.
Assessing the impact of vitamin cancer D is also not fully clear.
However, Mr Boljo stresses that its concerns and family anonymity are important to discuss with the doctor.
"The fact that an analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Bozon in Detail
Last year, the report that scientists may have been able to find the Higgs Bosson has caused a real age - not without age.
It seems that this bozon explains the mass of all parts in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is after the part of which the standard model has been predicted - our best, or, in any case, "the less uncomfortable" description of nature and the behaviour of the material - which was not already able to find an experienced way.
But the physicians are still not sure that it is about the Higgs boss.
We know, without doubt, that we have an actually new part and that it reminds very much of the Higgs Bozon, predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented on one major Office of the Congress in Kyoto on this week confirms that, although certain data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's imagine, however, what about the Higgs bozon, because the chances of mistaking seem to be minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is completely unsecure, that two things cannot be shown at the same time.
It has no possibility to do this rule, not even try too amazingly, elsewhere.
But although the physics of elementary parts is a quite strange world, it also shows that there is one law of such nature: the principle of Paul's exclusion, which stood that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time, if they remain in the same "quant status" is "so" in general, in some of their characteristics.
From this, physicians divide parts into two categories.
In one corner, we find well-ordered citizens called farmers who are well subject to Pauli's principle.
On the other hand, bozons, the band of an ants, which have no respect for anything - at least this principle, meaning that they can be quietly at the same time.
As the site reports, Particle Adventure of the Berkli Laboratorium, these bozons are divided in two groups: the mezons that we will not talk about here, and the "participants of force", through which the main natural forces are spread and to which the Higgs bozon will be in some kind.
These bossons should be highlighted, not all exotics as possible.
Actually, if you can read this chronic, this is through an incredible banal bosson: a "party of the light", which is the "currier" of the electrical power.
In fact, when a part of the electrical load has or changes the direction, it "inhibits" the electrical field in this specific area, as well as the stone brown into the dust.
From this "needs" is born a electro-need wall (light, or infrarroad, or ultrafiolet, etc.), and this wall is nothing else - and therefore one of the "power transferers" bozons.
More Stable Field
The same is happening with the Higgs bosson, with the only difference that to make this bozon appear, the other field, the Higgs field, must be "sustained".
However, the Higgs field is much more stable and more stable electricity of the field; to raise it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if something was about the cracked rock, the surface of which could only be cut a very big stone.
That's why a huge holder of parts like that exploited in the CERN, the Great Adron Collyder, which is a ring of a diameter of 27 km!, to achieve such great energy.
Analogia with the electrical field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs bosson and the mass.
In fact, not all parts or materials are interacting with the electrical field.
As for example, those who are involved, others are not: the paper papers, for example, will never be held on the refrigerator.
In the same way, not all parts are interacting with the field of Higgs: those who work together have a mass, while others (as men) do not have it.
What, then, is "the possibility of bringing" all these studies, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
They are used in science to verify the standard model correction, which also allows physicians to get a difference between the results of observers and SM prognoses.
Furthermore, some of them wish to find that such disappointment, i.e. the smallest incompatibleness can open the door for " new physics" and lock some models.
After it is said, it still has deficiencies without any explanation for gravitation (oh!) or for dark material that forms approximately 80% of the Universe (oh!).
But it wasn't found in the CER.
Consequences
According to these studies for the lives of the medium-state of the human being, it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: At the beginning of the 60s, the pioneers who studied laser in Bellas labs could not even assume what revolution they would call for.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, a relaxed physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bellow Labs, where in 1960 was obtained a laser, and who himself was the first uninterrupted laser (earlier were impulsive) in 1962, said that the lazer was initially considered more than the "laborator paper".
Imagine...
Furthermore, the application can be found for an investigation tool.
For example, the same Willyard Boyle during his optical studies in 1969 had a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it wasn't his original destination, now serves as a "oce" for all the digital cameras of the world and has deserved the Nobel Fisic Prize in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Colleder will necessarily change the life, but it only shows that it can be.
Politiative assistance is the best way to die... "Debt"
The Commission had recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec.
The debates should be renewed and the legislative project will be prepared at that time.
However, there is much to do in this important area.
"Long" tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monteregi.
The cancer of the prostate who disrupted it inside is due to a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lies in the bed in Victor-Gadbua's palatiative outcome in Belarus, where the penalty came.
"But it's always a shock, it's not easy to prepare for it," he says.
The disease makes its own: an incredible ability that does not allow to walk into the toilet and even to eat itself.
As he sits at the table on which the appetite dinner is held, he agrees and agrees to help him take food.
He wakes up, even smiles, talks to strangers who work around him, brings him medications, leads him to the bathroom.
Courage before usual death.
"My greatest desire to cure me from the diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a medicine from this disease.
"During our life, we learn that a man must stand," says Peter Broder, psychologist in Victor-Gadbua.
Regressing to the status of the child is an unnecessary humiliation for some.
"All depends on the ability of man" to be humbled with a disaster, he says.
Since many people believe that they are involved in palyative efforts, important events are even in the most disturbance of this accident.
Patients who have progress in the palatiative place Viktor-Gadbua are all sick.
The predictions lead to them for three months of life.
At that stage, the team of doctors and sisters does not provide any more assistance called "therapy".
Mrs. A., 89 years old, most fearing to die "in the conscience of an oath".
But the sickness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in my life," she says before she allows her to put a mask that makes her an easier breathe.
She remained in the days of the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In Viktor-Gadbua, a volunteer group provides for the body and food assistance.
This is a palyative approach that remains when nothing more does.
To make death more comfortable.
Each 11 700 inhabitants in Quebec have one place in the paliative aid institutions.
It's very little, because we're all going to die early or lately.
Here the life continues under the best conditions that are, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the hospital.
Be comfortable to be physical, emotional or emotional.
When we die, we will agree to deliver the mouth of the bridge or the pepse, seeing what he will ask.
The diabetes are no longer forced to control the level of sugar.
And death is part of everyone.
Yesterday evening we brought Mr. H.'s beer that died tonight.
On the morning his son dropped the beer in his legs.
"We're helping nearly as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of the illness.
Victor Gebbua's holiday doesn't look like a previous day.
By birth to a 93-year-old elder who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the court, putting on his bags during his toast, tragically dies a young man of 36 years, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children, and triing everything to survive.
"In the last half of three to five cocks, cancer diseases are always taken up to 45 years of age," Dr. Christian Martel says carefully.
53 per cent of patients receiving Victor Gadbua are coming from home and 47 per cent from hospital.
The problem of access to a paliative access
77 per cent of the canadians simply have no access to a paliative approach, which is provided to facilitate the suffering of sick people in the final stage of their lives, either at home, in hospital or at the hospital.
And some institutions such as Victor-Gadbua and the Paliation Community at the Grand Montreal House are specialised more or less exclusively on the emergency of cancer diseases.
Exactly this big space in Quebec's healthcare system causes many doctors - specialists to fear the adoption of a law that enhances evtanase and self-mortal assistance.
Since October, the manufacturer signed by the flashing lights in the area of the paliative access, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernar Llapunant, and testifying that they have no such initiative.
According to Dr. Cristian Martel, the health protection system of Quebec is not sufficiently effective to ensure the right to a paliative approach to high quality before a transition to Euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, - she says, - I have seen a patient who has spent 14 days in the swift assistance, in diseases, and no one has taken the measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate exit.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic predicts.
The hope of the survival of Elena Richard was already minimal when she stopped the exhaust chemotherapy.
When I told my ancholog that I stop treatment, she replied that she was sorry to stop fighting, she told me.
She told me that my days were counted!
There is no progress
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of those who ask for death thank the medical staff for not complying with their request after the paliation team facilitates their pain.
However, it is necessary to note that the palyative approach is not absolutely complete in the fight against pain.
According to Elsey Monroe, the Paliative Access Director in the Community for the Paliative Access to the House of the Great Monreal, patients are not eligible for insurance in 8% of the cases.
At the end of life, doctors are often attending a paliative session where the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or permanent.
No longer assume that we don't know these sufferings.
More frequently and more, as the pain that is not able to facilitate can have access to a paliative seat.
Because those who suffer from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to make my eupthanasia," that means "I want to be more spectacular."
This report has become aware of the journalist graph of the Canadian Health Research Institute.
Grand scale scandal in Quebec
The obligations responsible for the building of the roads, building subsequents, collecting political parties and Italian mafia specialists on day after day are reporting that they know about the classic " system" of building industry, public servants, politicians, professionals and mafia.
"Industria", which was very precious for Quebec tax payers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's anxious how this system is disappointed after all the means has been put into operation, Jack Ducheno, Deputat and former Monreal Police Boss."
Exactly thanks to him in 2011, the scandal was a side effect of the investigation of office crimes with road-building contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister at that time, Jean Share, agreed very unfairly.
The Ducheno report has established a close relationship between industriality, secretization of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasises that only the Ministry of Transport would keep dollars on contracts," if some had stopped their instincts to take part.
The Charbonno Commission "has already mixed two members" adds, hoped that she will "hide the schemes behind the persons".
Permanent Division for the Conflict of Corruption, established in 2011
The case was established in 2011 by the Permanent Department of Combating Corruption, which included an extensive State of Governing Auditors, Researchers and Analysts.
Furthermore, the special " Molot " Department " which after 2009 were replaced by Montreal to stop the rate of contracts.
During the last weeks, a series of visits, and some municipalists, in particular Franco Zampino and Rishara Market, had been charged with a small city of charge and corruption.
On the other hand, Gile Wayancur, recently departed from the city of Laval, the third of the province of Quebec.
It is suspicious of the recovery of a sum on public orders.
Furthermore, the official accusation was submitted to several engineers through the communications of Montreal and the constructives of the Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The latest exploded the actual bomb with the follow-up of the " system" of public contracts.
During a few years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the rate of contracts captured in Montreal, a mediator with mafia, who, in turn, translated the money of Mr. Gerald Tramble's "Observed Monreal" party.
In the 2000s, Zambito washed with money right and left, and numbered more than $88,000 of Canadians (approximately 68,000) to different parts of the province, mainly the liberals of the authorities.
Moreover, he admitted that he collected illegal funds for the former Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Canalisation contracts which increased value
The "system" corruption worked in Montreal.
Gile Surprenan, former civil building engineer, described it before the Commission: in ten years, he received from the building firms of gifts, invitations in driving, to golf tournaments, restaurants, hocking hook and totally 736 000 dollars in exchange for channel contracts that he had increased.
Other Officers responsible for the road building recognized that they had been obtained on a lap, exceeding the accounts of 30-40 per cent with false supplements.
Then, a manager of the Measurer party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tromble that he had closed the eyes of the parallel budget that filled partial cash with disgusting money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trumble went to the depth of the beginning of November, carrying Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputats in Montreal, killing anxiety.
Mar of the River-de-Prery district on the east island, it is opposed to the sale of a municipal department buyed for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to the building paper.
70 per cent of money in pre-elected campaigns
She says that in an investigation, which finally will be started, it "will be for a point that allows the functioning of the system of murmurs to stop the gangrena and to determine the guilty".
This process is characterized as "male but ill."
We are in the process of cleaning of the wound, but Montreal will have its own investigative group and observation to avoid the return of doubts.
How we go home.
Regu's fine.
Jacques Ducheno notes that "the operators stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially concerns the role of "elected officers, knowing about this scheme", but not participating in migrations.
Since the share of money in the selection campaign in Quebec reaches 70 per cent, he shouts, "I said that it was just a bleeding reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec will have up to 100 dollars on partition, but it will not change the situation: "Before we are going to take the choice costs, the political money will be deteriorated."
He requires a full restructuring of the system of public contracts and party supplies: "We can't go down; we will be able to build a house on a more sustainable fund, with better control and legality."
If this story and put the shadow on the image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls those who laugh to look into their own court...
"PSI isn't the FC Barcelona!"
At this season, you've been incrediblely discharged at the PSH.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual conscience, but may be by a new measure of PSI.
Great players arrived.
I'll be born with them every day.
Technical staff has also contributed much.
These factors urge me to raise the level of my game every day.
And in the morning, it's easier.
Everything happens very quickly in the football.
But I'm not burning.
Since the beginning of the Preliminary Preparation Centre in the NIF in Clerfonten and before my arrival to St. Ethen, I have always passed forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
The full of this year is not to play a very high level of maturity.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to that such a player like me wants to be at the level and to be trained by mom.
Carlo Anchelotty also supports my position.
He helped him to replace those like Claude, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelots are the master's positions?
Of course.
Anchelotty gives respect to all the technical staff.
Today, he has no part in the First Law and is involved in the number of best trainers.
He has an extensive experience, and he has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles in Paris.
In January, I had a hopeful conversation with him.
Then I left the whole series of trauma.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
What are you thinking about the first part of the PSA season?
Lion took a leader's place in the First League.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the Champions Lig: we have been effectively qualified to one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
Everything can be from now on.
We can say our word face to face with very good Peeis teams.
We dream to finish the first of our group before Porto to have the opportunity to take a responsible match at one eighth end.
Can the PSH become the first-classed Pei's club in a short-term perimeter?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major cup of Peeis, Paris must win titles and strengthen the positions for long-term perpetuation.
It's not right today.
Financially, the PSH has a means to make this project real.
Don't you take the title in the First League, like last season, would be a big loss?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this campaign title.
Last season, we were close to this.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished him with 79 eyes.
Normally, 79 pounds have a champion call.
But the other team, Montpele, played a more tastical season.
This year, I think it'll be okay.
Despite the fact that the teams like Marshall, Leon and Bordo have been in the fight against the title, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the MMI's waiting for too much from the PSI?
It's normal that we expect a lot, taking into account how many players and players we have.
We're completely ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win at home 4-0 against Trua, and yet we find what to discover, of course, it's a little disturbing.
We're asking what people are waiting for.
We will never be able to win each output with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The command is formed with time.
We proved in the Champions Life that we could respond to modern calls.
Look at Manchester Younate, whose two seasons haven't been able to go to one eighth end, although they've also spent great money!
Taking into account the amounts, we represented you for 15 points before the winter break.
It would be a disappointment to our opposers and to France's campaign.
Leon and Marshall, who were not at the height of the past season, were "expulsed" by this new CSI.
This shows the attractiveness of the First League.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that despite all difficulties, we have won.
PSJ, fully depends on the submissions of Golden Ibrahimovič.
Well, what if they say there's some gold dependence.
This only means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he loses many.
He came to it and proved that he was the star of the First Ligue.
Where he was playing, he showed that he was a big player and a world-scale star.
In the group, we view him as a human and a player.
He also respects people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This stimulates others to improve their game.
The Thiego Silva, one of the best protectors in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive from France's collection?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to do this with warm desire.
Unfortunately, my trauma stopped me to break a little game time.
I saw many things there, and I went out there more.
Today, I can play good team bags.
That's what I hoped since my baptism in the Blue.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be a model.
What do you think of the first months of Diddy Desham in the Bluehead?
They're resulting for him.
He has good positions in the team to the world campion.
He's a strict trainer, he's close to players and inspires a victory.
What was Laran Blan?
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan has reached his goal, he's a quality of us.
I hope Diddy Desham will bring Blue to Brazil.
The good deserved nine (1-1), expelled on October 16, Spain is a basic muddle?
This catch believes in us.
Everybody was fighting for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, my career wasn't like a bitch.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Full opposition to the current daily exchange at the central banks held between the recipients and the Commission assemblies on them.
Furthermore, how often these technologies occur, it is obvious that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
Actually, Bitcoin, obtained by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonim), is a virtual currency (but converted to dollars, ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol that allows the exchange of files between participants of one level.
Approximately 200 000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of sites are able to be acquired or as a means.
The curse was a battle curse, with 30 dollars (23°) in June 2011, and five months afterwards fell to 2 dollars before returning to about 10 dollars today (courses indicated on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing especially compared to global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the Central Bank (ECB) was interested in its report on the virtual currency on October.
He describes the bitkin as "the most successful virtual currency", "the competition with a dollar or" and "the normal currency".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "kredits" used for moving in video games that are employed in the game process or which are possible to buy (and sometimes to exchange).
The Facebook social network also had a similar system.
But exchange operations always control and process any central body.
In Bitkin, all the nodes of the network I'm at the same time holders of the book, the auditors, the currencies, the buyers and the sellers.
How does this network work?
Each trade between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like the e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, providing anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically with the use of the double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file may be checked that the bicycles used in the negotiation are actually in the public account book transmissed throughout the network.
The key is to register the new transaction in this book.
It takes the matematic solution of the task sent to computers that, like a timely central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
The fact and fade of the file cached, which means converting the large file into digital signature, short and unique.
Computers will take a new transaction and add her number before "shashing" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is right.
The transaction is thus irreversible with all other transactions; any modality will change the digital signature.
If the user would like to pay two times with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be under the network, and the other would remain unless they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that decided the task is 50 bits.
In order to avoid inflation, the regal recompense is probably divided to halfs until the end of 2012.
The number of bitkins in the treatment is therefore 21 million, but they are dead up to one billion, which remains in the reservation...
The complexity of the task is also increased by calculating power.
The network's life has already survived the outputs and falls.
The Bitcoin services sites were attacked and the battles were stolen from the reserves.
"Iso-deficiency does not coincide with the protocol itself," assures Peter Nuaza, who recently started Paymium - a real money-payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of recovery of money through this anonymous service.
But the money is also insufficient.
Great players, such as Wikipedia, are refused to accept such practices.
Others, such as blog-plat_ WordPress, allow them.
Recently, Ady Shamer and Dorit Ron from the Witzman Institute in Israel analysed the account book and discovered that almost 80 per cent of the battles were not in the trade.
"Gigantic sales" were announced in November.
"Treenty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works in Coinabul, who is being converted into gold.
Pier Nuaza, another credit author for this currency, believes firmly that this technology is a operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is a credit card equivalent (in current money) or an uncontact payment via a phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check the transactions so that it comes out.
The equipment better controls its similar data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for enterprises who do not need to set up new devices or software.
It is only enough to report the address that can be "fotographed and recognised" by the phone, Pier Nuaza, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to review hierarchy systems for more horizontal benefits.
"Before Bitcoin will be approved for a while, but 2013 can be a return moment," he foretold.
In its report, the ECB suggests, in fact, to review the various risks that today are considered higher in the case of the success of this system.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French army left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Suroba).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghanistan Army, it was time to return control over its territory, and for the Afghanistan to choose their future, not only in our hope.
We suffered mainly from Afghanistan baptisms that we considered as terrorists.
And we, with 88 killed soldiers, and we were hurt and killed.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, such as commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but also often from baptisms refusing the presence of the foreign army, as was in the SSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaetic, even gihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbeki, Tajikians.
They are suffering, sometimes helping those who are rebellious, but they will be no longer, unless the West will be more delicate.
The outcome of the French army from the Nidgerab base, which I observed from the height of the hills of mineral trees by the French credits, was fine.
Convoys of carriers and carriers have reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no taxes on Cabul .
The circumstances have changed from the time of their immediate movement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Cabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country was then considered their kind of freedom, return to security.
The Afghanistan women paid for the darkness of those baptisms in which Al-Qaida had overcome them, but their situation was not improved in our day.
Earlier mojacheds, the Afghanistan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to maintain women in a subsequent position.
Basic persons of Antisocia war returned to the authorities in 2001.
They became parts of the country capturing to re-sell them under the construction of repatriants returned from Iran and Pakistan, using a huge American subsequent contracts.
They are discreded; most of them were not even fighting themselves.
People, as I heard in the landscape, want a government that would not be of the wild.
Many young people want to leave how those who have been aware of the American generosity will go.
Young people have been rescued from war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the release of Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated his privileges.
Approximately 65 per cent of the population is age to 25 years; now 5 million people are counted, one fifth general population.
State schools in towns are filled with boys and girls.
It is necessary to ensure the places of slaves of these young people who are not going to return to the darkness of old parties or to the corruption of some ru-human people.
All, including inflammated fighters, love mobile phones, televisions and Turkish opers, which represent modern world and watch overall.
There's an army now.
Are the authorities that will be commanded to be considered sensitive?
Old commanders, leading to antisociety, have already taken measures to restore province communities that would not be subject to central authorities.
Afghanistan, the mountain country, with differentiation, must be to a certain degree where western countries are allocated, but the United States wanted to convert it to a centralized State with a strong presidential authority by eliminating the post of the Prime Minister, which had since the Constitution of 1964.
President Carzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections set out in April 2014.
But his country, starting from the 50s, even before, depends on foreign assistance.
Industrie has not been placed on the feet, no flesh is working, no irrigation system has been reparated.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and fırs.
Priority is given to private initiatives.
In the country disrupted for thirty years of war, the State control over the infrastructure would be.
It was heard that Afghanistan has great mineral riches.
This only strengthened the feeling that western countries were there only to gain them.
Without energy for railroad or medium recycling, without transport means to export them through the mountains, there are no exhausted ones.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the middle of Inak, abandoning the geologs (financed by the World Bank) race to have a great Buddhist complex and to remain the most major robots of the province.
It is also necessary that, on one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, restore standards.
The conclusion of the French fighting divisions was completed on 20 November.
The new Co-operation Treaty provides for the conservation of traditional assistance: persons for girls, boys, French university faculty, French Institute, military cooperation, law, medical and agricultural fields, support for the delegation.
Since 2009, in seeking to " obtain hearts and minds" and to carry out the non-profit task of association with operations, the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was exercised in 2012, together with the small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agricultural farm in tens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive enhancement of the force of the slaves, have been able to help to maintain the resurrectedness: oliveness, drinking water, rebuilding forests, featuring trees, land protection and increased landscape.
What are we going to keep in mind when we spent two billion for military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of the population ' s lives, very severe in these valleys, often higher than 2,000 meters above the sea level.
The staff received tens of writing requests for small agricultural sectors from the communities in the province of Capisa.
To be released from the rebellion, the rue of foreign groups, which farmers want, as they told me, must be a small unarmed support for them that would be well controlled and stressed to them.
Difficulties of the Constitution of Egypt
This is the new risked step of President Muhammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the basis of a constitutional declaration which temporarily gives him exhaust powers, he decided to play a va-bank.
He announced in the middle of all disappointments that the Conference would vote on the text of the day.
A week ago, the head of the State before the assembly of two additional months to end.
Soon, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, sometimes amendments were made, which weaken the institutional stability and enhance the legal opposite.
This new initiative only strengthened the country ' s division.
According to his opposers, the Chairman insists on his "auto-time ship" and continues "injuring this word" and "doing the right".
His followers' camps are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis through transitional process.
Reference should be carried out for fifteen days.
A very short period of time that urges the brothers to refuse to explain Egypt the text of the article.
This is also a way for the President to restore public and democracy, while the deficiency is abusing throughout the country.
Muhammed Morsey, assured that the Egyptians are voting locally as he has declared in one American Week Wednesday Interview to Time.
More than being invited to vote, it comes to the Ultimate of the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, or I remain in my own exciting powers," which, likely, should be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Governing Board, mostly islamists, vote for text yesterday.
Most Liberals did not respond to the call.
In the middle of November, soon before the constitutional declaration, they bought the door, feeling that they were not able to bring their opinion.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to make the concurrence possible, 11 persons of reserve participants were successfully added yesterday morning.
It's very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Not surprisingly, in most cases, the article had been voted on a single basis.
The commentators, in fact, dismissed the fact that one of the few differences of the day had occurred around... the time for prayer, since some members of the Committee considered that the hours of the Conference were wrongly set up.
The text for which the vote was still voted last night consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 finally remained the identical article of the Constitution of 1971, which claims that "the principles of the shariate I are the main source of rights."
The Salafist Party for which the introduction of Islam's right was one of the main requirements hoped to replace " principles" by "regulation" that would give them a more strict application.
For the islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a witness to their good will and respect for others of the Egyptian society.
"Licemia" replies to liberals that only see a piece in it.
Because they believe that the islamisation of the Constitution is being made through other articles.
They specify article 220, which provides an advisory role to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular, in the case of checking the conformity of the laws of chariate.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pomee, this causes anxiety, i.e. "The people who are called to make decisions are not chosen and have no democracy."
We can watch the creation of the theocracy."
Many libraries, besides, are encouraged by the fact that the director of this university seems to be less moderate than the current.
"There is no specific religious involvement.
With this constitution, we remain in the framework of civil rights.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text are not tolerable, but people with university education, some have learned in the French system, "which calms Ale's Bloe, who prepares the diserting for the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits that "the surrounding of article 220 may occur inequality, since the terms used in it are replaced by religious lessons.
This will happen in particular to the "fich" [Islam's jurisprudence, - assume a series].
And in the future, there may be a question of how powerful civil judges are to make decisions about it."
Furthermore, the text adopted yesterday is criticised because it gives the President of the Response large powers.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced in comparison with the old regimes.
Second moment: Army powers.
In the desires of the military, the review of the defence budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
It will also not be prohibited to judge civilians in military courts, despite requests for human rights protection associations.
The latter also expressed peace in the conduct of the text that they consider to be lost for freedom.
Reserved responsibility for divinity is now prohibited for a commitment that may have serious consequences for the freedom of word, especially for the freedom of pressure.
Furthermore, none of the articles speak of women ' s protection, emphasises Heba Moraefe, from Human Wrights Watch.
According to her, at the only time I will be prohibited by torture in article 36.
The word not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak last night on television, the monitoring was planned today in the second half of the day.
The members of the head of the State will, in their turn, go on the street on the Sabbath.
In Israel the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pope of Earth and the Sea of Race
The Promised Earth consists of Bible truths, modern comfort and primary nature.
The "AIF" has determined the five important reasons for staying in Israel.
Should we worship the holy places?
It is worth staying at the river Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is deemed that everyone who enters this “built ” is low by God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the conversion of the wedding of water into wine, the walking through water, the calmness of storm and the filling of networks.
Now there Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of the holy ones in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here are walking in the Travel of Skurve or the Baptist Path of Jesus (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins with the force of Antonia - Pretorium, where the court was, and in the Old City, brings to the temple of the Lord's Grave on the Mount Gogofe - to the Resurrection, the Stone of the Old City, and to Jesus ’ sepulchre.
There is a symbolic Christian Pope of Earth that symbolizes salvation.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be on the place where, according to the Christian end, the tree was grown from which they made a cross for the cross of Jesus.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the wall of the Place, left from the temple that was destroyed by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to the tradition, people of different stories remain here with the wishes that are then fulfilled.
Keep Traveling Vertically
The ruins of Massada's strength remained from a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
They are fixed on the low-scale mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are attracted by alpinism can come to them.
The rest of this historical top will have a lot of coach on the Canadian Road.
And on the north of the country, 1600-2040 m high is a famous coronel of Hermon, on which the winter months are a huge attack of tourists.
To him from the foot of the mountain, the bus-sha's got enough.
The total length of the top traces is 45 km.
According to an elderly tradition, on the top of the mountain, as if the Gentiles lived.
Remember the unique museum
In this country, about 300 museums.
You're not going to be on one ship in all.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, divorced near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Cumran manuscripts, or the mer of the Sea, found in the walls of the Jewish wilderness, and approximately 500 thousand of the geological and anthological experts.
It is worth staying in the Museum of Experience in Tel Aviv.
His exhibitions have been largely presented by the polot of impressors and expressors of Mona, Pissarro, Renuar, Sesanna, Sislea, Mathissa, Modernians, Shagala, Picaso.
Akko can be held in the Al Bash Museum, which represents a number of old Turkish bathrooms with visitors and banks at that time.
In Caesarea, there is a unique part of the Rally Museum, where there can be love for Dal and Roden's sculptures.
There are no scrupules and suvenir lavages.
Income is free, and category not accepted.
The fifth is Holocosta Museum or Jad-Vasham in Tel-Avive - relates one of the most important pages of the history.
The most tragic section is the memory of 1.5 million children's concealers and gas cameras.
You're in it and you're in absolute darkness.
Stars work.
And the names of the Jews and the names of the lands in which they were dead.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
The three main areas of Israel are divided in the Middle-Earth, Red and Mer Sea.
Each of them has bases, aquaparks, delfinary and oceanary.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, even in winter months are buyed, since the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees of warmth, and air grows up to 23 degrees.
The Sea is still the sea, and there are buying a round year.
Moreover, this is the most inhabitable sea in the world is on the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the ocean level.
The lazy water in it is a race that is easily holding on the floor even those who are not able to fly.
Paisages around are incrediblely beautiful.
It is enough to take a course of treatment with the use of salt water, ra, and targets, and to treat health in der, allergies, astms, exemes, arthrites, bronhites, sugar diabetes, so that they can get to a series of harmful nerves.
To touch the secrets of ancient times
The old part of Tel Aviv is the city of Jafo in the Mediterranean.
It was a very famous way of the Sea, which led Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and theropathia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian Ends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark here, and Persei saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived with a happy and happy life.
The tourists love to be stuck on the shoes called Zodiaca's signs.
They're saying if you're looking at the walls of your "sign" street, Fortuna's gonna be kind.
Youths from all Israel and even other countries can be met at the session in Jafo.
And in Caesarea, the town of King Herod, we can stumble through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of crossnotes.
Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontia Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and oper accles.
Tourist on Note
By sending to Israel, do not worry about your uncomfortable English: approximately 30 per cent of people know Russian language in the country.
The money in the driving is better to take not into $2, but in dollars that are easily exchanged on shockles (for now $3.8 to $3.8).
The city transport is primarily the bus, but there is a speed tramway in Jerusalem, and in Haife is the only line of metro in the country, consisting of six grades and the low town with the top.
Actually, it's a underground funiculer.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs six shekels, which can be used for overseas within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition on the Sabbath is a Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunrise on Saturday, markets, stores, public transport are stopped.
And on Sunday on the morning, a slave week begins.
In many coffee, restaurants and hotels, only cosher food, excluding sugar, marine products, fish without cheese, and feed in which milk is combined with meat.
There are a large choice of feeds of barneys and bovines, su and desserts prepared on cocos milk, the traditional Jewish pasture of humus, various susses, the hot nuts of falale, f^tes and fruits.
There are no shiping dogs in the cities of Israel.
So a lot of feeding bottles, which "play themselves out."
On the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the sticks of parking cars.
The murderers love people's places and do not refuse to disappoint.
The car rental, depending on marks, will be $37 on Sunday (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 per day.
And the wheelcypead's going to be at 15 shocks a day.
Museum billets stand in the middle of 30 shekels.
Digital Language
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists worldwide.
Moreover, the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine has been traveling and relaxing.
On the Earth Promised from January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists were spent that 51 per cent of the 2010 analogue indicator, before the 9 February 2011 visa was revoked.
"Great and Power" leads to Moscow: migrants will copy money for language
As deputats and defenses say that the obligation of testing languages will be made, the country has already come to the shipwrappers who trade " lips" certificates
Any year, in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities arrive 13 million gasterbatters.
The majority of the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to carry out money for family maintenance.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force that each employee migrant will be responsible for providing an examination of the Russian knowledge.
Until this rule works only for those who work in the field of service, residence and community, bicycle and different trade.
However, with time, "the MMS promises, tests will be committed to all arrivals.
Moreover, there will be not only language but also Russian history, and the basis of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language should also be confirmed to receive and to extend the authorisation.
Exception is only used for the citizens of the countries where Russian is a public language.
The law and the people who have been able to get ateists and diplomas before the disaster of the SSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Benefit, accusation and protection of rights
The Network of Examining Points will work under the Exhibition of the Russian Language Institute, Puskin, the University of People ' s Friendship, IGU, ABGU and other Russian calls.
The testing of migrants is smoke in all towns; more than 160 such centres are now opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was also supported by the Hosmads deputats and the FMS.
And this is the rightsguardians before the law entered into force, many times have been able to ask: What will this actually be?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for the Russians and for the coming?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service - will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from " hard slavery".
A lot of people now speak about the protection of the rights of migrants, explains the Royal representative of the Russian FMS in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should be started before they are released.
Only the organized set system will allow 90 per cent to solve the problems of foreign slaves.
Problems occur in migrants without training, education, non-known languages, without medical witnessing.
Without understanding the tongue, Sebelev, the future migrant has been determined to go with non-conscious people who would like to help him to put a "travel" into a bitter heavy bar, where he and the tens of like him will have no food and documents for months, and they will have 12-14 hours a week.
We receive a complaint from our migrants.
"Their families are promised one, and they are lying, choosing a passport, not paying the promised payment," confirms the leader of the Master Work Migration Government of Tajikistan Tolib Shariff.
Don't worry, people!
However, while many Middle-Asiatic Republic citizens who are gathered in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country in which they are seeking but also write on their own work.
Of course, it is not so much of their faults: a few tourists, azbeki, a tadjiki can even get such a primary education.
Because their families have nothing to eat children even without saying that they should be dressed, covered and covered in school.
Adult to growth, such guys are sent to age in the first place.
It is hard if it is wrong with the knowledge of the tongue, they are admitted.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
True, the law on the language is noted by the rightguardians on one important moment.
The test will be carried out only for migrants who have a status.
If there is no status, there will be no tests or following official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guestbatters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Foreign Entry Repressed"
Many of the coming people claim that it is not easy to get an official status in our country.
The reason is for bureaucratic suggestions and all the same language difficulties.
Furthermore, the analysis costs money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And this is a false record that can be made quickly and over half thousands.
The Russian police partners know that we have primarily false documents, not registered, from here, and the cases of requirement.
"There are a hundred, two on cigarettes, the tea," divided the journalists of Tajikistan Umed Huschadaams.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only migrant registering documents were false.
A number of "lep" language test certificates have already been issued by the MMS.
Subtitle papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they have received new owners no gift: each of the migrants, hopeing to facilitate the task of testing, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more valuable for the official testing procedure: it will be a job migrant at three thousand.
It is that the main task in the nearby is to protect the system from corruption so that the " shorts" are simply buying, gathering the representatives of the authorities, and the right-guardians.
As long as the authorities can promise the guests that the first time testing has been successful, the time to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, an unknown Russian coming will work in areas that do not assume active communication with people.
VATs are not a illegal weapons market in the trafficking
Country of crimes with the use of the weapons is extremely small
The Russian VAT has made the law on civil weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoot the wedding when there were no victims, and the battle established by Moscow lawyer Dmitrium Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police wish to prohibit the transport of grass in public places and to increase the age of weapon licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea supported the Chapter of the Security and Opposition Committee of Irina Jarova and promised that the amendments to the weapons law would be introduced to Gosdom in the short future.
It is not enough that the Russian authorities are trying to cope with the problem through the "gake-break".
There was an open letter on the Internet, whose authors, representatives of various public shooting organizations, need to be rejected from "insensitive advantage".
The percent of the huliganity with registered weapons is minimum, stated the Bi Bi Bi-si Lawyers of Vasilium Lesnikov.
According to the MVD statistics, 142 crimes were concluded in 2012 with the application of firearm registered in internal matters, while 1168.000 crimes were fixed for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the fullness of the law in civil weapons does not place the criminal to go to the " black" market.
Now, as they say, any weapon can be found at a small price in Moscow.
At the same time, MVD claims that they control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Providers: from staff to officers
The black market is filled with several channels.
The basic five of these channels, the Colonel of Victor Baranek, reports about 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Genstábe.
The box of the site that takes the gun orders
The first is "armean or military track", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the fighting of Kawkas.
"The weapons were thrown by Russian officers, and the cabs themselves," says Baranek.
The next type of black weapons is stolen by criminals in power structure representatives.
The bargain explains that there are also those of the police firms and stolen directly by legal protection authorities.
It's not easy for the sale of the military stocks.
In many military stocks, explosions often occurred.
"There are proved versions that part of the fuel has been made specially - to hide the failure," said the former military.
According to Baranz, they're importing the weapons producers.
"Cause private weapons are currently produced that do not hold competition on the international market and bring weapons out of the field on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of black market is contraband.
It is especially a lot of weapons and automates from poor countries, such as Kirgisistan.
"There is its production, sometimes custful, and a mafia that organized the stream," explains the former warrior.
Where's the weapon?
Experts have considered the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal weapons on the " black" market.
This report was prepared in 2011 for the Center of Analysis and Public-Office Designing.
Experts of analysis have reported MVDs and Rosta, criminal literature and open portals on the arms.
The overwhelming part of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and the forces.
The half of all weapons on the black market about " on the wine of officers whose work is with weapons," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons come from inflammated conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are inflammated by weapons, 5 per cent are " black geology".
The adviser of one of the gun stores, who asks not to call him his family, assures that the weapons found by black gravers have not been buying for a long time.
Often, as he says, the seller's new party is going to a military stock.
Self-contracter buys a unit, such as the TT gun.
It's written before it's been sent by a traveler.
"He's carrying it into the city and selling it here for two stores," he says
"Really, the police in the course of all cases, therefore, periodically when he burns a plan for disclosure of crimes, carrys out control purchases of illegal weapons," adds the adviser.
"What's in the race store?"
The seller and purchases are most often found one another through known ones.
I looked at the sites, in the blogs, until the companion who proposed to come to the form of the Gowai, where there will be a person who will bring me into the angle where we will trade.
The price of the gun I've just learned there.
military obsession: Victor Baranek
In order to get a gun, I need a knowing one who has a department, the sales adviser tells me, I have such a known, but I don't know it.
Sellers on the market are, but there must also come, in terms of Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell the daughters of the teeth.
I'll even get some cassettes through a man who's sure.
He's just putting them too to me, because he knows I'm not going to give it.
News are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranac tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he prepared the article on this.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He gave him a album with graphs, where it was "all right."
"I felt like in a nice store," mentioned the warrior.
The purchaser, according to Baranz, doesn't have a cat in the lake, it's all possible to try.
I, the potential client, don't just buy-- we're going with a seller in the forest, we're putting a shot there.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I assure that the weapon is good, we start trading," described the expert procedure.
Available magazine

It is threatened by long-term stocks by the leadership of these medium-wearing stocks.
According to the official knowledge statistics, in comparison to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in total in Russia was decreased by 7 per cent and was 22.9.000, and the number of facts found in arms and requirements, explosive arts and explosive devices was decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, stafffude and supermarkets are based
On the McDonalds casse, it is going to the fourth of all American growths
In the last days of the United States, the protest action has been made against low wages in Walmart's universities and restaurants of the Pope of fast food networks such as McDonalds, Burger Kings, Tako Bel, Wendis and Kentucky Fried Chiken.
Until no one is able to predict whether this wall will be converted into the nineth wall or is determined to relax at the early steps.
Actions support professionals and a number of left public organizations.
Furthermore, the increase in low salaries receiving Walmart and the quick food systems aimed at creating professional organizations.
Until this economy sector is almost promoted by a professional movement.
46 cents per year?
Actions started last week, after the Day of Thanks, in the "Black Friday", when the orgy of dessert sales had been distorted on America, taking millions of residents and sometimes carrying on the bathroom.
This day, some Walmart corporates, in which 2,2 million people work throughout the world, left their workplaces and pickets together with the professionals and the left activists of the corporation store, whose goods are deemed to be deep and average.
Walmart trades everyone in the world, from the powder, about the roses and car battery to the lease, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores in the average from 8% to 27% of the consumption than in major supermarkets.
Thus, many low-payed Walmart architectures are only on their own.
The availability and assortiment of goods made Walmart one of the largest American corporations.
According to the critics, Walmart can allow itself to sell the goods of a trailer to be part of it because he'll have a little to his own people.
The latter also complained about hard conditions of work, such as lack of carriers or manual scanners.
Participants in the Black Wednesday needed to increase the payment and to see that the value of the medical insurance supplied by the corporation was from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart, who received $9.5 per hour, the cost wasn't on the carm, they spoke.
Scientists at the Californian University in Berkley show that if Walmart increases the average payment up to $12 per hour, it will increase the corporation of $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than it's going to pay for now.
If Walmart totally transfers the increase of the payment on the buyer's shoulders, each visit to the store will be acquired of 46 cents.
For a year, they'll take over $12,39 than now.
Walmart parties are quickly noting that the protest action has occurred only in nine states and have no corporation or smaller damage.
Black Friday continued in her stores from 8 hours of evening on Thursday to midnight, and Walmart sold about 5000 goods per second.
In general, its cash equipment produced nearly 100 million transactions at Black Friday.
The representative of the corporation of Dan Fogelman, at the interview of the left site Huffington Post, stated that the workplaces were left in the general complexity of "minor five" of Walmart, and that the protest action was totally a "specific piar trick" of its promotion.
"Free Cass!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart University (they are not regreted in this progressive city, and therefore they are not yet here), and the McDonalds and other deep restaurants.
Donalds says he's selling a billion pockets, and then he's not even giving you hospitals, and he's not going to be honest!
Jumein Williams, a member of New York's forest
It is currently a minimum payment, which is a federal and New York law, costs $7.25 per hour.
The restaurants of quick food with time increased, but disappointed, and in the middle of them, they receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
Less of them in this road town is no one who wins.
How you can do for such money in New York, it's not possible for me.
Sometimes through the McDonalds, there were almost four American growths that worked behind their adjudications after school and lived with their parents.
A few have seen the main source of research or plan to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm continuing to interview with McDonalds, who regret that they should live on this payment and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, it is a comment that the author notes that it is unresponsibility to carry up children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Participants of the protest action started at 6.30 tomorrow at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Medison Aven, required that the cassers and the breast-feeding system start at at least 15 dollars per hour, which means more than double their current minimum for the hour.
They also needed to create professional organisations in the field of quick food.
The United States Law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish assets of professional movement by awards and releases.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their life.
But to cover a quick food is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main elements is an unusual currency of the frames.
Non-economy
Forest protests were held on that day and in a number of other Manhattan's deep restaurants.
The bulmination of the action appeared in the middle of the minute at McDonalds near Times Square, on which several democratic politicians have spoken, in particular a member of Jumein Williams, who said, "MacDonalds" says he sells a billion portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and will not allow you to be honest!"
The democracy also supported other visible New York democracy, such as the candidate at the post of the city of Bill De Blasio, who claimed that "we should be friendly in support of the fast food farmers in order to achieve the right payment and economic welfare of each New Yorkian!"
As the new York Times was a major action in the history of the American fast food.
However, only a few hundred people were involved in it, while not all of them were a quick company in which tens of thousands were occupied in New York.
Until it's not clear whether this is a mass motion flame.
"Where the brain gets in the middle"
Pope among modern technology worshippers has recently been adopted to take place mainly through the prize of special stakeholders.
The dream was soon at its annual conference, the Google model, and then, in November, the request for the corresponding patent was made to Microsoft.
However, a group of interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft Sharam Isady laboratory of the KBrydge Lab should be a step for the scientists of this point company.
Their manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands, the creation of virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me, in general, what's your research group doing?
- We are engaged in human interaction with cars, but we are trying to move the borders of this interaction.
Until the mass was locked at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes the tickets in their fingerprints.
We want to look forward to 5 to 10 years and predict the change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox plugin and Sensor Kinect is a step forward, and nearly one Xbox today without Kinect is sold, because everyone is interesting in the gesture management.
- What else are we going on?
- Despite Kinect's interaction at a physical level, many of these are happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the result is not much.
We're trying to change this, we're working on actually three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to release the computer world into our physical, making it more accumulable.
For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can add the real world to virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, this stupid shit of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vote management?
Pope's something, but doesn't they revalue it?
- It's definitely called a pancese - a question of privacy, because it does not always want to communicate to the environmental people about their actions and actions.
Actually, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but everyone in his neck.
For example, we had a project to manage the devices in public places in which we were thinking about the gestures, but not on the mixed, but on such a short, short.
In this gesture, not the camera of the device, but the manual brosslet that fixed the mouse of bones and mouse.
Until he's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of hand-times.
But the future is for a mixed type of management, such as the gesture and the voice.
- Is that how?
- For example, how would you ask me to send you this gas bank?
You'll tell you and show you at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want users to adjust to what a car may not be right now?
- It's absolutely impossible, but it's a mutual closer.
I think that in the nearest time, we must mainly work on a new type of sensors that will enable us to determine the human reactions more accurately.
These may be, for example, laser sensors, they give deep depth, it's very important.
- If you talk about your Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your accusations for modern cameras?
Does not enough permissions, depths or anything else?
In principle, the present generation is what we can deal with in our three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 with a speed of 1000 k/s.
But the case is not in the megapixels themselves, but as matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to the designers of algorithms.
So we need to remember not only the allowance on the X and Y axis, but also the Z.
It's also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are manifestly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betiches from our Redmond Laboratorium made a sensor of cashan with a regular delay - from 1 to 100 ms, while modern series sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
They do not all understand how this affects the interaction of humans and cars.
I'd like to have an equivalent of this device in my life, but not a need for cashans to make the images a second more.
- How many cameras do you need to increase?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrastructure, and the second is the recipient of a rejected signal.
And this is the third camera, actually, is the normal sensor of the visible area.
It is not applicable to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or to decrease it by increased the required amount of accounts.
It would be nice to create an enormous kinect analogue, play with a rough camera resolution and see how this will help in the three-dimensional definition of the location.
- As I remember, Microsoft, despite Google, didn't present his eyes.
You don't think that, from the view of all-day use of the technology of additional point reality, it is one of the most perpetuous forms?
- Of course, all the time to rush, holding the smartphone in his hands is not very convenient, but this is what I think that the most crucial option would be the "overcoming" additional reality when you could be able to turn from the smartphone eyes, the projection display and everywhere.
Points are a very personal device, in which their power (private things you see only) and at the same time the additional reality on the basis of the eyes will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with others.
- Imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual golographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to the simple.
There is a problem on which the critics of such idea often indicate: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this call?
- In my lessons, I often say that the additional reality is the seventh account of interactions between humans and cars.
I think the eightth can be an addition of taktic feelings.
Until one of the interesting trucks is the use of the second hand as a famous floor for.
She's registering hardships!
But there are also technologies that are actually addressed to these "air-screen" cards, for example, interfereance of several directional ultrasound bullets at a certain point where the finger is, gives a feeling, but until it's very - as if you've got a bullet.
There are also braslets on the wheat that affect the nerve in their fingers - also a ambiguous direction.
- Did you try to lying to the brain?
To make him think he feels like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we're not trying to do that yet.
There is another task that must be done for a long time - to make a person who is physically in the very space, to believe that he and he work in open, almost infinitely and on the concepts of running tracks (including in clubs), moved forms and great layers.
As long as the brain is in the middle, the work is still very much for many years.
This is what he does over the virtual reality of such an attractive to the researcher - a lot of things in absolute initial condition.
Cousin instead of culture is Rosbalt.ru
The "Rosbalt" continues the "Peterburg's avengard" project, dedicated to the citizens who are in front, in the avengard of culture and experience.
In this list, the light workers of Petersburg's Arthur scenes, whose achievements are outside the town, often recognizing that there is no more than one of the Russian.
The new hero of Rosball is the Epath Artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a person who is dressed in all the red thing that occurs in the Russian Museum, which is in the Latvia Garden, and in the modest towels and towers.
Cyril Miller's pictures always collect the toilet of viewers wherever they are not.
Kirill Miller is one of the ruins of Petersburg's philosophy speakers, creators of new mitologists.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of Petersburg's adventure at the end of the 80s, beginning of the 90s.
Moreover, he is a man of the city, who appears to the laughing of the worst man who rises to all the hearts.
Recently, he took a shirt and a peterbourg charmant, as he had a complex role in all his employment, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still going through the city in all red, not in yellow or birrow, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model who's working in kind and image.
The red color in this world is a compromise between the artist, the immagmaker and the society.
Although everything that is almost not serious in the society is caused by agression and excitation of no property.
But my prophecies are intended to begin.
The whole history of my proclaiming actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you realize that he should be an artist?
- On exhibition in D.C. Nevska, where my work was exposed.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the whale of old free neops of artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I'm combining with the artists of the new whale, with the postgason, which led to Pushkin-10, and there was no more whales.
He's putting me into the theater, clothes, and all genes, except words.
And all this was united in your art-clinic, I was important to take a look at the center of the culture of Peterburg, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took a territory at Pushkin-10, and there until there was a repair, I held a ́artist club, a `embalanced club, a house of Peterbourg gods.
Many were born there: NOME, Tequila-Jazz, I remember how Shnura brought up with the "Ucho Van Goga" project.
Shnur and his friends were sing under the faner, and they were in a tremendous trick, among them was the modern composer of Igor Vdovin.
When the group played alive, she became Linengrad.
Trahtenberg was a leader of many programmes before the Hali-Galia Times.
We gave them Trahtenberg, and his great career, and the basic education and education we received.
The "D 137", the "Griboedo" club is the art-clinic.
There's our guards and always gone.
I'm a hero of the yesterday century when the culture meaned something.
In 2000, the question was in the press, the premium was "The People of Our City."
In the name of the Year's Guest, I was called, and my culmination ended.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become Pope, but culture and population are divided, but it can be popular but not very cultural.
- I'm working with a famous way.
- Many of my pictures are hiths, and they have a clearly expressed accuracy and intensity.
I'll have a program, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
The clowns are an internal category.
I've been before, now to be like this, it's painful and .
But in the clowns, it's distracted, the tragic is filmed.
I like a gross, I have some gross ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace through the total recycling in order of order.
Now on clothes of meetings, orienting on external mechanism, not on internal person.
And maybe he's got to give his hand and he's got to blow in the rose.
And the disappointment will be discharged by re-covering.
And recently, we saw you in the role of a town charmant.
Who, as I don't, are they.
- Well, maybe commercial experience might be beautiful?
- Commercial experience must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
And it's desintogration of cultures.
Earlier, people fell into the room, they loved one, and they were just one.
Everyone's broken into the microcommunications now, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a table paper to like everyone.
Now you need to think who you'll like.
Now every cultural hero has 100 worshippers.
- And Stass Michael's coming for a few thousand!
- It's a brochure, there's a sex-social field.
And 300 people will not come on cultural ground and 10 thousand will not come, and at the outcome, less than a manager, money, all will be covered.
I have worshippers, the main thing is not to lie to them, not to exhaust the nutrition.
I wrote such pictures in the youth that one collector had them on the wall near Falk and Larion.
I started with a picture that usually ends.
Now they are often aware of understanding.
Culture is spiritual, consumption culture.
There is no consumption culture, it is from another operation.
I am a man of culture yesterday, growing on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing pictures.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what does Peterburg miss?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a understanding: a leader of culture.
But not everyone of them can be a culture.
In the real kings, the kings may have not been very understood in culture, but they realized that the right experts needed to be held.
Here are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they were deceived, because they need higher experts that will correctly implement these experts and give them the way.
Now the cousin's flowing.
The same is Erarta, but they dislike what they honestly say that not all modern experiences we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's Peterburg for you?
- Peterburg is not a center of cultures, in Moscow cultures much more, there is a land.
And on our stones, the experience grows hard.
We need cultural ground, and now we have writers more than readers, it's wrong.
Here's a lot of interesting people who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer tone.
We need to make a modest experience as it was at the beginning of the past century.
Project for the Grant of Saint-Peterburg
Birth in the space
The earth is in danger.
Global heating or matching asteroid murder.
Roaded space vessels with landscapes on the board are sent to the search for a reserve planet.
In order to maintain employment, is the main question of how to continue its kind under the conditions of ignorance or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is little.
Actually, only two planets can be obtained at least hypoteticly.
"This is Venera and Mars," it considers the higher Scientific Astronomy of the State Institute P.K. Sternberg (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions are more appropriate for life on Mars, the temperature of Venera is 500 degrees at the surface.
Only living on a big height or on the Venera orbit... in the space.
Approximately to reproduction in the space began with the floor.
A half of the years ago, experiments were conducted.
Four generations of the mountains were not different from their earthquake.
Thereafter the outcome of small, small fruit-drosophils in the orbite.
In 1979, the eggs were sent to the space to check the development of the brion under the conditions of ignorance.
We get an absolutely normal bird outside.
And that's what the problem's going on.
"The problem that the bird has to find opposition must rise on his feet and start moving," explains the laboratory of the Medical and Biological Problems Institute RNA Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding opposition, the birds were unrespected.
And after 10 hours, the newborn was a full atrophy of instincts.
The birds don't respond to the world and sound.
And the trouble was that they just died in four weeks.
"And twice we threw the birds, then we refused because it wasn't easy to work with them," it states the fall of the experiment with the birds in the Vladimir Sychev space.
With animals, the last time the biological "minus" was flying to the orbit 16 years ago.
In 2013, experiments continue.
However, the Bion's bioshop will only be a single person.
There was an experiment with cruses that had already been sent into the space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing overnatural.
"This was just on the bioshops, but again it is a unique experiment, and such studies must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing in the space cross, the seed appeared.
But to reach the problem of multiplication directly in the space until it gets.
It's an uncomfortable job.
Life, losing, normal residence environment, can simply not make their sexual instinct.
But a man, despite the beasts, in principle, may.
Homo ́ens has abstract thoughts and is able to create a similar emotional background.
Ethically, such experiments are not conducted.
But women in the space are 50 years old.
The biggest risk was in Teresca.
And the most precious thing there is a woman's body.
Our Chuck's flight, and no one on Earth could say if he'd be kept in the space after the flight.
Should she be born a child after this flight?
"Behold, no one answered this question," says the Veteran of Raketo-Cosm growth of Vachtang Vachade.
In June 1964, only a year after the airplane to the space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valenne -- Tereskov was born a daughter.
The father of the child Andrew Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut of Sweetlan Savic, who was born two times in the orbit and even in the open space, was born a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, the units are counted on cosmonaves who have all overflowed after the long-term flights, and have a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," it undermines the result of the aeroplane-cosmonaut, the Heroy of the Council Union, the Heroy of Russian Valery Polaks.
However, it is necessary to seek some new ways in biotechnology, protection against radiation, creation of experimental gravity.
The CPC hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage for the preparation for the plane.
In the case of the nul floor, cosmonates are working scientists in the open space.
Water imitates ignorance.
If water, push, and comfortable for adults, but still a strange environment, for breast-feeding children is a natural nature.
Little yotiands as if they confirm that life on dry is out of the ocean.
There is a relationship between the young man who has been in a thickness of nine months in his mother's weight, and it is more habitual to the water.
In principle, it's logical because since birthday, since the first buying, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says Marina Axenova's tissue.
In words, if invisibleness is more natural than a child born, women are gravity, difficulty.
The mouse of life is very quick in the invisibleness, and the taza is able to exhibit fruit.
All right, let's lose it, trusting the stimulators of family activities.
It may, of course, go to a special camera, she'll take it out.
"What else?", says the neutrality of the issues of Valery Polaks.
On the other hand, the child also needs experienced gravity.
Without a sense of earthly attitude, the body does not form a scell and muscle system.
It is not like adult to be clothed in a special carrier costume for training.
He will just be missing what he needs to live.
"And this experiment that we will go with you by allowing the child to be born in the foreign environment will lead to bringing a person's invalidity to the Earth of a completely disadaptated man," says the runner of the IMBP RAN Igory Pestaw Bioetics Committee.
Until the birth of children in the space is the question of the theory.
However, after time, it will be reality when landing on their ships will be moved to a planet that will become a home for their offspring born in the space.
Chief of the Major Control and Revision Management: The control of the system has fallen on political wine.
The Czech Republic's growth has good control bodies and, despite a quality law, remains in use.
This is the statement of Miroslav Cala, Vice-President of the Control-Revision Management, from an interview for the site Currently.cz.
"The Law will never be ideal, but it must apply correctly what I think we have not enough," is the comment of Kal's current situation.
The successful conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of a wrong proverb, Peter's approach to the so-called Swartz system brings Netimes.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GDP (Gradian Democratic Party) would not be concerned about checking undertakers - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The Law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister may not oppose the institutions that are involved in checking and fulfilling the obligations," Cala states.
At the meeting of the Revision Committee at the Deputats Palace, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and the German parties in which the law on the public purchases of both countries was compared.
What exactly happened?
There's a parallel check that we've started, probably two years ago.
Increasingly, the statement that the Peace Law confirms how public purchases should be carried out, the national law should be fully applied and then applied.
All information was collected and, even in an unfinished verification, were found interesting differences - simplerly, we have the law may be " exact and injurious," but we are entitled to Germany on some parameters.
It is therefore necessary to focus on the application of the law that it is inadequate to create more and more precise rules.
And how can this project help you what it means for you?
Exactly such joint controls may contribute to the efforts to remain accurate, reduction and compatibility of laws, as it does not result in a positive result.
Economy means obtaining the relevant (but not always low) price in order to avoid riches and perhaps crime behavior.
But not the fact that we do this by decreasing orders.
This system may be filled with "bumagays" so that those who want to find the lazees in this system will find them much more than if the decrease had not been decreased.
You are talking about the internal issues of the application of the State acquisition law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Does there be such a existence as our CRU (Contrôle-Revision Management) or it works differently?
As a result of the institutions, there is the Bundesshof, which is established by our principle, also a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions are working similarly.
Furthermore, the powers to a certain degree are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audience and at the level of federal lands, their system is different from our.
BRH can only be managed by federal money, we are available by public funds.
Common funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting palats.
What is the case of the law of the law, there is easier than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some cases Germany can be taken as a pattern, but it is certain that it is better in everything.
That's because they're better controlled?
No, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the model countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?
If you are talking about the internal law, how did the amendment to the State acquisition law reflect on your institution?
Since the legal power of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been shown in our control works.
Since we are controlling the fact, we need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the preparation of future checks - we have started using our new instrument "detecting the risk of non-economicity" through which we have lost almost 14000 State contracts, and we have analysed them, and, of course, these changes will be shown, because changes are changed, changed the conditions of some types of tenderers and so far.
How do you think that this law will benefit or further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law, of course, has passed in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules "will be worryed" and will not be able to follow them.
In the operation of previous rules, controlled undertakings are related to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the Regional Board) that any failure to the State acquisition law means a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Does the law in such a way need to be fulfilled?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who want to catch and misuse, but do not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
This system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And how can you get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this way will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GDP would not worry about the controllers of the so-called Swartz system.
"Swartz-system" prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way, and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister may also not oppose the institutions to be able to check and fulfil the obligations.
"We're changing this law and allowing it," but we'll say that we're going to be as if nothing happens.
The law on public purchases contains sufficiently strict rules as it should be implemented formally, and it is right, which will protect public purchases.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is discalificed only because of the deficiency.
The Law will never be perfect, but it must apply correctly, which I think we don't have enough.
The roads are rocky but mainly passed.
In some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are deteriorated and deteriorated.
They are mainly running, but somewhere more carefully.

Regional road slaves warn the leaders of honey, which may be particularly trained at the highests of the Pardubian country.
Gooled can be around Lanschroun, Usti-nad-Orlici, Polycy, Switavi or High-Myto, especially on the roads of the second and third class.
Paths I/43 and I/34, resolved in Switwa, related to chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of Crkonoshe and the Orlic Mountains.

Simon Ornest: On concerts we want to buy energy
What do you think that less than a month has to have the end of the light?
It's just one of the many anxiety news that we, people, are so easy to believe.
Instead, with the The Tap Tap group, we are continually aware of this and we say that we are the only group in the world that can collect sufficient energy to delay or prevent the end of the light.
Moreover, in December you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to tell the readers more about this?
The general activities on the collection of funds we have planned for two years.
We decided to use the market potential of the May calendar, which was announced on 21 December 11:10.
For the day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and the island will be started parallelly.
They will finish, and they will say, at the time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, where the magic calendar is finished for 12 hours before us.
Who did this idea come to?
It was my idea that we all had been thinking together with our art of Gonz August.
Although we want to capture enough energy and prevent the end of the light, we also want to think together with the public about the situation of this world once to transmit to our own.
In the case of the master calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from cows, footballs, baskets and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and the same support.
The Tap Tap Group, together with other agents, also fulfilled a limb against the end of the light, called " The End of the Light is canceled."
Does YouTube's already loved listeners have a himn on these profitable concerts?
Of course, at the end of all things, the end of the world will not end.
All artists will take it on all concerts at the same time.
At the same time, the circles are also in the direct area of the Czech TV.
The words of this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the Tomash Ganak film, participating in the fulfillment of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life because we conduct many good works and concerts.
We are trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It seemed that many like to work with us, they're interesting.
What do you eat from the concert against the end of the light?
In order to purchase equipment for the Free Education Centre of STUDEO, we have been working in this way in the sixth year with the Tap civil unit at the Edlik Institute.
Regual teachers visit students of the Institute Edly School and conduct fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves have no means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
In the context of the draft additional building of the Institute of Ediky in the future, we will be able to go over with this project.
There will be several groups and artists on each concert.
What were the criteria of the election?
We tried to set up a programme that involves all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irgi Suhi will be expressed.
All details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "ground business" in the future?
In May, we will first speak on the "Pratic Weight" Festival and we will, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would be pleased to present a presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
You have severe plans for the border, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with adequate opportunities.
How are you doing with the way from the view of organization and logistics?
It's not like the first look.
We have five participants in the electrical non-value boxes, their knifes have to travel in the baggage, plus all the large number of wages and instrument boxes.
The Czech Airways and British British Airways were always greatly prepared for us for how many times I was.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, everything went out without a problem.
Thanks to the outcome, you can compare various countries from the view of accessibility, publicity to persons and so far.
What did you do to this moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we have, we became witnesses in Russia that there is still a base level on east.
In comparison with Prague in Moscow, many bariers are still in the wildlife, and there is still a self-moving man to the electricity of a non-valid coat in the centre of the city.
There are also no bans that can't be able to walk in the way of the invalidity in the lift.
Fortunately, there are public organizations who are attempting to focus people on the problems of people with opportunities.
In contrast, what should we continue to take forward countries?
There's a lot of things, the level of fulfillment which is far behind.
However, it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those who are in charge.
In London and Madrid, it's totally normal that people with a hard form of invalidity can move themselves to the halls, to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
It is not very distributed that a large number of people who have the opportunities are actively involved in the public life, in that we and the Tap Tap are a little warning!
Respect of publicity or security is one thing, but at the moment when sports, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers are present among us, all will be really changed.
Until this is a unique event, people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but will we return to two years ago that in 1998 you would have organized it?
I went to the Edly Institute as a teacher, around me there were many young people who wanted to do something.
And since I'm playing myself and playing on saxon, I've organized a interesting circle with my colleague.
Well, with time, as our leader Lady Angelovich says, this was a little out of control.
The Pope's coming only in the last years, or I'm going to do something?
That is true, we have been helped by the beginning to join a number of songs and actively working on the promoting group.
We concluded that the work that no one can evaluate is as if it does not exist.
With the means of the Union, we can allow qualified teachers, equipment and so far.
Did the goal be so good for you to broke the Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in ability to do something inevitably.
In Shaw-Bise, it's a whole thing that imitates one another.
It's logical, all new things are accepted with caution, and it's too long.
There's a very little rare thing, but I'm sorry to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, lamentation, is naturally...
But this lamentation is perfectly too much because people with the opportunities are not meant to any suffering and dismissed persons that we have to complain.
They are people who can live a full-valuable life and develop, of course, only when they are acquired of resources.
I say, if there's something that happens to people with invalidity, it's moved not only for them, but also for all society.
Has it been successful that you are a strike rue, which many believe you?
If we want to do qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromissive and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
People come to us with romantic representation and years in clouds, and when they find out that they have to go on repetitions twice a week, visit the prepared courses and spending a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and reach something.
The Tap Tap group is now twenty people.
How many of them were beginning in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's not worth preventing.
For those who have the desire and the power of the will, our doors are always open.
It will stand for the day before the expected end of the light on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
Concert pros in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - in the Fléda and Islands Club - in the center of Plynojem with participation to 12 groups and other Czech groups.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are united by telemount at the time of the playing of the group The Tap Tap " The End of Light is canceled."
The objective of this project is to collect a financial amount of 25 million crons to buy a multifunctional free equipment for the STUDEO Educational Centre at the Eleckey Institute in Prague.
Concert billet is 400 crons, for children up to 12 years, free income. Bohemiaticket can be purchased before.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the Agency of Poland, it was adopted by the twenty-second member of the Agency ' s Agency ' s headquarters as the second country of the former east block (after the Czech Republic, who became an integral member of the ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and took active participation in several Agency projects during the following years.
But the way to the Space has started a lot before.
Before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were running to the space, but it was not always in mind.
For example, on the lection of A. Sternfeld, which represented in Varsovia astronomy in 6 December 1933 the observatory of idea from its innovative work " Introduction into Cosmonauticum".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left an equivalent audience, and after a few years, Starnfeld reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in it.
In 1934, Shernfeld won the premium of Robert Esso Peltry and Andreas Louis Hirsh for "Introduction into Cosmonautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), of which was mentioned above, later a large propaganda of astronomy and cosmonavigation.
He repeated hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
The Hadomian world propaganda of the cosmonautian, and its contribution was evaluated, including that one of the raters on the opposite side of the Moon was called to be honored.
In 1925, Poland was built a race-based racket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
Not even clearly, the racket should have been used for the dilution or packing of the lamp.
The inhibitation of this dress is only from the press of that time.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about racket arrows.
The investigation was conducted by the Section of Infrastructure Technology in collaboration with Professors McChislav Wolfka and Gustav Moskvic.
Manufacturing materials show that studies have reached the stage of practical trials.
But when German armies arrived, they were interrupted.
In 1937, a specialized print was the idea of the electr of the destruction racket offered by the Rogozinski engineer, and in the year the work of the Lelivy-Kivoblock's author was carried out.
Both projects were set up for military use of racket engines.
Before the war, all drafts of the military use of racket technology were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (The Temporary Committee of Doradczo-Science), which was coordinated by the whole.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity, the work was completed due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to the cosmonautic, has occurred in the Polish press after war through the Polish Astronautic Society (Poland Astronautic Society).
The first of the public is mentioned in the November 1954 magazine The Progress, in which four volume articles on astronautics are discussed.
In one of these Professors, Mr. Sobotovich proposed to organize a society that would be able to be cosmonatic.
At that time, drafts of experimental satellite projects had already been introduced, and it was clear that space research was a perpetuative growth.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter into the international astronautical federal (based in 1951) and has already become its member.
And in the year 1959, the first chairman of the POA Kazimej Zarankevič, by the Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He remained at this place until he died in 1959.
Since 1956, the OA has contributed to the development of a completely successful RM meteorological racket (Raketa Meteorologicczna), which has become the first Polish racket conducted scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first start was held on 10 October 1958.
The racket that was able to overcome the race of 1800 m was about 80 cm and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Thereafter, a improved version of RM-1A was built, and in 1959, a double-degree RM-2 racket was tested in the Bledow desert.
The racket was about 1.4 m and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
The next version of the racket was already able to take the current scientist - the RM-34 racket could exceed 14,5 km and was monitored by the high wind.
But the further development was stopped in 1962.
The inheritance of the first RM rackets was meteor-1, once between 1962 and 1965.
The racket was designed as a two-degree, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (such as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1S) were different from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The meteor-1A was available with a space of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l and Meteor-1S - 0.62l.
All three types of flight distance were 37 km.
During the period between 1965 and 1968 at the Aviation Institute, the racket of Meteor-2 was held, and its first annual tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 racket with a start weight of 380 kg was able to extract a weight of 10 kg at approximately 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also necessary to focus on the introduction of Poland into KO_AR (The Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the KO_AR National Committee for two years later.
Furthermore, in the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in the research of the space space on the Soviet research satellites, and in 1978 the Polish Pilot Miroslav Hermashevski second intercosmonab after Vladimir Remeck.
The abrogation of the law on public work is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court canceled the law on public works.
The establishment has caused a survived debate in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at this issue with a wider view.
Free-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are in principle of unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that economic divisions, national economic systems, are in constant conflict.
This is with the principle of free trade and free movement of the private capital, together with an unintentional financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of slave forces (for ́a ́tay ́a ́a ́tay ́a ́tay ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ́s ' ́s ́s ́s ́s ' ́s ' ́s ́ ́s ́s ́s ́s ́n ́n ́s ́s ́s ' ́s ' ́s ́
In this sense, it is necessary to understand when the manufacturer is trying to remain in the economic competition through the fact that the value of the competitor is "flow" in order to take a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
In the mass, this means the majority of enterprises or the transfer of roof production, or destruction, and results in increases in the countries where the value of the slaves is high, compared to others.
Since the private capital does not take any responsibility, including for their ownership, the inevitable expenditure of the State for the needs.
In general, the situation enhances the lady of enterprises to make taxes and thus compensate the public economic and economic damage which they have to be carried out after the acquisition.
The situation is so well that specific statistical data are not required.
The unsearchable methods of private capital are the economy of a separate state in which the Governments of the countries have to enter into competition in order to experiencing the level of their population with a view to entering the country of foreign capital.
In other words, governments give their own population to a private capital, despite a disaster.
This reflects, in particular, in the changes in the legislation of nature.
The objective is to encourage their people to submit to the dictate of private capital, especially in the field of private capital.
This works as a system of economic force in the case of long-term and is at the same time a tool for breaking the rights of the employee in the field of labour law.
As a result , the level of poverty increases and the difference between the poor and the rich .
There is a public distribution of products to poor who are not able to feed themselves with their own work for several years.
The number of these people are already approaching a million.
In the context of the increased competition of the German economy, there are continually events when employed people receive such payment that the State should pay them to receive a minimum of residence.
The good scandal is public and in the case of additional Buddhists.
The economic measures of the EU are, of course, to the same situation in which people who are under the pressure of a disaster of the status have to be obliged or emigrated, as it was in the 19th century, or to pay neighbourhood payment in the company's areas in hope that sometimes in the country with a private investment capital.
But he asks where he will take it from?
If capital from other EU countries, poverty is moved from one country to another, or it is not in the case of Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Marokkanian, Egyptian, African still works for the part of Peece.
It's caught to the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media of mass information to warmty claims that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own household that the economy managed is to the economic disaster.
The partial capital insists that the State should not be involved in the economy by administrative actions.
The question should be answered, is it not a private capital, which now is practically governing the policy, and is the most common State, for its own selfish purposes?
The only answer is yes.
The evidence is the employment of almighty and all-scale lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an unusual situation shown in corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the law where almost all are deserving punishment, but it is not a crime.
The situation in the FGF is that the State ministers are in the absence of financial funds near the absence of law projects to private legal firms, which are crucial with industry.
These legislative drafts are then approved by the Bundestag.
The whole authority is not from the people as the constitution of the Western type, but from the financial-power groups prefering their own interests.
It is evident that the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly in the situation described by Appian in the production of the Roman Empire Crisis in the days of César and Pompeia: "The State has been deteriorated for a long time, and the sciences are committed by violence.
Consumptions, illegal receipt of ships with stones and wounds.
The hostility and corruption flowed without prohibition, and the people went on elections with a previously sold voice"......the people were not balanced on the position of the Governor, at the end, the State remained for eight months without consule.". "The very beginning to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is self-reservation and need for the choice of a man of energy.". Appean: that it would be Pompey, but they were César who had kept changed the democracy to self-keeping.
Like in ancient times, it has overcome its own unfair interests in the present society without taking account of public interests.
The private capital is no longer intended to apply for public purposes.
The current result is not different from the past: the inconsistent fall of the elite without any effort to reform the deeper character.
So the cause of fascist and communist regimes is to be searched for unfair liberalization of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
The lack of these regimes and the democracy of the liberal type can be considered as a certain pause after which the tours are expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite is fully ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and humanitarian disasters, which we already observe, as we know from the old and new history.
The abrogation of the law on public work is not a decision or at least not forever.
The Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further decrease the population.
Thus, this trend has a systemic character.
I am determined to take the objectives of political and employment reforms to strengthen the right participation of the State in the economy, to strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and to weak the monopolary situation of the private capital in the public for the benefit of the State.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratorium.
"Out of violence, and never can come out," "Sting, the song "Groupies", where the main verse I'm referring is saying, "We're not forgetting what we are."
"If my sons wouldn't want wars, they wouldn't be," was the dead Gutel Snaper, Mary Amshel Rotsheld's wife.
After the wall of violence between Israel and the Gaza sector, as always, she was answering.
One expression for Israel, arguing his position by the right to self-defence, and the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing this by the racist of Israeli State, genocide composed of Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is assigned to the terrorists of the State.
I don't want to think of who in these periodically repeated murder whales is a criminal and who, finally, the victim of Israel's citizens, including self-governmental territory, were born at the present political situation and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer the readers to look forward to the intentions of looking forward to those who have served at first 95 years of pressure (without the signature of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) to the small part of the Middle East country.
My considerations are supported by historical facts, some of them are understood by my own understanding of who or what group of people are the main engineer of modern history.
The history of the unity is primarily the history of the fight against authority.
At every time we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
It is not so clear that these people have always taken their steps completely, or someone who has sent their actions on their throne to the purposes of the previously intended purposes.
It should be permitted that we live during the period when the world ' s riches are ended in the hands of several persons, and that the money and the powers of them could not occur for a generation's life.
One of the astronomically rich families is assigned that could be considered as a snap (I don't know if someone is worth them, but it doesn't be excluded) is Rotshild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first News Agency (Rathers) had already been bought in the 19th century to stop the audiences associating their name with criminal action in the higher areas in which they had been, and always leading to strengthening their power, accuracy of riches or at the same time, and to the other.
They have major packages of action almost in all central banks of the world, and against countries in which central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or prepare war (only seven countries were taken to Afghanistan, after the entrance of Iraq, 5 countries remained only four, but the Russian Government took the central bank of its country in their hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the central bank at the Rothsildov Bank of America, during the civil war, he started to release his own (regional) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy started to release his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the Federal Reserve System) was killed in 1963. The Deputy Louisfadden was devoted in 1936 after he wanted to judge the FED for the resolve of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desires of the world power have led to a plan of three world wars created by the large mass of the 33th level of Albert Picom.
The first war was the distortion of the monotic states in the second, the second had to have to have a gentleman, especially the United Kingdom, and the third must lead to a decrease of the world ' s population at approximately 0.5-1 billion people (so the number of slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and growth and they will not need much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing other than a proposal for that project) and the absolute authority.
The method in which a group of the richest families in the head of Rothsilda works is the challenge of the crisis and the next proposal of decisions (order ab chao - a chaos order).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED, which had to prevent the repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they had been able to solve the First World War through the murder of the Austrian Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they held the Royal Russia, beginning with a majorist revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unbased in the military and economic context of Germany (not yet needed for war for the Kingdom of Russia) and, as a consequence, the deterioration of the Central Eve State, Austria and Hungary.
In order to facilitate the dissolving of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a hidden situation by putting great military reparations on Germany as the preference to radicalize the mass of the diluents, then it was only to put the Germans a quite strong, guilty and simple decision of the Governor, to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to play, and actually played the function of the fifth part, in the burning of the war ' s fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothsilda promoted the Sionist movement, one of which tried to create a Jewish State, willingly in the history of Judah with Jerusalem as his capital (return to Zion).
The above-declaration of Balfure created a preference for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, which began the first meetings with the Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War, difficult to evaluate whether Hitler was exhausted from the staff in which the bankiers had originally held it, or everything he had done, was planned, in any case the suffering of Jews in the camps of the Jewish worldwide had created advice to recognize the Jewish State by the world.
Israel was official in 1948 and, as Germany was conducted by military reforms for the second world war, the State of Israel was announced to establish a third war.
If the banks are able to join it, the Jewish nation, as in the second world war, will become a victim of fighting on the front line, now with the Arabic or, easily, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of distortion and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to take only a rare division of people on strangers and opponents of Israel).
Who are guilty, and who are victims of the Palestinian conflict, where distress leads to injury in an infinite sequence of violence, if all started from the desire of individuals and their desire to the world power?
It is necessary to distinguish Israel's ordinary people from their leaders because, as we have, bankiers agree with people to vote on elections exclusively to their own candidates.
The present Prime Minister of Israel of Natanyah is a typical example of the fascist, loyal bankiers in order to start war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to cross into the world conflict and will take into account the control of Iran on the Ormish oil that contains 20 per cent of all global oil stocks (the court is only 2 miles (WHO)) - will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are now shown by David Rockfielder in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of lords and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the population serves to a ugly financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
The world where each body born is implanted in the birth of a chip with which it becomes an integral control.
"And makes all the small and large and poor and poor, free and slaves have on the right hand, or on the loaf, so that a man who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name could not buy nor sell.
This is what wisdom is: everyone who has a beast can calculate the number of animals.
For it corresponds to the name of Hezekiah, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
Film "Argo Operation": When worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a multitude of islamists-demonstrated students took the United States mission in Teheran and took 52 diplomas in the carriers.
They should have been released to exchange the north of the Mohammed Reza Pehlevi Shak, who had come after the revolution in the United States, who had been the coverer of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. Administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not supposed that it could not allow herself to throw a shock out of the board because it could have dismissed the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not able to achieve the freedom of the prisoners in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was an attack on the United States' prestigiation, which later was strengthened by an insufficient attempt to free the hosts by force.
The arrested diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations in the middle of the Government of Algeria.
Their sentence was called for the house of solidarity and anti-terranean arrangements.
The damage in Iran has contributed significantly to the damage of Jimmy Carter on the presidential elections of 1980, completed the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, aggressed by Ben Aflet, "Argo Operation" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought the American small victory.
Soon before the occupation of the employee, six persons were able to be able.
After difficult periods, they ended their way to reside in Canada's posterity.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, has been able to take them out of Iran, and has helped an extravagant coverage end that they have passed in Canada as members of the same group seeking a place in the country for science-epope.
Genres summary
The plan that made a "evacuation expert" to Tony Mendes required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be reliable, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, the press conferences were established, and the productive company had a real office.
Detailed operations have been held in secret, movie, on Tony Mendes' memories.
The Affleca film is a combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political triller, such as "film-kinoos", the story of successful deception, the matters may be a number of films about Oushen's friends.
The film continues to change the opinions - on the one hand, documentally behind the scenes of Teheran (in the titres shown signic history records of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no great differences in it).
On the other hand, Hollywood rubbers are facilitated, crossing ironia and moderate overcome.
And then more scenes from the CIA apartment and other agencies -- men in the costume discussing the situation at the negotiations tables, at the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Benu Afleku has been marvelous to make a career restaurant.
From a ridiculous actor, the register is considered, and his game has stopped to be an object of smile.
"Argo Operation" is its third full-metered movie, after the dark child's "Peace, child, forgive" (2007) and "Groad" triller (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Afleka, which is not filmed in the home town of the register Boston.
The atmospheric atmosphere, however, will take place with qualities that have increased the early recorder films above the Hollywood standard.
And Appleck shows it in Argo, where Tegeran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the movie are at y, in the river of the real events -- enter the scenes of the public fall are impressed by their clearness, which also translates emotions of opposition and unpredictiveness that occur when the story is suddenly changed.
Appleck and his colleagues seemed to have reached in the scenes of the inventor (tegeran based station).
Too many processes in too many places.
The register had to be concerned that the report was not supposed to have a film-scanner of significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes something finds out - it's not so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the emergency crisis in the Tegeran airport, and the aircraft's cargo looks quite conscious).
The lack of " Argo" is the divergence that is needed to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are truly fair, but their persons would deserve more space, and they are not only one in the movie.
The Affleca film is not enough for a little draism, it is a movie that can be viewed with a moderate interest, with the establishment and the retro-style that rebuilds the seventy trilers.
But it's working.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in the meaning of the life story, and to testify over the extent of the presentations of the Almighty and All-known Speech Services.
Rules of air chains, bananas and circles
The portal of www.bankovnipoplatky.com, each year in question of the most absurd bank collections, now decided to announce a concurrence on "some absurd settlement or project from the EU master".
"We have underlined this last event in which the EU plans to accept a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major Peeker companies," said the Prosecutor Patrick Nager.
A recent decision of the Court of Justice for the Joint Insurance Tax for Men and Women is among those already issued.
Before these couples, women had money for life insurance because they were objectively undergoing less risks for insurance companies.
"The following incredible ideas from the EU Master can move people to competition until the end of this year.
Only the vote will pass until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The EU shall, for example, be binding to add biocomponents to fuel, which results in nature, and prohibit the use of reliable grape grapes only because they contain a substantially small number of dangerous materials, or the Directive on the size of the steel cell, which resulted in the eggs in this year .
The criticism has also been a real prohibition of the use of the term "butterboat oil" or the exemption from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimetres long.
The Community's equipment often makes a decision under the pressure of that or other trade or industrial lobby, which normally protects the positions of any State or group of States in Brussels (that is, Czech now, even under a threat to the demands of its banks).
The lobby interactions are such: for example, the higher quality bananas in the Rose Union had to reach the length of 14 cm and were not able to show "anonymous science".
In this regard, the Commission justified that only harmonising different national rules which have complicated trade.
The EU, despite the opposite of some states, has not yet mixed the standards of cashing fibres and fruits, with regard to the use of products.
The candidate for winning in question may also be the EU's annual establishment last year, whereas the sales of aircraft should be obliged to be warned that children are less than eight years of age not to be able to delay them without monitoring adults.
The EU focused on American studies in which the aircrafts in the game are the potential cause of children's death through the wound.
The advantage is now distributed to children up to 14 years of age, which has been prohibited to swallow in the jail.
Awesome ideas are born and home
The rule of the most absurdity is also a rule that affects the same factors: everyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, taking into account the delicateness of the topic for Greece, use the name of the Cedone, but should instead say "BURM" (ex Yugoslavia Republic).
The Banko ́poplatky.com Portal, in collaboration with the "Princep Infinity" liberal economys (Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of trade stocks in the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of the food stocks that may be located in the Czech Republic's territory on the day of its entry into a rose union.
Consequently, the Czech Republic has increased, for example, the amounts of conservated grapes, which threatened a big trap.
The applicant's organizations also interested the idea to some countries because they had no sea, and the idea of subsidy supplies to the application of subsidy.
But these ideas appeared in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in an inappropriate position because we have no sea.
We will ask the Union for compensation," stated the Minister for Agriculture of Jaroslav Palas on August 2004.
As a argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain grain in the country, and the State had full stocks to be exported from such intervention purchases.
Because Czech is far away from the ports, the EU, the Palass, had to pay us hundreds of millions.
Finally, the Commission visited the Czech Republic by organizing a tender to purchase grain from countries that have no outcome to the sea.
The subsidies for the receipt of subsidy offered the Regional Development Ministry to the villages of Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidys had to go to the establishment of a subsidy statement from Brussels.
EU: Amazing provisions are excluded
Although the establishment in Member States is easily critical, the EU's efforts to regulate and to improve the functioning and development of the Russian union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
The serious problem, as the experts believe, is to draw up EU contributions to projects that do not even intend to do something generally with the deep integration of Peace, but which the Member States have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
It calls on emotions among the cheques and that, as in other countries, the Czech Republic must be held in Brussels for the right to a specific identity of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this arrangement.
Although after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, the name "Olomouckeys", but the "Thuzemian ROM" traditions in our country were roots in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed to "Thuzemak".
It can be called romans only products from a distillate, not from a sugar swimming.
In the official list of EU-registered products, as well as the worldwide "feta" and "horgondzola", marcipan from German Loveck or Parmish, have already been shown, such as carlovaric sugars, horrible and tershbonic carp and tactic milk.
The EU’s trade mark may also be proud of pardubical tubes and horse tubes.
People want me to talk about the reply, but I'm a lover, Ocamura's approving.
Mr. Senator, how is the man coming to vote to the president's post?
I don't think to be a Senator or a president himself.
If we had all the functions in the country without problems, I wouldn't be stuck anywhere.
But I can't see how the country has been disappointed in the last 20 years, how heavy heats, people have increased taxes and pensionary age.
I hadn't had an abb to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a decision how to change it.
And since I've spent forty years and I'm an independent person who does not have any party, I have no other possibility to influence things except to vote on the post of the Senator or the President.
You're in the Senate, but you're going to the presidential camp.
Do you not turn your back to those who have chosen you?
I always said that I would be involved in fighting for the presidential castle depending on the results of the elections in Senate.
Later, I pointed out that if I'm a Senator, I'll vote to the presidents.
My goal is not a job, it is a tool that I can discuss my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the largest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we are as a nation in the bar or in the television, but we are ready to break a person who's trying to change something.
It is added to the MMSs that decrease humans and who deepen the freedom of words with the freedom of lies.
For example, they told me that I was giving the journalists an advisor or I was Irish Parroubeck.
Let's go to your views.
You have started fighting for the president's lock with those on the material and coherent policy responsibility and on the reverse property declarations above twenty million.
It is necessary to change the law in order to do this.
You have no such powers as the president, and only the whole seat can comply with the laws.
How do you want to resolve this task?
When I am a citizen of lobby to make the exercise of a free undertaking, it has been possible.
The problem is political - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, it is intended to make obstacles, and it is to stop the citizens.
As an independent unpartial person, I have a great potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that I can take the best for each party and apply it without a partial setup on the pupils, without taking into account the doctrines.
Do you think you're a person more related to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I think people have me on the left.
It's not important for me, a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
It's not that someone's going to the right, but someone to the left, I want to join people.
I will always support any good decision for the society, whether the CCP or GDP will propose it, and I will be in the same way against the bad idea.
You're bad when someone says you're popular.
But do you not prove that by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideas of goals and views.
And you are trying to draw closer to that.
It may be called popularism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they are spoken by visual experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you'll have only a lot of lozing.
And you're not going to be in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you come out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out the responsibility of honorable and materially?
I don't have any other chance.
Only convince politicians, journalists and publicity and try to move them to their side so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been chosen by the President, it would not be a problem to organize a primary television transmission in which I would address the presidents of the parliamentary parties with an invitation to legal and honourable responsibility for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to inform why they do not want it.
If there is a strong person that causes misuse, pressure on the political scene can be demonstrated.
Take the presidency of the president's elections -- it was a pressure service from the public.
I'm insisting that I'm a lover, not a genius, and not a intellectual.
I'm trying to look for aliens to keep my convictions and views.
I'm just starting in politics, and I'm trying to support the majority for my programme.
I'm trying to move myself; if it doesn't work, I'll finish and return to the private sector in six years.
It sounds like Ocamura should save the Czech.
I'm not a saver.
I know that I'm not gonna do anything alone, so I've got a lot of people with a proposal to vote in the Senate.
I went to Radio Janchure, he refused to work a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading investigation of the journalist Jan Lawrence, who discovered the brain of fuel oil products.
I've done my candidate because people are really unfaithful, but now I'm feeling weighted.
The sixty per cent of people did not go to elections, but most of those who went to be chosen by the representatives of the graduate.
Only two of us are independent in Senate.
People chose the Senate so that changes would be made to work.
Nevertheless, I will take place for my views, for example for the pressual choices of members and Governors.
Are you thinking about your own party?
I have no time to check the cleanness of every potential partner of the past, and I don't have money for it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparency account only for twenty thousand crons.
You don't have money?
You are talking about proper declarations, and how will your own business be?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have parts in Prague with approximately 25 million, a apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an experience collection of approximately 10 million, Astone-Martin 3.5 million, and Superb's damage per million, and a few million more.
Besides Aston-Martin, I've come out because it was my little boyfriend -- I always liked James Bond, who bought on the car, was a galant with women, and at the same time was against the wound and lack of law.
You're going to Aston Martin, you have 60 million property and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the reply, but your own money doesn't want to contribute to it.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I come in?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors is evident that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to do for a pre-election campaign from my carton.
The expenses of the campaign will actually cover the senatural payment.
But for these money, for example, I wouldn't have been able to keep my son in the English school, which is $30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to buy money, I wouldn't worry anywhere.
So you're going to continue to be undertaken so that you can live?
Didn't you say that you would reduce this activity?
But this doesn't depend on the amount of the payment.
As I promised, I shared my activity.
For example, the Director of the Agency's tourist will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a silverless man who will keep the rep.
But I need to live for something too.
How much, as we're doing, have you used to get every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that's what I get.
And if I was the President, I would have finished my business.
You'll find a full interview on the Sunday issue of the "Right" newspaper.
MVRDV architects demonstrate that actual conclusions are not only in imagination - such as Speikenisis and its recently built Book Mount - 2
"I'm fun, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaige, walking on the road.
And Stee's Spermon, a IT specialist at a major company's closer, thinks, "No, it's really beautiful."
But I wonder, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, the iPad and the electronic books.
No one's going to such old-modal libraries now, right?
Speikenis, a little notable room town under Rotterdam, belongs to an incredible record.
His population has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
For a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven industrial pools pictured on the banknotes, as a living-written preview from iron.
The success of this educational initiative was modesty.
Then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only opportunity to get statistics: build a library here!
Vinny Maas from the Rotherdam →tectural Office of MVRDV, the master of courageous graphics and the author of ostriums, sometimes even cyclical buildings, related to the task of his usual immunication and came on competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under mouse and smiling on face.
And while the jury members looked up and washed with their shoulders, the Maas, made his original gift of piramides in size and finished things in the protection of his project with the words: "Respected beasts!"
That's my proposal: "The Book Mount" in Speikenis, called "Bookenberg"!
After nine years, this mountain was worth 30 million.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, rather than a number of resident houses and taunhauses in general for 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was marked by the second premium of the Competition of the World Library of the Netherlands in 2012.
The draft is also involved in the 2012 National Netherlands Concurrence of Tree Protections.
Thus, an unlikely premium, which could not earlier offer anything except the postmodernist frontier zone and the amazingly unbequest warfare, white phases that point to the view of milk carrier, is more rich to one modern production of the electury.
But the most important thing in Speikenis was the first public in the history of this town from cultural assignment.
Long Path to the Book
First impression: Eldorado under the cup of sugar.
There is only one lift in the center of the Mountain Mass, for true worshippers of the electural and reading will prefer to investigate this rate by foot.
It is light and easily observed by all sides, the fields of a burned kirpich and the elegant spectacular funds are unfortunately creating a sense of public urban area.
The city environment is perfect.
It looks unfortunately looking for shoes, dogs and players for football boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Only, the booking fields stand at the middle of the phases, and in the middle there is a big dark hall, as usually inappropriate and inevitable," says Vinny Maas.
We set a classic config of spaces from the foot to the ground and brought out the area to read outside.
The internal area of the Mount is used in knowledge: offices, internet library, shaching clubs, environmental centre and technical spaces are available in the centre.
In particular, black books, which serve the wall, the parapets, and the trailing perils, are particularly glad.
Their species, texture and smoke are unusual.
Even the tested engineers and engineers are lost in opinions that it is not a material.
"We were trying to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, a project manager representing the Speikenisse community, with the requirements of the standard.
And once on one agrarian undertaking in Frisland, we met a suitable farming product.
For many years in the heat and on the fields in the Netherlands, as a basket under the root, the experimental volonic material of the limetre dilution has been applied.
It's nice and economy time.
The tone textile serves one or two seasons, and then it can be cut out.
For the library, the first of these volumes was printed in the broadband of four centimeters.
The so-called landbauplastic (KLP) is converted into dark, unique, continuous material, a little reminding of the new car and a little cross.
It's 105 degrees to the top.
Whoever overcomes the road of approximately 500 metres will be rewarded in a literature coffee not only by a tastical species to the city but also by the Netherlands croquets and the wooden fissus in the worms.
They will forget the atmosphere, and in the first place the proper air power on the literature mountain.
Costs for a new soul
"It is hard to believe, but it is from, despite the steel tops, it is a model project in the environment," says Trobourst.
The heat of the earth is used to deploy and refrigerate.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glassed cow, even in clear days the sun is just inside for a little while.
Width farms of a wooden tree, divided by a glass fashion, give shadow and take greater than the sunlights.
The climate in the house is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection of automatic rolls are fully protected.
Ste_Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaige was here too.
As well as the Chinese traditional medical teacher, Sintia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Speikenis, which has been lacking for a long time".
Reason: In a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to invite one book from its own meeting.
These books had to take empty spaces on the fields yet not completely comprehensive library - at that time there were 70,000 books.
I've had a idea.
The poles are confidential.
"Nothing worse than half-level library," says Vinny Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain way with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this publication.
Even if she serves only for beauty.
Hence, MVRDV has been able to resolve the royal task called for identity on the professional gargon.
Speikenis wrote his literature story.
And let them be very young and unfair.
It's just a starting point to build identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany continued by voting on Palestinian recognition.
Stephen Sabo, an expert on the relationship between the United States and the United States, thus equilibrates Berlin to the highest diploma of the track.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany dreamed to understand that she voted against the Palestinians' application to receive the status of the observer in the United Nations.
But then Berlin stopped by voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israel's actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be steadfast in relation to its activities with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - not too critical to Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also continued to vote on the introduction of a prohibition zone for flights.
Finally, the NATO had made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a reading position on complex matters?
Yeah, that's it.
The matter is that it is in the process of transforming its external policies, which is, as a result, goes over from the policy that the United States had, in particular, governed to the own German external policy.
Moreover, the situation is complicated by the lack of a single policy.
Thus, Germans are again between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they have not been used to do so.
I believe that while they're just playing their role, they're on the way to the "meer normal" external policy.
A external policy conducted by France or United Kingdom.
What does the "normal" external policy mean with German viewpoint?
It is ready to take place in its national interests, not depending on the position of the United States or of Peeis partners.
I believe that the German external policy depends on economic policy, which is exporting and relating to certain regions such as Russia, China or Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and therefore Germany should protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the near-east conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in Middle East, in particular in the Persian Lake.
It therefore needs to be cautious to avoid publicity and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't add this too much importance, it's not a completely united relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the German accounts.
Did Germany retain its positions from the United States when taking important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that the German position and even in the United States is overwhelmed.
That's why I don't think that it was the same drama as in the Libyan issue.
Germany may even receive such a certain respect.
This signals that it should be considered more seriously as a player in the international area and that it should be considered interested.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, the United States were clearly pronounced.
Does the opinions between the United States and many Peeis States have?
In force of the American Internal Policy, such differences are always.
I believe that the Government of Obama in the depth of the soul has sufficient understanding of the position of Pekah.
However, with regard to political situation, the Government cannot openly take place.
I believe that disappointments in opinions are not as significant as always appears.
If you consider the terms between Obama and the Prime Minister of Nethanah, you will notice that Obama is not extremely excited by the Netanyah policy.
Is Germany easy to comply with its close relationships with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the situation of a major partner in the EU with the other?
I think that makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, it would be a few more easier for Germans if it had been a single, despite the political policy, but it is not right now.
Thus, they cannot act in a broader approach and have to place it, based on their own vision.
That's exactly how they progress with.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in you in the general position of Pee.
It is understandable that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of the relationship with Israel.
This was always a fascinating topic.
But I think Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees himself in the role of a major international player, will she really take a major role in herself?
Or does the leading role still be given to Germany?
Germany has not yet been used to do so, it is always uncomfortable and, of course, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the crisis - every time Germany plays an important role, the most different emotions of anti-German are shown.
The Germans are not just to cope with this.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point, Germany is in a significantly more difficult position than the United States.
It must take into account the most different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The impact of the United States on the Peking Policy continues to be weak, but the EU does not actually fill this vaccine, and who remains then?
Germans must just play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like this, it is unfailing or strengthening your unbelief.

"Reserve of trade marks" in China: when Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a worldwide trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what's Armani Polo?
This is officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is designed.
However, it will be guarded until the owners of the original names are asked.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to stand their rights.
"Foreigners become more difficult to protect their trade marks in China," says Thomas Pa’loch, Taylor Wessing company, specialising the rights of good marks on the Mount East.
On my table every week, it appears in a new case of this kind of thing.
The imitators are sufficient to add a few letters to get the right to register their trade marks.
This is Lu-Gu, instead of Prada can be registered in Prada-Kny.
In this way, German undertakings, such as the producer of Puma, are copied fully.
It opens the catalogue with the records of the registration of goods in Peking.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, which also used the name of the model home Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is that Chinese are world champions for the copying and violation of intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are multi-eastern universities sold almost exclusively.
However, the cases of the Pa's fear are not such, but, by order of his trustees, he is opposed to that Chinese undertakings are completely officially obtained from the registration of trade marks and the right to use a name which is already protected anywhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban minpay", the "passager" mark.
This word is associated with "docuans ban".
That is what women are called about rich men.
Chinese authorities don't recognize their fault
"This is the damage of business, it is necessary to be done with this," was defeated by Pa’Loh.
"The trade mark is distracted, the unique situation is lost, the imatge is very suffering."
Financial losses and processes of losses are calculated by millions, especially in the case of dearly copied products.
According to the CLSA market investigation undertaking, China is the third of the amount of 15 billion per year and the fastest market in the market of the stocks.
However, it is difficult to remove doubts in the trade record, and it is worth it.
The process may be until nine years, with an unexpected outcome.
Pa’loch reports about the cases in which the court rejected the demand, since the decree of a long-term opposition became the "real market".
If he doesn't succeed, he'll even have to pay the plagiator because he has caused his trade mark in China, says Pa ́Lah.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
There are also noteworthy cases on graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court with the Building Machine Manufacturer Sany, an undertaking which soon obtained a betonone-producer firm of Putzmeister.
Therefore, Chinese to this pool have the right to use a problem similar to Mercedes star.
The Volvo who bought Geely originally spy was a blue-white logop that reminded BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Lacoste was lost in China by imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with a famous crocodile looking on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of the CTMO marks in Peking confirms that in 2010 the lack of staff and staff equipment there were difficulties.
But last year, "return from the emergency situation in the slave process to the normal."
Yes, the number of inevitable reactions has been decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still waiting for production.
It's worth fighting this dear.
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
The last year, the CTMO has made more than 1.4 million trade marks statements, almost for a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has decadeed the list of new registrations worldwide, reports awareness.
The same is the total number of trade marks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011 1,8 billion assemblies were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration is average of 1280 yuanians or 160.
It is much more to protest, as shows the German family company's joynberg case.
For more than seven years, the concert fights against the Chinese plagiator.
The Germans have succeeded that the illegal production of their car details has been eliminated.
However, the imitator strengthened the Chinese rights to the trade mark joynberg.
This was its own destruction, since the families in Germany are not protected, says Hano Wentzler, president of the Government of the joynberg Chemical Specialities in München.
And the CTMO registration of trade signs refused the claim of monkeys.
True, in both institutions, the joynberg has won, but the opposite side continues to fight up to these pounds.
We need to wait.
The question is now discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Process is extremely the way and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal expenses of food should be taken into account, the company’s archive had to examine even the acts of the age of age to bring evidence of the performance.
Five years ago, gladnberg offered unrealisticly to the opposite side the "six significant amount in" for a resolution.
"From here clearly how precious it is for us," says Wenceller.
The dangers of the Next East are threatened even to be moved into.
And in that case, if the imitators register unprotected trade marks.
Yes, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name of gladnberg for skin and skin products.
Concern has long stopped the production in these areas, but, despite this, the fig to prevent the registration.
"We must be waiting," says Wenceller.
Like him and Pa·loh, German companies are recommended to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to trust the position on the protection of trade marks, but the foreigners should "all that anyway should be protected, also registered in China," says Wenceller.
Otherwise, this can be much more valuable than registration.
Actually, if joynberg loses its last drama on trade mark in the last act, the license collections for its own name must be held on the opposite side, explains Venceller.
Otherwise, we will be exhausted from the market in the segment.
World Day of AIDS: to shoot, to sing, to help
It repeatedly repeated the Hor Imbonggy in Dahlberg, and in Swasiland the poor is a pleasure.
History, above race, over 8733 km.
Sna has been distributed by a pleasure: cowboys, basketballs, female bottles and men's balls pick up and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after this slow growth, the voice of the songs is alt, bas, tenor and coprono, they are, and they are awesome, and follow each other.
And Fit Hopf, 29-year-old director, is almost running out of his motherfuckers when they are with their slight and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, the Medical Psychology Institute in Dahlberg Hor Imbonggy repeated a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetic experts to court.
"Om"Obani" is a very simple thing, every people's voice has its text, and in a completely strange language: Zulu, on which 11 million people speak in Southern, Botswana, Lesoto, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNIDs, the United Nations Affairs Programme for AIDS, worldwide is estimated about 34 million HIV infected.
23.5 million of them will be south.
In Swaziland, 245 000 poor people live.
More than 40 per cent of HIV populations are residents.
For 180 pounds in the village of Essitgeni, Voices for Africa found boss in Germany.
70 of them visit a school prepared for further training.
In 15 or 20 days a month, you can take a headship.
It guarantees a child's money for school, school form, and everyday hot dinner in Gogo.
Imbongs in the Zulus language means a story or a praising.
This room doesn't say running on a ban, so they can sing.
Almost ten years, the horr learns songs in this very mild tongue and even brings them again to the first place where they appeared: south.
Since 8733 km from Dahlberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Estijenna, which depends on the votes of German people.
Infected forty percent
There will be approximately 2,000 people, some of these pounds in the pure wheat of glass and salmons, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died from IC.
It reflects the disease of all Swaziland in Estonia in the miniature: the highest level of HIV infection, the world's lowest delay of life under UNICEF.
The surrounding of the extreme body in men, which evidently reduces the risk of half-infection, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland populations have immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened this village in a joint ship on Weight 2005, but the participants first saw children in children who had not only a parental care but simply: food, clothing, education.
Without school education in the poor country, there are no chances.
It was a private commitment for the department of participants - for a few years to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to receive heat food once a day.
But a year later, the Hor is based on the "Voices for Africa", which has almost been professionally forgotten of the poor poor in Astijen.
Factors on sexual infections
What are the most important diseases translated by sex?
Bacterian IPPs relate to siphilis, chlamidiasis and tripper (gonorea).
Often, IPSPs are HIV, Papiloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Lobby pedicules and chests are related to parasite IPPs.
What are the main groups affected?
Siphilis and honoury are mainly met with men who are sexually engaged with men.
The Robert Koha Institute comes from the fact that at least four of each five cases of syphilis registered in Germany resulted in sexual contacts between men.
Getherosexual adults often faced with sex-transfering diseases are chlamidic infections, trihomonias, candidates, honorrhee and papiloma-virus.
The spread of HIV among adults is comparatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are on this group.
Clamidia infections are met more frequently among youths than among other population groups.
According to Peeis data, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We are also often meeting a papiloma virus among young people.
How is the number of infection cases changed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to registration obligations.
Sifilis disease, given by Robert Koha Institute, was more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate the illness of the vener?
Infectional diseases may cause genital disorders, complaints on mosquito, disorders, life-based pains, as well as puzzles or inflammation.
However, they are often not suffering from pain and other symptoms and remain unremarkable.
How can we protect?
Reservates are able to reduce the risk of infection, but they do not give 100 percent protection.
In part, sickness rebuilders in sex may also be distributed by contact infection and by closely contacted contacts.
The experts therefore recommend regular investigation, especially when sexual partners are frequently changed.
In the early diagnosis, the majority of IPAPs can be treated and avoid remote consequences.
The leadership, leadership, and nonetheless honourers for the statement of people throughout Germany are allowed to collect something.
"We have sent it all to Estijen, about 200 000," says Anne Lennartz, the president of the Assembly.
In the most village of Germany, the Codewa Dlamina is a cognitive and active woman.
She also forgets that the poor ones are well built, such as one of the grandfathers.
Goos, as they call the Zulus old women, is the opposite of the village.
They have adopted up to 14 sisters, giving them a cross over them, and forgeting that children in the form of their lessons each day.
Those who are not born have progress to Hanisil, a single woman who receives a salary from the unit, as well as two honeys prepared every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, the "Voices for Africa" unit organized a Swiss school, built two smokers and together with the United States Health Organization organized a HIV analysis for many villages.
It is difficult, but the disease that is so obvious throughout the country prefers to quiet.
King with 14 Women
"Id is an absolute tab," says Anne Lennartz, "for he is sexual."
It is quite unusual for the country where the king officially has 14 women.
The latest absolute mon of black, King Msvati III, is his love for losses.
Poligamy instead of democracy.
In particular, in such a sanctioned state, the lifestyle is also guilty of the IC virus that has been spread so fast in the past years.
But it is also located on shipwrappers who broadcast the virus on the country.
Free reservations are literally on each angle, says Anne Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
The second culture is the flesh to the flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, Ibmognie horse every two-three years a swimming southern and singing songs, full lobsters, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern edge of the black continent have known since the apartment's time.
The bus, full of white songs in the black language, is not only a recognition that brings good thought and joy, but it even causes a weakness in the eyes of severe borders.
Easy is always leading to Estijen, where the songs visit subheaded children.
Although a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, it is more than it is in the valley of Ecclesiastes.
"Go to Ezitena, there is a light," said the nice people.
And after a 8733-km flying back to Dahlberg, when the singers return to the Repetition Hall on the street Bergheimer, you can see that this light is burning also here.
Sensor: NASA opens ice in Mercurie
The Missenger Zone found evidence that there is ice on the Mercurie planet.
The ice cover may have a width of 20 meters.
The United States Nassa has demonstrated the presentation of ice on the Mercurie planet.
Although it is more close to the sun, there is also a deep water, as appeared from three studies held on Thursday in the special magazine Science.
The Messinger Zone found evidence of the constant covering of ice in the sky of the planet.
Its height must be at least 30 centimeters, perhaps even 20 metres.
Previously, water occurs with comet or maybe asteroide, I'm coming with Mercurie.
No one relates to the opening of ice with life on the planet, said the Scientist of Shawn Solomon.
Mercurie temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help to explain how water and other buildings are the elements of life in other places of the Solar System.

One of the biggest and clearest photos of the Habble telescope: Waterport Galla
On the basis of flower prevention, the photos of spray galls are converted into the current experiences.
The photographed by the South-Peeese observer shows that Trifid is remote for several thousands of light years in the Star of the Arrow.
The name is Trifid from the Latin term trifidus (trich, three-partal) because the dark seats are divided into three parts of the diluted heart of the stars.
In the Smith Star, the astronomic photography is the predictor of the crowd: 400 million world years from the Earth’s nuclear of two glasses are weakened and unsecurely occurred.

In this lightly lighting gala with a small black duck still have no gas.
Researchers assume that it has occurred almost before the Great Explosion when the universe was mainly hydrogen.
Our views on the universe: the most important telescope
The telescope was probably obtained in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - even before Galileo Galileo came to monitor the stars for a year later.
From that pool, optical telescopes have become more, and their view of space has become more deep.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the "Hale" telescope was the greatest telescope in the San Diego observatory.
The star pictured here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the "Big Binock" telescope.
It allows you to look into the space with two stars, each diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Green Telescopio Canarias has a huge internal device - a single diameter of a screen is only 10.4 metres.
The Star of the Large South African Telescope is segmentated in South Africa for reduction of price.
However, in the diameter it reaches approximately 11 meters.
The lack of the unfair to the active execution: the telescope is strictly aligned under the vertical angle, and it is to be understood.
The telescope " Hobbie-Eberley" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His particularity: high light ability.
It reaches, despite a comparatively small diameter of the stars, the major global telescope parameters.
A radiotelescope in Arisibo (Puerto Rico) is assisted by researchers to advocate foreign signals in the space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Taking part in the foreign search project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its calculating power.

"Very big telescope" here is a completely corresponding name.
Its four stars allow to light in the visionary tube even the average infrastructure.
It is also planned to establish a very large telescope in the Chile.
Its main star must be cut off in a total of 42 meters and will be composed of approximately 1000 star elements.
However, the graphs should be expected not before 2018.
Before 2007, the "Kek" telescope in the Hawaiian Wood of Maun Kea was considered the most important worldwide.
There are two stars of a diameter of ten meters.
The telescope "Kek" is the Maun-Kea observatory, which also looks at them in heaven with the Sobar telescopes and IRT.
Moreover, a new giant telescope must be presented on Moun-Kea, with a star diameter of 30 meters.
Here they can be loved by illustrations.
However, the most important species of the space set up the "Habble" space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has set pictures of worlds remote.
Since March 2009, the "Ke'r" space telescope will search for the planets for the solar system - especially those on which the life is.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates were found since the start of the mission.
The latest preparation of the telescope "Ke'r" has been signed on the graph.
The kosmical telescope James Webba (JWST) will be sent to the space before 2018 on the board of Arian 5 raket.
The main telescope's infrastructure spectrum is a diameter of 6,5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: He must seek a big explosion by the light of the first stars and the galaxy.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the south pool of Mercuria.
However, there are no reliable data on this, since the " Messander" turns closer to the northern area of the planet.
The decades-based plans indicated that there is ice in Mercurie for decades.
Thanks to the "Messenger" zone launched in 2004, the first turning around Mercurie, the scientists are now sure.

Travel through the Talish Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
Microauthobus with sounding is broken outside the highway outside the wooden forests of hills, storms and simple Christian houses.
Everything around is so green and light that you can think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southern end of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
This is one of the peoples of Kawka, about which there is a little, is only what they say in the Farsi and in the Azerbaijan and are different from the long-term.
The final item is Laric.
The small city is too difficult for the Soviet Soviet Times, which does not really harmonize with the vital mountain landscape.
Turists from the nearly not coming here, the way from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too disturbing.
323 miles away is eight hours, because the road has only one road.
The legendary riches that the country is committed to the Caspian Sea oil here, in the province until it reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) was convinced that there is nothing to interest tourists in Larica.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by the festival of the song, and in the year we have a festition of the elderly people of the world," says Fatulaev.
She's a long-term museum manager, probably the only one in the world.
A biography has been documented here about eight decades of the talents of over 100 years. Fatulaeva points to black-white graphy.
It's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At age 136, he was born another child
But the star of the Museum is the Shirali Muslim chaban, which would have been fulfilled as 168 years.
Birth testimony, however, not.
In view of the age of 122 years of age, Muslim’s age is extremely suspicious.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, 136 years old as a daughter.
Has Muslim's chain added a couple of decades to his age?
In fact, even Rembrandt Scholz, age study from the Plank Institute in Rostoke, heard about the debtors in Central Asia.
"Too many people of age can also meet in some areas of China, Japan, or in the Sunsa valley of Pakistan," says Scholz, "the Sardinian also lives extremely much old people."
However, because of the lack of documents, scientists under age have not been implied because there were no civil status records.
Each day, the steel of oil
Yet, there is a fact that people in the area of Laric have often reached the Bible’s age.
Now there are 20 people older than 100 years old.
Why is this so many debtors in the south?
The Azerbaijan Farid Mughimzade's expertise explains that by the genes of the wallets.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, in contrast, believes that it is in food.
The balls love meat, bread and most milk products, and many drink the oil of the oil every day, but the high calorian diet can be healthy with the diotolog of the view.
Or the case in the first way of life that keeps people in youth? In Chengemering, a small village near Lerik, Rubab Mizjev lives.
At 97 years, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mizjeva, who claims that she has 143 offspring, lives in a simple tree house, typical for all the Kazakhs region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bottle of oil, which without a whistle catches out there.
There will be eight men, including one of the sons and the daughters of Mizcai, who have had their sons for a long time.
Two little ones are going near too.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared under the typical puzzles of the armode.
It has perfectly white and white teeth, which is hiding the long dark and russian hairs that her son is revealing to us.
I always have the hair with milk, so they have never fallen out and kept the color.
"And I never had a shampoon," says Mizjeva.
A monthly pension is enough for life
She always has just grown up in her own court, mysteries, cartoons, mountains.
I've never bought any products in the store for all my life.
Then she tells her husband who served in the army.
The most difficult was after World War II.
But it's been better when the "love father" Gadar Aliev got up on the road.
The propaganda does not often sound in the cases of an old woman.
However, the culture around the father of a nation, which ruled by the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan is almost not aware of the border.
He was under authority until 2003, then his son, Ilham, adopted the ship of the rulership.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijan elders.
230 monates (approximately equal to the same amount) Mizjeva receives each month as a pension, for those who are able to live well.
And maybe the growing son of Mizzay also has been the right: "Starics in our culture use deep respect."
They will be in a large family, loved, surrounded by a band, and happy.
What's not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word " Human Rights" does not exist in the constitution
Revolution returned to Cairo.
The opposite demonstrations in Cairo testify about the depth of the country.
The future constitution, which is on the shariate, has met a wrathful opposite.
The Egyptian president did not buy paphos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success is on my responsibility to the people and to the people," he said on the public television.
His speech was turned to all the people, but first to Christian captains, liberals, museums and non-religious Egypt.
Because all of them, who are unexpectedly in disturbing opposition, experience fear.
The fear of the religious state in the Nile for the powerful "Brothers Muslims".
Mohammed Mursy, almost without excuse, said that he had temporarily cut off the constitutional court's competence and extended his competence to save the revolution.
However, what he actually wants to save a 61-year-old engineer who has the degree of the American University of South California doctor will not be clearly filled with Egypt and all the world.
Will the judiciary have no power?
In fact, 234 articles have been held in a 15-hour 15-hour spring with obstacles to the islamist constitutional meeting of 100 participants, which is partly caused to be anxious.
Like in the previous constitutions, the project states that the legal production is based on " the principles of the Islamic Right".
But what does "princes"?
It was and remains an interpretation, and it could be feared that islamists would use a spreading formula and a legal luft for more closer interpretation of the chariate.
At least one of the newly introduced articles: In all cases, Casa's chariata, the highest islamic institution of the country, which is used by the greater authority in the Sunnith Islam, should be attached to the Council of the University of Al-Ashar.
This should not, but it may mean that the church is supervising the law that the de fact would have the consequence of the judicial authority.
The draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Another issue: Citizens ' sentence to military court should be maintained.
These courts during the Mubarak authorities served to press oppositioners.
Following the dictator in the military prison, up to 11.000 citizens were found.
Also, as stated in the project, the State should protect "the true substance of the Egyptian family" and "the support of its moral and value".
It is legally not so clear that the State institutions with this article can control even the contents of the film and literature.
The open text does not mean anything other than the censure.
In fact, none of the articles set up directly men and women.
So the other prohibits the prophet Mushammed and his messengers to be slain.
But what's about it and how it should be done, it remains unexpected.
It also represents a formula that is prohibited by the "manifestation".
Is it enough for the president's charitation or the crafts of justice?
The question of interpretation as well as much in this draft, which Murcy will sign and which, as he said, "very soon" will be represented by Egypt to the referendum.
"Revolution returned"
There are a few weeks of opposition against the excellence of the islamists.
Decades of thousands of people gathered together on Friday evening on the Tachir area in Cairo and swore to set up this document before he entered into force.
"Revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place on presidential elections.
Laureat of Nobel's peace premium and the former atmosphere of the international atomic knowledge of Mohammed El Baradai stated that the constitutional project was the place "for the story.
Twitter's short news service he accused Mursy's complainants to call on "the way against democracy".
"If he declares a reference, we'll go to his court and throw it down," said Oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We have not yet established, our brothers' blood has not yet been rejected," quoted the Egyptian media for the mass information of the opposition policy of Haleda Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it ineffective.
Coran is our constitution.
The "Brothers Muslims" were well organized, in their turn, calling to the opposite demonstration, but, of caution, not at Tachir, but after a massive prayer at the other Neal before the Cairian University.
It has participated in a large number of women under the coverages and the ligators of salafites who cried, "The people requires the application of God's law."
They need Mursy: "Clear the country!" and they assured, "The Coran is our constitution."
The fight for the authority over the symbolic area at which everything began is a prosecutor of the practical civil war.
Mussi's followers, obviously, didn't want to go to this risk.
The " Muslim Brothers" said that both the opposers and the parties of the Constitution project were sound and clear.
It has now been time to give the people a decision in the electoral urna in which the country should go.
The majority of islamists is considered a decision.
"The understanding of the human rights" isn't mentioned at any time"
Hafiz Abu Saed in anger from this forced constitutional process, which, likely, had to be extended to February with all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization protected the " Muslim Brothers" when they were sitting at Mubarake or before the court.
Not because he separated them from peace, but because the rights of the human rights are for him.
That's why he was killed, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are no longer met in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The enlargement of the influence of Mursi on all three branches of the State disappoints.
These measures are evident attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will bring Egypt to the new dictature.
"Instead of strengthening the civil State, the President de facto has cancelled it," Saida regrets.
Since civil public organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saida feels that all left him, even the international community, looking at the ideological fight against the Neil directions with the mixing of entertainment and pressure.
It could be a payment for this.
The Tachryr demonstrate warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian cancer: is the most foolish fish in the world?
The 5 million people of Norway have one of the highest levels of life not only in the world but also in the world.
Maybe the secret of the success of this country is somewhat appealing to one extremely evil fishing food?
Take a few reviews.
Place them in a poor and poor clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get a disturbing crack-shopping, one of the most famous Norwegian partcates.
I'm in a small town named Fagernes, in three hours of ferry from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air, it's differentiating an inevitable nature of shadow.
Racfisc is a foral, a soap salt and shiping in water for a year, depending on what soul it is to be achieved.
As soiling and cold is cold, the norwegians are gathered to the festival in Fager, which is dedicated to itself, say that it is a pleasant food.
"There are eating grass and drinking by a Roman Acvavite, a dark wodka," explains Havard Halvarsen, a professional fuel on the profession and the association of the "racfisic general", which will be conducted by the officer.
Everywhere around us, people eat broken with small fish cubes and drink it with a lot of spit.
"Nobody likes more accumulation than cancer," says Havard.
This drink is able to break the smoke.
I'm trying a couple of kids.
If you can take the ball under your nose, it's not so bad - a little different from the dry portion that you've been carrying for a long time in the bus.
Racfisc is a Norwegian product from other times, the poverty time when, before colds appear, the eggs were locked in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then the deep winter, when the fish had already been well and fundamentally forgot, it was extracted and used in food, increasingly.
Moreover, in the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norways were forced to leave their country in the search for work and migrate mainly in the United States.
Now, the population is stressful - more than 13 per cent of immigrants, which are drawn to slave places, high payments and the development of security systems.
Inhabitants of Sweden (earlier opposite, and not so long and much more alive neighbors) are coming to work here.
Racphish is considered as a significant symbol, unchanged, even a few of the evil elements of the past Norway.
It's one of the most precious foods.
On the other hand, there's a sweet beer bottle or sandwich that will take you to 9 pounds of sterling (14 pounds of US).
Norway is rarely present in the world news, and most of the people of the country seem to make it possible.
People here before this couple have not yet mentioned the name of Anders Bravic, the racist and extremist of the right, the one who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the therapy is called "the happening 22 July".
The Norwegians are very difficult to believe that one of their companions in their peacekeeping country has been capable of such beasts and murder.
Today Norway's welfare is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventy) one of the most important oil plants in the world.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our flowing," says Anna, our officer, with a long-light hair, and a deeply deep eye, and the north of well-being.
We are a people -- as you call it -- reasonable.
Like most norwegians, she speaks English.
We don't like showing, we're not angry.
Norway is very interested in its oil - most of the incomes of oil growth are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years in which the world financial crisis had occurred, when all of them had no money, Norway was strictly calculating all costs.
"When you can go on the winters and walk in the courses of summer, it's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a cancer," adds it with a laughless smile.
I'm standing in the snow in the rows of some food. I'm crazy.
Here's a hamburger with a hot meat, it's just an exotic, a sweet sugar meat.
But tonight we are still more than the same fish with an unforgettable smoking.
In my holiday, a special dinner, dedicated cancer, in which the visitors determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
And it's a direct television in which it's a leader in a babe-case, surrounded with cancer.
This seems to be a song competition "Eurovideance".
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what kind of fish are you put in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here's our boyfriend."
They're all laughing and smoking.
Somebody's falling out of the chair maybe over the aquavite.
Or maybe just breathing in this fish.
The President of Enrique Pnya New is a difficult beginning of the career.
Until the newly chosen President Me'ki Enrique Pnya Newt is ready to enter into a position, the co-responsor BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he needs to face and to the mixed expectations of his country.
Before the movement in Mexico now is especially weeping.
This city was transported and at the best time, and from Monday there were hundreds of charges that broke a few key engines to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, it was done not to allow people to reach from the premiums, but to prevent protest parties from submitting to Parliament's opinion.
On Sunday, the new Chapter of Enrique Paña New will take the presidential commitment and accept the national government's burden.
It's an unsimple task before him.
I have received good economic indicators in the Federation of Felipe Calderon, which now has its powers, but the country has violated the war of drugs, which has brought 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government declares to the people Me'ka about his willingness to cope with violence," Mr. Paña New President of the United States Baraku Obama in the White House's so-called office earlier reported.
I'm going to offer a new security that will allow us to achieve this goal.
The political career of Mr. Paña Neto was developed at the position of the Governor of his family of Mexico.
His family, in a guestone and extensive country around the country's capital, was divided the opinions of the new ruler.
A molecular person
In the image of Vale-de-Bravo, for example, it is reminded of warmly.
Inhabitants put him into service tourism, the development of a curortal field and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new sexes built by Mr. Paña Newto, which are very different from the road with the rocks and jackets that were before.
Tables with his name will be held at the present opinion of the Centre and on the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate changes.
"We engage with him hopes for real and serious changes," says his friend Gabriel Olver Ernandes, the Congressman of the State of the New Institution-Revolution Party (PRI).
We are expecting real and resolved changes that are so strict to our country, first in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of uninterrupted residence, the PRI party was exhausted in 2000 in 2000 in Wissente Fox.
The Congressman of Olver admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential court of Los Pineos, the party is a great hope for Enrique Paña Neto.
Furthermore, he rejects the accusations of inconsistency, which has made the new president of opposition.
He is very direct and dedicated to his future vision.
It's a great State act, and, above all, a person who can listen.
However, in the other part of the state, many people had a different view of the former Governor.
The Municity of Nesawalkootl, who is also called Sudad Nes, is the most disturbing contrast with the potential of Vale de Bravo.
He is hidden under car magazines, in many ways, a recompense of Mexico himself.
Problems in Municipality also have a severe nature of this megapolis.
This year previously, for the reduction of drug trafficking bands in these areas, army had been held, and violence against women has been a deep nature here.
Only in the last two years, a few decades of women killed were found in the empty near the wide range.
More than thousands of women were killed in Mexico during the Government of Mr. Paña Neto - this is significantly higher than the same indicator in the proudly celebrated city of Suid-Huares, whose name was a narcatic in the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Paña Neto, in the best case, he can be said that he did not face the problem of murdering women during his stay at the position of the Governor.
In the worst case, his administrator is accused of fully ignoring this problem.
An inhabitant of the beton house, like most houses in this remarkable area, Irenea Bundia hardly holds the tears with my pictures of her relaxed daughter Marian Luna.
According to the official version of Marian, suicide was committed in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her companion.
"When I reached her home, her body appeared to be buried before it," mentioned Mrs. Bundia.
There were signs of what it was killed, and the body was already cut off.
Mariana's mother refers to this story, and the portrait of the daughter looks on us from the wall, where he will stand near the cross, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That was exactly what they said, that the family was rejected.
"The duty states have regarded me as an old host, an insufficient refrigerator of peace.
They want people to accept all that they say and deceive.
But that's wrong, especially when so many injuries and injuries around it," she says.
As the presidential commitment on the Sabbath, President Paña Neto will take a lack of responsibility with herself.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Me'ca have been affected by crimes with violence, and the new president has promised to solve this problem as a priority during his rulership.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the Governor," says Olver, the Congressman of Vale de Bravo from the Pri party.
However, most of this are concerned about the victims families in South Nes.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about bad treatment, he's charged.
Prosecutors are trying to reject Bradley Maning statements on the bad conditions of the content.
In the hearing proceeded, manning was highly focused in the military campaign in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires to close the case on the fact that Maning's conclusion was violent.
The United States Native Army is charged with a number of thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the accusation was attempted to prove that Bradley Manning, who was accused of the greatest escape of the materials in the history of the United States, did not bear a complaint on bad treatment, which he said, he had to be transferred in the military campaign.
During a cross-border consultation in Fort Mide, Maryland, the military prosecutor of Major Ashden Fein stated that the records of every weekly visits by the representatives of the administration within nine months of its content in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints for bad treatment.
A cross-border investigation in the consideration of the defence of the Maning case on the fact that the conditions of its conclusion were cruel and itself were a sufficient penalty, was carried out on the day following that Maning stated that he was under the plan of committing suicide.
A military expert for the analysis of information, arrested in June 2010, is accused of covering a number of thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were later repeated on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Maning.
During the hearing on Friday, the Prosecutor Phine and Maning reviewed the reports that were completed after Maning's visit by the representatives of the Administration during its residence in Quantico, where he was under the conditions of a strict conclusion regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the employees asked Maning questions and replied his answers.
When the prosecutor Fain asked on Friday reports, Manning recognized that he appreciated the treatment of the administration as a "excellent" and the general terms of conclusion as "very professionally organized".
The reports undertaken are not complaints for bad treatment, despite that Maning was directly asked about the conditions of its content, Phine approves.
Maning replied that he expressed orphanty with these problems and that his representatives of the Administration discussed these issues with him and claimed that they would be concerned, but not in writing.
"They wrote "They have no problems" (after my complaints), but that does not mean that I have not raised this topic in the conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Dennis Lind, also asked Maning why he did not complain about an irregular treatment with him in January 2011 at the meeting of the Commission, which examined the su·da·da, which he expressed in writing within a few months before.
Maning replied that at the meeting he wanted to get out of his "tree warning" regime and mixed the conditions of closing.
The representatives of the military leader explained that the conclusion regime was introduced in order to protect the prisoner and the security of others.
"I wanted to tell the administration that it was okay with me to cancel the warning regime of tragedy... to improve my life level from my point of view," said Maning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed about his arrest in Iraq and the translation to Kuwait, where it was nearly two months before it was transferred to the military sea base to Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that once he lost conscience because of a strong grief.
He explained that psychologically hard when you don't know how your participation is decided and what's happening in the outer world.
"My world fell down to the base of K'P-Ariffan, to the sizes of my own," said Maning on Thursday.
- I'm going to die in this cell."
Maning was in Quantico, as he said, spent most of the time in the small camera - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a week - in full unity.
Manning reports that he has been allowed to leave only a matras, a clothes, a few clothes, a few objects of clothes, and pockets.
He says he was trying to move, because sleeping or even lying at daily time were prohibited.
Maning said, during his dream in his eyes, there was a light that went outside the cameras.
If the guardians did not see him when he was turned into bed night, he was built and forced to turn to his back.
The Lawyer Maning presented an official reaction on the conduct of irregular treatment with Maning in January 2011.
In April 2011 Maning was transferred to military office to Fort Levenworth, Kansas.
Moreover, on Friday, the judge asked Maning of the statement he had made during the report on Thursday, that after one night he was made to sleep in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guardians and other prisoners on the morning check.
Manning said he had no opportunity to cover his clothes during the check.
In response to the question of the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guardian's order that he had to cast a clothes that could be covered, but admitted that no one just commanded him to cast it.
On Thursday, Manning said that the last night he was made to sleep a naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning told that he told the officer that he could use a series of traps or slepans to traupe himself, but he didn't do it.
That night, according to Maning's witness, his lower white, the Sleeps and the eyes took away from the camera.
He hopes that the judge will at least learn what he had to survive during his conclusion and will decrease the term of conclusion, if Maning is recognised by a guilty military court that should begin considerating his case at the beginning of the year.
The Defence claimed that it was planning to propose Maning to recognize less serious crimes and other accusations to dismiss as excessive.
The renewal of the hearings is planned for these outcomes, expecting the complaint party to establish that the conditions of the content were justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was contained in Quantico with rules governing the content of arrests with a maximum strict regime.
Among the complaints issued to Maning, there is a complaint to the opposer, an illegal impact on the discovery of data on the Internet, the transmission of information on national defence and public property or documents.
If he is convicted by all items of the accusation act, he may be threatened by a living conclusion.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the Americans of origin.
According to the author, many of the ends had to leave me because they were disabled.
The ends are deceived to blame those who went away because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that I am disrupted between two cultures.
During the recent driving in Mexico, I went through the corridor for the coming people, approached the border control area and stood on.
Symbols were indicated on two sides: one for Mexico (mean ends), second for Extranieros (foreigners).
I stood before them a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in California, and my life was called the end of my life.
It's just a conditional name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irelandians, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later, I stopped on the complex "American origin."
But here I was in Me'ke.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditions or complex names.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish enough good to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary stock is poorer than the language carriers, and I can't be released from the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and it's for extranieros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the elected president Me again visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was used to meet the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Paña Newto has spoken of the appreciation of the economy of the Canadian economy, which makes the ends now, with the same success, to stay in Me'ka, rather than to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to establish a North American trade block in the likeness of Rose.
Furthermore, President Paña Neto had promised to continue war against drug carriers in Me'ca, but no specific proposals were presented.
For me, with the United States, an issue of old mistakes is difficult and committed.
Most Americans have never thought that in 1848 the United States entered Me'ak and forced her leaders to refuse half their territory.
But the ends think about me for centuries, not for minutes, and see reminders of those events all over.
This is why only any State party of the United States should be pronounced by the term of criticism from Me'ka, in the press and in the midst of the elite of the Cana community, there are claims that the Americans have reached the sovereignty of the neighbourhood.
And the seeds of Montesums are executed by military.
In this case, I am the most complicated by me with more than 35 million Americans of the Canadian origin in the United States.
Do you want to talk about mistakes?
That's enough.
I have winners and losers, people in this country, and those for whom there is no such.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people had the origin of Cana only for one reason: at some time, their family history, any father or grandfather, had no opportunity to meet themselves in Me’ca and had to go north.
Most of these were the ends of a certain kind of - smuggling, small - of poor Christian families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
It's different in Me.
Today, our lives are the inflation of America's fight, we learned in good schools and have made good works, but we don't forget that even this is American but not canaine.
Our national self-determination is not clear, but we know what country to consider.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the Canadian Elite and the Governing Class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating distress, and they refer to us as a second sort of people, as to those who do not exist.
We do not speak well Spanish, and our relationship with Me is not sufficiently strong.
Only our ambition for them is explained as a failure.
If our forefathers had succeeded in Me, they would not have gone.
We wouldn't have been now after a stuck intention to find life in the United States but lose spiritual relations.
My wife was born in Guadalahhara and was still moved to the United States, and this reminds me that between the current enemies and the Americans, some trends of origin, and the ends clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans are injured by this.
She is a United States citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my known Americans have not felt the origin of any of them.
We listen to the Los Tigres del Norte group, but we love Bruce Springstin.
When you get the best out of two worlds, you're not sure you're losing roots.
In Me'ka, we're Americans.
And in the United States, I'm called the ends.
Now, as I have found during my driving, as if we are not inadequate, some of the leaders and representatives of the intellectual will want to restore the diaspore.
They want the Americans to work on the origin of the United States and to represent its interests.
We could tell our friends-American about what country it is and how well it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen the contact with Me.
Yeah, of course.
Don't get out of anything.
Too much trouble in the past.
In view of the breakdown between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so already.
Excuse me, but understand it yourself, amygo.
And that's fair.
If part of the ends before this pool can not forgive the United States how they have done with Me half a century ago, they must also accept the fact that some Americans are still in trouble with their relatives in Me recently.
Yeah.
Please, we have more general than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
A Agreement on the Suspension of Fire between Israel and the Hamas Group may be a major fund for further peace
Is there a long-term peace between Arabs and Israel in the Middle East?
The general circulation of blood proliferation stresses the vitality of such hopes.
It seems to be normal, uncertain disputes about the first beginning; mentions are converted into the wilderness; murdered above 140 Palestinians, most of whom citizens were constituted, and six Israel; first during the conflict issued from Gaza's territory, the racket of the rackets in the surroundings of the capital of Israel Tel Abib and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite that Israel and Palestinians were unexpectedly involved in their extreme conflict, changes came to the Middle East.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab waves have been circumcised in a crucial storm, and the Palestinians and Israel were not able to stay in the wind of the region.
As a result, their fight may become even more bloodproliferant than earlier.
However, there are reasons for the hope of the outcome of this tube.
War without winners
In the first view, the situation is not a result of optimism.
Even if the end of the fire, which was signed on 21 November, will be fulfilled, the end of this week only strengthened the position of the forcers on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Motion Hamas, who came to the authority of Gaza in 2007, claimed that they forced Israel to depart, despite their losses.
Although some grouping leaders have been locked and 1.7 million of people are locked in one of the most popular and difficult angles of our planet, Israel was not able to set up Hamas.
Hamas actually increases its population in the West Jordan River, another Palestinian territory, which is currently controlled by more moderate Fatch movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can conclude that time is working on them.
As the increase in the impact of islamist movements in the Arab world in Hamas, new influences and rich friends are shown.
The regenerating regional leader of Turkey, who had ever been the closest covenant of Israel among the Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas; her example followed Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developments of the Persian Valley States.
Hamas's complaints declare the creation of a islamist half month around Israel, from Lebanon north, in which the militarized Hezbol group is governed, until Syria, where the proslamic rebels are still more prossimist than the government of Bashar Assad, and more until Jordan, where the king's authority is threatened by the Hamas's covenants.
The most significant change in the strength balance in the region has occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most popular and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Muhammed Mursi has strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brothers' movement.
Hossy Mubarak, who was ruled by Egypt for 30 years and was born in 2011, was a world dictator who did not take attention to Hamas' support.
The Muslim brothers, rather, I'm a organization in a lot similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclinated to populism.
In the future diplomatic divisions, Hamas can be a significant player whose voice will not be able to deploy even Israel and America.
At the same time, the strangers in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was thrown.
The Israeli Iron Cookie System justified the costs of its creation and succeeded many of the Hamas rackets.
The citizens of Israel can sleep quietly at least for a while.
As a result of the double, the United States remained faithful to their unchanged position; many Pays of Pee also committed a fault for the beginning of the last area of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially in the Government of Benjamin Netanyah, which is significantly a peaceful process.
Despite the death of approximately 30 Israelites from the rackets issued from the Gaza Sector Territory since 2004, Israel has been able to address the minimum problem of terrorists, part of the wall that is on the western Jordan River, a significant part of the Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish residences that continue to be extended despite the illegality of such situations from the view of the international law.
The position of the Prime Minister of Nathaniahu, whose Likud party, in the framework of the preparation for elections intended on 22 January, has been accompanied with more aggressive conservators under Avigdor Liberman, is fully appropriate.
What is the meaning of building the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they give all the authority in their hands in the West Territory, will they not begin to run the rackets from there to Israel, how do they do their collectors in the Gaza sector?
It is better to keep them outside the wall and heavy pressure for every attempt to rise.
It may be that the "worst" sides will be won, but their accounts may be an examination of the Arab weight.
As islamists who come to Egypt and other countries experience not the warmest feelings of Israel, their priority will become internal problems.
The defense part of Israel ' s budget is more than all its Arab neighbours together.
The resolve of war with regional overseas will help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their own economy.
The practice of the president of Egypt, Mursi, who worked together with Barack Obama over the stop of fire, is a good sign and can indicate the beginning of change.
Israel, at least, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democracy changes in Arab countries have been made, the absence of Palestinian right to self-determination is a bomb of a slow action that will be earlier or quickly exploded in the occupied territories of Israel, such as the bus shot in Tel Abive this week.
Repressions are already undermined by the foundations of the democracy in the Hebrew State and the demographic and the growth of the Arab population is only to ruin these problems.
Blood-proliferated operations in the Gaza Sector's territory for the deterioration of Hamas's movement should be maintained by the international community's deficiencies.
Both parties need external impulse
There is the only decision that healthy representatives of both sides call to, as well as the majority of the island peace and our newspaper: education of two states and income of Israel's territories in exchange for security.
There is a hope that it is not too imprisonable in a short-term perpetuity that the stop of fire will allow other countries to be more effectively influenced on the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which has been determined for a long time to make the provision of weapons in the Gaza sector, as well as Turkey and Katar, have had as never been the opportunity to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the common use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also strive to reconciliate Hamas and Fatch movements.
This would make more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than forward vote in the United Nations, which could result in the recognition of the Palestinian Virtual State.
His role is to put Israel on the negotiations table, too, President Obama.
During his first time, he did not do his own plan of peaceful solution.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the disappointment of joining the solution of this problem.
It's a disastrously unvisible position.
The United States are living interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peaceful agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia entered into force the law on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings on smoking and disorders of parts of the body are contrastly assigned to deep green boxes equal to all cigarettes.
The first of the Australian World Reference on the single packing of cigarettes and tabacco products has entered into force by replaceing the logo and coloring of different masses with the same box of olive olive box with the photographs of the body’s disease and children whose health has been disrupted by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various images and signatures that warn about smoking, the only difference between the packets entered in the binding order of this Sabbath is the name of the march printed by the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world to prepare the packaging of tabacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the goal of this measure is to maintain a youth from smoking, leaving this moderate habit.
Based on that decision, the results of the investigations showed that people who have not started to smoke up to 26 years of age, in 99 cases of 100, never become smokers.
"Obviously, even in the age of children understand the meaning that tabacco companys are trying to bring to the packaging," explains the Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek, based on research that, for example, the crown in the logope is associated with children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the world ' s minimum share of smokers, so these changes will not be made to the arrival of transnational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is already considered by other countries.
The representatives of the Tabacco industry were strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.
Tabacco firms claim that this will only increase the part of the black market in which deep and available cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences that are different from those who have thought of his initiatives," says Scott Macinther, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of China and Indonesia will provide much more of these products for sale in Australia.
Instead, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha from a small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd states that a question on ports and silicon footballs who hide uncomfortable images on the packaging has grown (approximately from zero) from two months ago, such as British American Tobacco, the British Empireal Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where they were trying to accuse this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico already had six thousand goods to public trade undertakings and expected a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential mixture for the efficiency of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of networks among the population in which these measures are addressed.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia, he made an illegal television advertising and supporting their activities, as well as the sellers prohibited to make cigarettes visible, the tabacco advertisement was moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited companies and web sites to place an advertising on the Internet, but it cannot provide outside sites.
"If you commercialize tabacco products and you have only the small laze, the idea of moveing your goods on the Internet will be extremely disgusting for you," explains Becky Friman, who investigates public health issues at the Sidney University.
The company notes the growth of the number of reviews on trade marks written by → as common users in networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this really the case of a regular citizen who loves the cigarettes of Marlboro so much that he has disgraced the force and time and made a video rocket, or is that a public company?
The Australian company's British American Tobacco claims that adults are now more adapted to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the Tabacco Industrie have even taken steps such as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to promote new rules: these States are presenting claims within the World Trade Organization, stateing that trade has been undergone injustices, despite the fact that trade in all these countries with Australia is fully small.
The WTO resolution is expected for the middle of 2013.
According to Tany Plibersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar package laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first commitment to the placement of graphs warning about smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of lacking is considered in Britain, New Zealand, UAR and India.
A lot of tubes in Australia are not demonstratively obedient to new information.
These pictures didn't hurt me.
I just don't care.
"You're just catching the cigarette and hiding the packet in the carmen," explains Victor El Hague, buying the cigarettes with the graphy of the mouth-boat-speaked bottle on the pocket.
Honestly, the only thing that can cause me to leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, a carrier of the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of distributing goods on the stakeholder
"I've had an hour for the new party, and now four hours," he regrets.
"The accommodation was to take and completely prohibit the cigarettes, then we would say, what to do, okay, all over, closing the magazine," he says, "what's going to do?
Building electronic networks and constant connections in the world is not so bad and bad.
On that day of thanks, I had unexpectedly gotten spending five hours at the airport because our airport was found mechanical failures and replaced it with another plane that we had expected.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of shock.
I'm not gonna betray you.
Paul's airport expecting a flight is really awesome, and there will not help any books, magazines, iPhone, even the stores of unusual trade.
However, in recent times, more scientists and experts on development have been expressed in favour of shock.
They say that in certain situations, we and our children are not so bad and bad.
This forces the brain to draw up interesting topics that may contribute to creativity.
And because in the modern world, all of us are always in front of any screen, the advantages of scarlets pass over us.
Maybe we need to strive to be crazy?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll be back to this again.
As many before, I felt that shame was the gain of recent times when people had more free time.
This is not true, Peter Tui, professor of the Greek and Roman History of the Canadian University of Calgari, author of the book "Urder History of Scoki" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale-Press, 2011).
"In fact, shame can glorify a very old story," he says.
The walls in Pompeah have been found latin records on the shock dated in the first century.
There is still an open question of how we understand the shame.
The problem is, says John D. Istud, an adjunct professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of shame were often changed.
After studying the materials of the study on this subject and asked the target group of 100 people, Professor Istud and his colleagues came to the definition: shame is when people " are but are not able to do what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between shame and apatia, he says, is that a foolish man doesn't do anything he wants to do.
It doesn't want to do anything in the apatia.
It says that it is "the disturbance of attention and the disturbance of the attitude and the feeling that the time is slow."
The depression may be very similar to the depression described in the description of the crack.
However, Professor Istud claims that despite a close relationship between these situations, awakening people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and the people who are depressed see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel that we're worried when we're really difficult to focus on something.
In its study of the "Independent": the definition of the crack from the point of attention" in September's issue of the Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Istud and colleagues are addressed to an earlier experience whose participants listened to the vote record of the magazine.
Some participants also heard sounds not related to the case of the television program included in the neighborhood, others heard the same sounds in low volume so that their food could be discovered, and the third group only listened to the voice record without the outside sound track.
Those participants who heard the television with low volume noted that they were sorrowful, often others - were difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons of this and added it to a shame.
When we are trying to end up with the difficult or attract the challenge, the interruption of attention may cause a shame, says Mark J. Fenske, a neurological adjunct at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteressable, "e.g. by looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, a detrimental can help to escape shaking."
It seems that when people begin to hang on the chair or draw the rubbers on the paper sheet, they do it from shaking, but now we know that these actions are just helping not to disturb physically.
"The investigation has shown that children who do not prohibit to raise and turn, learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit humblely," says Professor Fenska.
At some time, we're all trying to get a shock: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to the monotonal thing, looking at a non-interessed movie.
However, different people demonstrate a different degree of decline to shame.
In the 1980s, the researchers had a special " scale of decline to shame" for the measurement of such individual characteristics.
To define this scale, questions are used, for example, "More of what I have to do, just and monotonally" or "I'm too interesting, so there's nothing too much time."
With such questions, researchers determined that the boys were more frequently a girl, " says Steven Wodanovich, professor of psychology at the West Florida University, - especially in the presence of various external disorders.
However, the growth often is often increasing.
In 1991, Rid Larson, Professor of Personal and Public Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he had been associated with a pioneer with nearly 400 growth and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the results: 32 per cent of the adults claimed that they were soft at school and during the implementation of the home task, and 23 per cent claimed that they were worried about a number of schools.
Only 3 percent of parents have noticed that they are worthwhile.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data about the facts of such shame now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "the age of growth is the point of decline to shame", mainly because the growth and growth are not fully allowed to decide what they are doing.
Let's go back to my first question: is it useful?
Sometimes it is not because, in extreme manifestations, it, as a result of research, can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical action, risk asylum games or misuse of certain arts in trying to escape.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the relationship between shame and creation, says Professor Wodanovič, who dedicated the study of this problem for over two decades.
"So our brain suggests us that we should take something else; it's shame," says Gary Markus, psychology professor at the University of New York.
However, this most brain does not always know what is better to do.
If you'll be nice and you'll make this energy for gitary or culinary experiences, you'll make yourself better.
But if you're looking at the television, you'll be better for a while, and soon it's proy.
Therefore, if your child is crazy and you give him iPad, he'll stop to stumbling, but he's not gonna learn to do with a crazy or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fance.
"And such customs of self-regulation are involved in the most different situations," he acknowledges.
Your child is not only learning to do anything self-control, but he also learns self-control.
I don't think you need to carry some shit.
However, it is not worth thinking of something bad.
It is soon to learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of technology and technology.
Professor Istud is with this.
"We see this so that we need to experience more shame, while shame is an extremely unappreciable, unappreciable desire to take something significant," he says.
In fact, people are trying to disappear from constant bottles and simply get delighted.
"In the modern world, we have been used to constantly stimulate emotional organs," he says, "and when silence is still, we lose and we don't know what to do."
Until it is unexpected how the new law on marihuana transparency will be applied in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a student of the public college on the south-east of Colorado, is accused of concluding a voting crime, which concludes that it will soon be legally legally on the entire state's territory: keeping a small portion of marihuana and the tubes in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco says that once in September he and his friends were in Lamara and went to a car on a prery near the border with Kansas when the police stopped them.
After the police found in the Marihuan car, Mr. Orosco came to the Court of Justice for Drugs and Inheritance of Drugs - small offences, each of which is charged by 100 dollars - and appointed the date of the court meeting.
"We're like criminals," says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the indetermination that has continued a few weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for the use of marihuana in small quantities for the time, the decision of hundreds of small courts does not depend on the law as far as the place of consideration.
The accusations of small offences with marihuana are already recorded in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, who adopted a similar measure.
The police party have already stopped to complain people at age 21 and older for the preservation of small doses that will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
However, in more conservative districts, the Prosecutors of Colorada decided to consider the cases with marihuana, and continued to be responsible for the protection of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver to the mountains of the West, they vote not to allow new, licensed marketing states for the sale of marihuana.
"All this develops so effortful that I don't even know what to wait further," says Daniel J. Outs, the police head of the city of Auror on the east of Denver.
The representatives of the controllers in Washington are also deprived of respect.
They should set out rules to determine the licence for production, distribution, and sales of marihuana, and all of this must be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, warns the majority of other States in resolving marihuana use, dream for medical purposes, and now for a time.
"In Colorada, a more harmonised market, therefore they will be a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council on Production Regulations and the loss of alcohol in Washington.
But now no one can do anymore, Mr Smith admits, rather than to submit any proposals and hope that this is what it is doing.
"We don't have a real president that we could orient," he says.
The draft legislation of the state of Washington, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and the whole year will put the State into indetermination when the State licence systems are not yet, and the right to the marihuana ownership has already been legal.
And there are still a simple technology, which must be decided during this period, for example, how to find equality between the "suficient access" state to the licensed marihuana with a prohibition to trade it at a distance of 1000 feet from school, parks, game areas and gardens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed trade undertakings on marihuana in the area of cities, particularly in Sietle and its villages," explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of recently created investigations of the "Center of Marihuana".
On 21 November, the police officer of Oats from Aurora sent his submission to the e-mail report that the prosecutor of the city would no longer attach the 21-year-old persons to the responsibility of possessing a small number of marihuanas, and that the police stops the injury of people from "the beginning".
The police officer Outs reported that the police would monitor the follow-up of the rules in the city governing the activities of persons in the medical purposes of the marihuana and will pursue illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The prosecutor of Wald in North Colorado, Ken Bak, represents a stronger approach to this issue.
After voting on the legislative project, he stated that the prosecution would continue to take the responsibility for the possession of the marihuana, in particular to encourage the users to take the treatment course.
Currently, there are two and less untions of marihuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution is to pursue action which are considered criminal at the time of their consensus," said Mr. Bak in his statement.
The reaction was inequality even in areas such as the rural area where the voting participants rejected the proposal for the implementation of the marihuana.
The Grand Jankshn police, the largest city in the surrounding area, has no longer attached to the responsibility of the two-year-olds for the ownership of a small number of drugs.
The Environmental Prosecutor Peter Hutzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to submit an accusation on the already open cases of marihuana.
"I think to ensure that the law is complied with until it changes, it is our responsibility," he says.
Despite 55 per cent of the people of Colorado, participating in the vote, supported this decision, including the issues of marihuana use for times of public and legal systems will not be simple.
In contrast with the reaction of the people in different states, the unlikelity of the authorities to the experiment of the state with the marihuana.
" There is a cultural barier in the area of the prosecutors," explains Shaun, Denver, which represents the interests of the marihuana's convictions, and the representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana laws.
"They are so persecuted by people because they can't actually be humbled with that it is no crime anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which the small number of marihuanas are related to the same as alcohol is determined to be a experimental field in the country's scale to check the idea of drugs.
Participants of the implementation and official states are planning to expand the territory of the aligned trade, but they are far from the federal authorities who are still planning to consider the sale and growth of marihuana as a federal crime.
Parties of marihuana analysis hope that the Office of Justice will take place in this matter.
Despite a few, a wide range of arrests of traders and patients, the use of marihuana on medical tests, the Federal Government in most cases gave good trade in marihuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
Agencies for drugs will not be able to enter into the house to confiscate a small marihuana package, but if they will close their eyes to the regulated authorities of the recreative marihuana store, which are allowed under the new law, Kevin A. Sabbet, former drug combat adviser in the administration of Obama.
Citys in Colorado were not expected by the federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections, some of the administrative authorities have approved the morals for the opening of new marihuana sales stores that would not be able to be opened before the year.
Last week, Montrose, the city in the western part of the state, has made an examination of the sixmonth trade prohibition of marihuana, which, of course, will be approved at the weekend.
"We do not want to be in such a position that we will issue a license to someone and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have an opposite between the results of the vote and what the state has voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Peternell White: I was survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of universities for their views has not been started today.
As long as I remember, I always wanted to go to the Oxford University.
My father and elder brother learned in Oxford and described it as the best educational work in the world, the modern analogue of an anti-simpose, based on two fundamentals of civilization, freedom and tolerance.
Nevertheless, after two weeks of training at the historical university of Wooster University of Oxford at the end of the eighth century, I collected chemodeans and left what happened in the first actual scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and weep.
The friends were broken with so much.
The Evening Standard report said that I left the college because I didn't like my companions to be sexing in the neighborhood comma.
E. Norman Wilson's shot that I'm gone because I had to drink from the cockpits.
Actually, it wasn't so fun.
I'm down.
Yeah, I got down because I was systematicly scared and scared.
It's not because of my adequate name or what I learned at my private school.
Only for one reason I was disappointed, and in this glorious clue of existence, it looked like a real barbary and blind fanatism: my father, who now is quiet Woodro White, was a council of Margaret Tetcher, and I was a neighbor of conservators.
You're asking why to remember this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students with the right of views is subject to the same trail.
This institutionalised and continuing hatred to the conservators in Oxford is so much that a group of these students needed the same protection of their rights in the last week as those who were given to persons, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators from the Student Club of Corross Christy in Cambridge claim that they are "frequently actively isolated, subjected to similar attacks and caused themselves to feel unnecessary" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative in the Committee on the Rights of the College to ensure the freedom of expressing their opinion.
Their situation was only deteriorated by the recent BBC 2 documentary film on the Policy Policy in the Strana miracles: Young, Smart and Right, in which the conservators were exhibited by neonacists and neonacists.
The film showed Joe Cook, the former President of the Association of Conservators of Oxford University, who is in the Rolls Royce, carries silver costume and silver coast.
At other universities, conservator students complain that they are making "building boxes because of higher education."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Conservators of the Nottingem University, interviewed with one of the newspapers, said that "in the University Environment, a crossing at the left side of views is increased.
People who do not even know us earlier believe that we are arrogant and unjust children of rich parents."
With ́Juel Roberts, 21 years old, a student of the historical college Corros Christie College, in which a request was made for protection strength, calls such a "newful" atmosphere, and Stephanie Cheryl, 19 years old, the new President of the Conservative Association of Oxford University, says that the relationship of members of the Student Club to the rights of views has been significantly deteriorated.
"This is a threat both for the atmosphere of intellectual discussions and just for the normal life of club members," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in minority, but I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a robbery and an eighteen-year-old.
Oxford was deceived from hate to the conservative party.
In a year before that, the University was lost by voting the former student Margaret Tetcher's honourable degree because of the reduction of budgetary assets to higher education.
In such a atmosphere, even stalinists would be inappropriate.
In the first days of the first week, when students met each other and the teachers, I felt first waiting forward.
I did not know that the teachers were not just looking through their fingers on the conservators' trail, but they were also pleased to participate in it.
Political issues are the deterioration, privatization and non-governmental sanctions against the government of the apartment in the UAR - through the broad tree panels of the audience wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the 18th century to English, and I was not ready to follow it.
"Mrs. White," said the teacher, now Harry Pi's relax, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard to give me, and I was stuck.
Harry Pi was a very yellow man with a person like a torture.
"Taccherists principlely don't teach French or they just don't have enough brain?" he asked.
Other students have been safeguarded.
I had the tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few first lessons of French at free time, if you are not very busy in returning to society," Pi browsed.
I came back to my comma with a completely unfortunate.
That evening in the coldge, I was sitting behind the two, and then somebody shot me on my back.
It was James, a second course student from the English University College, who was a member of the University Conservator Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case is:
Every one who is suspicious to the conservators will be sealed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father's close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be more complicated.
The majority of primary conservators assume that they are the laborators."
Later, in the pope, I tried to submit.
I insisted that she wasn't with everything Margaret Tetcher says.
Violence failed.
The first-courser of the philosophy, politics and economics, who learned in Etone, said, "You're the daughter of the fascist sugar.
You're infected."
Other students accepted his words.
I was stumbled, crazy.
"How do conservators have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're striking each other, right?"
I felt like that the homosexualists must have felt before the abrogation of the voting persecution in the sixty years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or would I have to meet the one-monsters just under the cover of the night?
Should I be obliged to be a leborist and hide my real victories?
I had three years to look like a hell, a full persecution, and a singleness.
The only teacher in my college, without hiding his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for the pertinence of conservators but also because he was Tetcher's Adviser on External Policy and one of its sponsors.
He was almost not present in the college.
He dismissed him for the provinciality, mildness and commitment of the historic-determinist view.
In 1997, he adopted a professional post at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not happy here," he said to me.
I started to go to Oxford from the parents' house in London, trying to find a refuge between families and unprecedented stomach friends.
I told Dad that I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
All political views were taken there during his training during the fourteen years.
"But this is the best university in the world," he said grievously.
- It's not able to do that, but not in the town of shooting spices...
Even my communists' friends are always inconsistent."
His hot eyes were pushed.
"Do not make successful decisions.
I'm sure it's just a shit.
You'll break my heart if you're leaving the university."
I was disappointed by constant trains in London and my emotional protection.
My friend, as well as the conservator, did not endure pressure and refused to escape.
At the week of the seminar, when the special teacher of the story was really seriously called me "the lying of the people", I decided to do the same.
In the soul burning from shame, I recognized that my parents were moving my brains, and called them old fools.
The prehistory was a little long time.
The last wheat in my career's grave in Oxford was sentenced to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two letters every week for the publications of Rupert Merdoku.
My door was closed.
I didn't go out, and after five minutes my persecutors were delivered.
When they left, I collected the cow and set up the first road to London.
I didn't come back so much.
You can call me a plastic and a puzzle.
But in the eighteen years, no one should be an object of such evil and fear in teaching.
More importantly, it was Oxford who had not only released fourteen Prime Ministers, but is also hidden by the unworthy reputation of the University in which they appreciate freedom and freedom.
"Valentino prefers the legacy of glory"
The "Valentino: Master shittia", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other Italian designer clients
Sommerset House, former residence of the English Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital is worth accepting a statement of Valentino Garabani.
The designer recognized this during the opening of Valentino: Master shittia, a triumphal retro-exposition, which units more than 130 high-mode plates of his "house" for the last 50 years.
"I love this court," he says with his unrepeated Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only person who is "or sinor" Garabani, but it could not be written without his named customers.
Valentino always felt an amazing rare and remote world to know.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, similar letters and graphs are collected after signing the most important aristocrats, from the princess of Salima Ag-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Mari-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these similar memories as the trophes of its sum: from the modest port of Voger north Italy to the international "Elite" cover.
Being in love with the king's court is nothing wrong.
"They don't at least cut off their cigarettes about your great cover, as some pop-music stars do," says the Baronesa Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in Alpha and were good friends.
Valentino is an insane master and takes guests with kindness and niceness.
"We all liked to come in his chamber in Gstaad," explains the former wife "Hainey" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beautifuls like Marelly Anielly or the gender of Ni'os.
Valentino always prefered the legacy of glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine Model Valerie Más reminds the charity of a model.
Once we went to dinner to him home, it was after showing a mode in Spain area, a few years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy the younger.
Valentino's style was shown in every detail of his apartment, in her eating, in food, in every detail.
"Each of the guests of Valentino was making a feeling important and favorite," reminds the "to-model" work started with the model in 1995 during the High Mode Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of the mode, because his exhibitions are real experiences," she ends.
Pair of gentlemen
Haravani's life is not a story of obtainment, but a loved one with full mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Sommerset House Gallery was converted into a glamorous depth of sixty metres in the length that makes a change of role: a visitor has a place of models and has to defilate on the suburb, the "speakers" guards of the greenhouse that swimming by the cheese from Valentine, such as the payment that Jaclyn Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onosis, the costum, who split Monica Witti in the "Night", or a ballo of the chest and skin that belonged to the Fara Diba emperor.
The names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn and Taxis, Matte-Marith from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sophia Gabsburg are flashed in this model.
Nati Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is as the first love, "not forget."
I'll remember him.
These were the sticks, the rubber, the "gelet" and the jacket from the 1971-1972 winter collection.
"This was a gift he did to me," says Natti Abascal, one of the designer museums.
"I prefer him to the rest of his femaleness, his great love for women, because he underlines beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I like the colors he uses: they have many lights and they "come" to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
Princess and laws of Patricia's model act of Jovampaola Dr. Arenberg can't forget the first time she was clothing in Valentino.
When I was growing up and lived in Italy, I thought I was gonna have an age and behavior to take one of his evening toilets...
The end came that hour at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first bill from Valentino to bring it to the feast in the lock of my cousin, Prince Edward de Line.
It was a red board with a box with a box, a "corsage" in a stomach and a knife without a box.
"This was a dream that makes it manifest," says Rodrigo's widow Dr. Arenberg.
"Valentino is equivalent to mode, his ability is temporary," explains this Italian aristocratic who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess d'Arenberg keeps his feasures from the model with "maximum caution... because the payment is not just a lobster, but also a community of memories that follow him."
Mode King
The great end of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Santal Miller's wedding for her wedding with Paul in Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "children" (as called the modeler of their swimming) were required to make this set of the color of the slone bone with the incrossing of the wheat, twelve species of different circles and sleep at four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Susie Menques, the largest authority of specialized pressure, the pay is a very high mode of the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the highlight."
The "life style" of the elitis, which is now the best representative of Valentino.
The Cavaler of the Great Cross (the sign of the highest ranga in Italy), the Cavaler of work, the Commander of Experience and Diversity, recompensed by the Order of the Honorary, Garabani collected the same honor as any of his customers' husbands.
"My attention always attached his insensitiveness, his calmness, his accurate and inappropriate look," says Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a dinner at the Museum of Orse.
He was sitting at the table with Jacklin de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was uncovered, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's bigest profession: Kawah-Igene shatters
Four-four Indonesian shatters risk lives and health, putting 70 kilograms of serum to the top of the wa by crude stone troops
There are people whose work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijay, one of the 400 chiefs who win the lives of a seats in Kawah-Idgen, which is located on the east of the Indonesian island of Yawa.
Each day, Anto descends to the bottom of the cracker, where the deep gas rises from the depth of the Earth is in contact with the air.
Along with a huge serum cup that can reach 70 kg, he puts them into two bambowish waste, splits the waste on the shoulders and carries them on the top of the rocked road.
To the top of the wu, the height of 2.386 metres is only 250 metres, but the weapons need more than 40 minutes to get up to the steady step, holding the balance and the rest of our road to avoid moving and falling out of the rubber.
They know that one unfair step could cost their lives, as happened to one of the French tourists, who had been broken a few years ago from the Kawah-Idjan rock.
Kawah-Idgin's chiefs win 5 cents per kilogram of serum
On the top, they put themselves on the way between tourists who are graphing them, as if they were obscured from the circle, and they were weakened by the height of three kilometers to the weights that the higher company has fixed as far as 1,850 meters.
Speaking and speech about the CAT Candy Ngrimby, companies that have exploited this volcan since 1960 and, better and not to say, its architects, which it will have 662 Indonesian rupes (5%) for each kilogram of serum.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupes (83 percent) to petroleum productions, since this mineral is distributed throughout the world and is used to produce sockets, feeds, cosmetics, dynamites, and even sugar.
"So as the standard is a transfer of 70 pounds, we work about 46,000 rupes (3.8%) for each step," explains Anto, which usually performs three daily transfers.
He's spent three hours for each of them and finally feels disrupted, but they allow him to buy 138.000 rubber (11.5%) to the end of the day.
Although it is a missionary for such unfair efforts, it is three more than he would have worked in the field.
"The payment to the chickens is very high in the case of coffee collection of 15,000 rupes on the day and a middlemonth of two million rupes (167%)," explains the carrier who had previously worked as a tourist on the Bali Island.
His payment was 75,000 rupse (6,2°) on the day and part was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banguiwanga, a city near the wu, for a reason that in Indonesia is the same coincidence as the seara: "I married Bali, where some induists were, and brought it to Yava to accept it."
Anto astma, he breathes with hardness, keeps halting, and he has eyes down because of gases.
At its 27-years, Anto has spent three years, risking in Kawah-Idjan, which has already started to refer to it despite the mask and special eye.
He has a astma, he breathes with hardness, continually breathes, and his eyes will be laughed because of vulcanal gases.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his pleasure.
"I have two years later because I want to open the store or study the Spanish or French," he promises more than acceptable English.
This nice and wise young man could be a tourist, officer or potter in the hotel, but instead he performs mula.
By dividing the wooden pig with other wearers, it rises every day at two hours of night, because the serum doesn't stop running the night when its character yellow color is converted into a cloud and flashes between darkness.
Antoe is going down to the crater by shadow, lighting the way by a small fountain, subsequent to his cascade, which he himself bought for his money.
Approximately 400 cartridges taste the cartridge with serum on their shoulders from the bottom of the wu
Despite high income, the coastal company does not have a mechanism for the acquisition of cost economy and does not provide any equipment to the mediators who are working for their accounts and with such imprisonments.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 300,000 rupes (2.5%) of the collection of a feet, which, in addition to the entry ticket for 15.000 rupes (1.2%), takes the guardians of this commander from tourists coming to photograph the vulcan and its people-mules.
"This work for cattle, not for humans," states the 42-year-old 42-year-old Badrusin, who has been conducted at Kawah-Idjan for three decades, from the way the college left.
The one who rises up to 110 kilograms, assures that he will endure - "as much as he can" because he needs money for the education of his three children at age 18 to 10.
I'm not going to the pension, I'll die here because the vulcan is my whole life.
Although sherry burns the hair and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and captures the winds in the fleshly pillars of smoke, they are so exciting that no one regrets its serious diseases... more serious, obviously than their habitual problems with breathing, arthrosis, knees and wounds on the backs that were deformed under the difficulty of the waste.
With the balance of the waste on the shoulder, Uninic can now only rise 50 kg in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions take 15 tons of serum from wu ́na, which three carriers transport to stock to Thamansari, over 18 miles [18 km] by the floor of the troop among adults.
"I'm not going to a pension, I'll die here because the vulcan is my whole life," Unanik says, "which opens the mouth that doesn't have enough teeth.
From his five children, the elder, 30 years old, also works as a serum transferer.
It is time to pass, but poverty always increases from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what the Kawah-Idgin mules are doing.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singapores are accused of carrying, stress and prices for jealousy and education in the lack of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a Patriot husband, you're my wife's patriot, we'll do our civilian and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the publicity of a mad bowl, but despite that, or maybe by this, this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are a part of the rape that uses the talks like "Look the bao (bulk) into the sand" to smile over the level of birthability in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, has hoped that they would be able to gain attention to this problem in a distressing form.
His Creator Director, Duglas Gamilton, says that he wanted to exercise the power of humans to carry out "their national".
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of ourselves, so we feel that it is the theme we need to take.
We knew that the Government tried to do many things, for example, to acquire spirits with the pheromons or to organize the festivals of quick knowledge (bliz-shows).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but unlawful.
So we thought why we should not do the most creative thing of the → to solve this problem, namely to create a rep?
1.2 Children
Who doesn't understand this so easy, this is the Government of Singapore.
It takes $1.300 per year to promote citizens for a greater number of children.
The State packaging for marriage couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends the vacation and generations and guarantees tax debt.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-technological city in South-Eastern Asia, also the conservation of its leadership and its strict public control.
The level of birthability in Singapore, which is its national population management, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2, which was a percentage of replacement in 1976.
So why do the singapores not have more children?
Than Way Min, Director of the Country Policy Department and Family of the National Government of People's People's People's People's People's People's Policy, says that the cause of "the improved education" and "the widest range of careers".
"This has allowed people to have a wide range of options in the case of life's objectives and priorities, other than marriage and family creation," she explains.
These changes of standards contribute to the increase in the number of holidays and laying up marriages and children's birth, thus reduced birthability levels in Singapore.
However, the immigration policy aimed at a rare increase in immigration to resist the decrease of the population causes force among the population.
Singapore has web sites where the food of hidden xenophobia is flowing towards many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who criticize the support of low-level payments and the disapproval of integration.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the Governing Party of Singapore has received the worst results of elections from the time of independence last year.
After elections, it was attempting to solve the problem, with the support of the quota and higher taxes for foreign slaves.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of birth has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax income, medical and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected effects.
The Government strives to avoid building such a small greenhouse.
For example, this began to affect the inmobility sector.
Ru's urban development has been controlled by the number of small apartments that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold by 46 square meters.
Yet, there is a view that they can contribute to the cold lifestyle and only stimulate those who want to build a large family jealousy.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the Home Company EL ́ers, says that their "combustible boxes" are sold much faster than more space exemplars.
They are more popular, in the meaning that such apartments are solved for a few days, even weeks, faster than the apartments of greater size.
As a result, our daily income is increased.
However, he recognises that new standards provide more clear orientations for the holders who had previously offered suggestions if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city of government.
Although these new rules may be a step towards enhancement of national birthability, after having been with syngapurs working in the financial quarter of the centre, they will not have any effect.
"The people are very stressed, the dear yellow, as well as the education, and therefore many people reject it," says the young manager.
Others can have children.
"But it is important for me to have your own money and time," says another 20 years old young man.
Men and women mention their career, stress, and prices on yellow and education as reasons for taking children.
Thus, whatever the Government tries to encourage its citizens to be born, including the detailed detail, the last word remains behind the Singapores.
Personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish, the statement and the property of the private or the " privacy area which have the right to protect from any intention."
What is similar to the 16 - year - old younger?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in its networks?
Does he understand the dangers to be subject to the discussion on the Internet of situations that would probably not have been shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five guys from ten to 15 years of age, often network users.
In four cases, they associate the term with " something very myself" in personal area and "password and username" when it was applied to networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't get in post," says decades, when he's trying to explain the importance of personality on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years of account.
"This is very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he acknowledges.
I'm threatening nice pictures or pictures of the game.
I'm also enjoying my friends.
"I wouldn't share a graphy which is not mine, or someone who feels stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to acquire inappropriate graphs of defected persons, crimes, or to write about the distress or angry comments.
He's sure he knows 35 friends in the FBI, and nine of his floors in Twitter.
Most of them are family members.
She has a password for one of the accounts.
I commanded Twitter to express myself and write interesting twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just threatening them," he adds.
"Society of the network -- once I can talk to remote families or to my friends fast," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
It would not be considered with someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The 14-year-old Hose is different.
This growth has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and lastly admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friend list.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one had inclined his confidence and asked his home address or phone number.
"If you have to press me or ask me, I will only remove them from my account," he admits.
Hose's follower Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy doesn't have a strange experience of what it's like kibermobing today.
One of my friends knowing the hongage in a network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't know who he was," he assured.
Girtva, according to Hose, did not remove the account.
"Only involved confidentiality."
He then explains the consequences of steps to set up the account in a safe manner.
In contrast to Horke, this boy would carry out the figures of those known in inappropriate or confusional situations.
Yeah, I would do that if I don't like someone or if I want it.
"I want to know that it's kibermobing," he confirms.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and teacher for education and education, believes that to guide children and adults, it is necessary to understand that the objective of networks is to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a means to search for information, but the game rules were changed with the presentation of these sites," she noted.
Perras indicates that Mark Prenski, the pedagogic actor from the Yeel University and the worker of the Digital Aborigens and Immigrants, has acquired these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital aborigines are they, children and youths who were born in the time of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are learning ourselves," she says.
It explains that this subject is complicated, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what you can, or to spread, or to speak, in age when adulthood is not enough for it."
"So that they are selective, while the most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to demonstrate confidentiality to employment and growth is to ask questions that cause them to think.
"Speak to them that they do not do this," she adds.
Then, Porras recalls some options: there are things you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like that if you'd have a picture of you like what you've told about your friend?
Do you know that others are talking about you?
When you sign the holiday graphs, do you ask for permissions from others to note them?
Anything else, should everyone know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to give them understanding that they have to be conducted online as they do this offline.
The rules are the same.
"The Internet is a man who is with respect, responsibility and other principles, so must be in the networks," she acknowledges.
Carefulness
Stuardo Guardia, University Teacher, Initial Education Professor and Education Advisor, explains the need for family heads to read the network policies well-consciously.
In understanding each of the items, they have good communications with children about the proposals for the opening of the accounts on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to be distributed or distributed," he says.
According to Howdy, the key question is to remind the lesson "not talk to strangers".
The UNSUR Sammit ends without the finding of the Lime Declaration
VI The presidential summit of the South American Nations Union (UNASUR) has been completed today in Peru without discovering the Lime Declaration announced in the previous and theoretically signed family of participants.
The Efe tried to get access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the Government of States and Governments, but the sources of the Chairman and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transferred after closing, but then confirmed that it would be repeated on the Peru Government ' s website at a certain time.
The issues of the text indicated that the content was expressed by President Peru, Olyanta Umala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Sammit was always available.
There was only translation in the press room, video of the presidential assembly without sound with the message "Closed here, prohibited".
A few information between reporters was transmitted by press secretaries of some UNSUR governments, present at the meeting, but not from Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of the presidents involved, which caused the failure of hundreds of journalists from various national and medium-smiths who requested more information.
Afterwards, the President's administration sent an e-mail MMI with the "final declaration" of the summit, but not the official document that the summit had completed.
In October last, Peru adopted the III Sammit of South America and Arab countries (A > A), and at that time, despite that it was sustainablely required of the press, the Limean Declaration, which were previously announced, was also not distributed.
On the Official Website A, it can be checked that the document was repeated last Tuesday.
At both meetings, the Peruan authorities were attempted to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but the information was maximized.
The Sammit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the Court of Justice of Gaga, which regulates territorial terms between both countries.
Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala and Chili, Sebastian Pinner, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court, which begins to hear the statements of both parties in Gaague in the framework of the accusation that Lima had made against Santiago on Monday.
"We will keep and comply with the decision that will explain the differences we present in this court," said Omala, near its Chilean colleague.
"Chile was, eating, and being a country concerned with international law, peaceful solution to divisions, covenants and courts," added Pinner, and welcomed Umalu's hands on the background of the flags of these two countries.
Subject to both Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court, Colombia had protested the Godotic Pacte on this week, which it had recognized that it would be subject to the verdicts of this international court after the decision on the marine borders with Ni’gua, which she felt misunderstanding.
Sammit was disabled by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been arrested since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for the opening of the discussions tomorrow and for the closing of the Sammit, almost after half of the time of Limma.
The Chairman of the State read the final document in which it reported that 16 agreements were adopted and had a 31-year-year-year-year project, which amounted to investment was $17 billion.
Among the agreed agreements he mentioned that UNASUR countries will "make important steps for the purpose of the South American citizenship, for which we extend the agreements on residence".
He reported that measures were taken to improve " cooperation in combating citizens ' uncertainty and organised transnational crimes, to increase the access to medicinal products, to improper access to the Internet in all corners of South America and to take into account the total and effective risks of natural disasters".
Since the crisis is, "the economic unit (Latin America) should not have a triumphatoral basis, but should serve to enlarge our productive basis and to predict the best future for our cities," Umala added.
"We decided to give privileges to the group of 31 signic projects that would improve the areas of South America, especially in the village and border zones... to enlarge our countries and develop new economic schemes," said the Peruan President in the reading message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are related to Peru, and they are packed by the opposite axes in its territory, from age to Brazil, and two are aimed at a large relationship with Ecuador, but it is not a longer detail.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its repeated accession to the Union of South America's nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of welfare and peace would be unified and had good relationships between the neighbors was another theme underlined on the same.
In this regard, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his colleague from Ni­gua, Daniel Ortegoy, on the Sabbath in Mexico for negotiations in respectful form of marine situation as a result of the verdict of the International Court sent by God.
"Post morning (Saturday), maybe meet President Daniel Orthoo," said Santos.
"Let us examine all these ways, and they are not mutually exclusive, including the Pacific with Nigua will need discussions with Ni’gua," he stressed.
"The President of Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this most civilised and respectful way," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on the Sabbath in Mexico, where they have been presented to enter the new president of this country, Enrique Paña Newto.
The Defence Defence Ministers also met for the 2013 Plan to strengthen the dialogue and singleness of the region.
Argene, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the last part of the countries has been stopped.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America must learn from citizenship integration": Rafael Correo
President Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of the general citizenship is a goal for the "South America, in this case, to learn from the Property".
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential meeting of the South American Nations Union (UNASUR) held in Lima, stated to Peru's public television that the peers were " murdered one another during the Second World War" and "at the same time, they are almost one of them."
He protected, in this context, the draft establishment of South America ' s citizenship, which approves UNASUR countries.
"The free movement of citizens and slaves in any South America country, as it is already happening to the members of the Indian community, but yet there are reaction sectors that want us to return in the past," he warned.
The Ecuador Chairman has also shown himself as a part of the renewal of the United States of the United States (OGA) under the proposal of reducing the impact of the English Saxon States and accepting the attention of those who signed the San Hose Pakt on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons will never take any obligations, but we, the South Americans, sign everything.
"It is not explained that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is affected by the United States," he claimed to the political refuge given by the Ecuador basic WikiLeaks, Julian Assanju.
Corea assured that he did not regret the decision because he had not delivered his principles with him but kept his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at its time " there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extracted into the third country and that the process would not be observed."
Furthermore, the Swedish justice for the request to come to its territory for a case-subject crime, while "the Swedish law only considers that it would be able to be done through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuador advocacy in London."
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of injury of the physical and mental health of Assanja.
"I didn't talk to him about how he came to our office, but the employee told me that he had a small problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador Chairman of the State.
What it is actually, this is the danger of deteriorating its physical and mental health because of a small space without the possibility of exercising air.
"This affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the issue of refuge delivered by Assanju from June in the Equatorial Assembly in London, by providing an incompatibility guarantee that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Peace Court Boards and stressed that there were negotiations in London on the solution to the question of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not conduct negotiations on human rights, this word we are not using in this case, but have been continuous discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Peeking Court Bodies, because Assanaja, Balthasar Garson, has a number of processes at various Peese institutions," he mentioned.
And he said, "If the United Kingdom will give tomorrow a guarantee of independence, it will be finished."
And if Sweden, as she allows her legislation and as she has already done in other cases, will ask Senior Assanja at Ecuador in London or ask him for Skype tomorrow, this problem will be resolved.
Correa was encouraged to show himself as a protector of print freedom and stressed that he did not endure "protections, no consciousness and lies that distorted the freedom of expression".
"The main enemy of the freedom of printing is not the deceased politicians, but the bad journalists supporting life, honesty and requirement," he said.
In this regard, he remained sufficient that neither those journalists, "no bankiers nor burrowing hemoon countries are not in Ecuador", and added that, being re-educated, "the revolution will be deep for the continuation of development in the right direction".
Corea also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's wind to UNASUR at least before elections, arguing that " must be firm and not sustainable to the opportunism and support of mass legislation," because "they actually distorted the law of Paraguay Democracy."
In addition, the Ecuador Chairman considered that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos would now take negotiations with Nigthua on the border between two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of Gaagia, which had been benefited from the Guyana Maritime Sovereignty.
This decision is currently not complied with.
This is the issue between South America and Central America.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
Their community must be treated to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good end of the marine border, which leads to the same court of Peru and Chili, and said that "the Latin America is right to address the institution if two countries are committed to make a decision which would be difficult."
As a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador to be voted for the third time, he pointed out that he considers this "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost elections in February 2013, he was from public life.
I have never been interested in the authority in my personal way, but in wrong situations such as in Ecuador, the poverty of economic poverty can be addressed only by political authority.
"My political movement believed that I guaranteed this probably victory, so that it should be recognized that responsibility," he said.
In the case of a victory, this would be my last time at the president's position, and then we will be out of the public life.
If we lose it, it's the same thing.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new course of treatment of the Vanessael President Ugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President Nikolas Maduro of Venezuela, who told me that he had gone to the treatment already planned, and that it was expected to lose the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the state of the health of President Chavez," he explained.
The Chairman of the Equatorial State has participated in Lima today in the sixth heads of States and Governments of the United States of South America (UNASUR), which has ended with calls for a greater regional integration to maintain progress, security and progress.
Mortality of IDA today is the result of the outer diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that it was a positive result in its analysis on the ID.
"I'm as if I'm disappointed," he recalls that difficult, despite all such a doctor, a moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to cope with sickness, he wanted to learn about it as far as possible, and his efforts were justified - he already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricio is one of the "old" patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara hospital Hospital (HCG), where he entered in 1994, and there were no obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) already 22 years, which would be difficult to believe that at the beginning of the 90s, too little, the treatment options were too few about the disease, too addicted to the disease.
Well, even the clinical director of the Me'kan Institute of Protection did not wish to forgive him "for he had a burden."
In other words, there was a sentence at that time.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it without a damaging quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing their disease, many people come to this couple when the virus has already affected their immune system and they suffer from opportunist infections.
After 31 years of the world ' s development of AIDS, at least after the first stated cases, "the greater achievement for the present is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment at time and the survival of the general population is the same," said the HCG HCG, Hayme Andrade Wilyanua, chapter, with a view to the fact that this information is undertaken in the April of this year in a practical scientific issue.
The HIV/AIDS infectionist and expert, Andrew Wilyanua, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that the IID is not a condemnation, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of the immun system of patients at the start of diagnosis, with the best expected duration of life in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when reported about 500 CD4.
Furthermore, the abovemember means that a person who receives HIV-local diagnosis at age 25 years of age, "with the support of control, will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," he explained.
In order to evaluate this progress, it should be remembered that the livelihood of the ends today is average of 76 years.
Although the decrease was significantly decreased in the past years, in the case of Me'ka, the number of people who died from IDA was decreased from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual UNAIDS report) and that 60 per cent of patients in the national database were dead since the IDA occurred.
Only in Calisco, 255 people died in 2011, and have already been registered 187 until May this year; however, it states that there is a total access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
- Why is there so much outcome until this pool?
- I personally think the problem is not accessible to treatment.
So I imagine that, so there's cases in our hospital.
As we have not been missing medicals at least in the past 12 years, the problem is that patients are coming very quietly because they don't know their infected state, which is at the outer stages of disease.
He reported: "The nine of the ten patients are coming when they already have an opportunistic infection; what is needed to be done in order to show greater impact on the general ability, so that they are diagnosticed at the early stage, and therefore they need to provide tests for mass discovery for all people who will ask it."
In their proposal, the Specialist and Executives of the State Council on the Profile of IDA in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the same patients, such as the Fabricio, who was focused on checking in a private laboratory, which only encouraged him to do so and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of IDA and even suffered by the sarcomatic Caposhi, a cancer bullet, which is one of the spread complexities.
Everything changes when you know what you have.
They think they're dead, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'm still dead, I'll get three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are changes, I'm eating, I'm practicing, I'm taking medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he has transferred cancer.
I'm a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of busy, I travel, I have a active sex life, but with both responsibilities, I care about myself and another person," the Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to move his statement to those who now, in the context of the World Day of Conflict with IDE, experience fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know whether they are HIV-local and better, and if they already have diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person, being responsible.
This is its message that resumes the subject of combating ≥IDA in 2012.
Reserve after adjunction
The great disasters between health programmes and a simple citizen, Richard Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who was a problem with HIV.
And the biggest is the profile.
In places in which this task is dedicated, "the distribution of preservates has actually increased, one or two of us had already given us, now we have a hundred packages, and this is very good, but it is evident that there are those who do not have access to the preservation until now," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adults.
"Why are they to you?" The Pope was a question, with equity and conviction, by school advisers, aptex and health careers, which did not want to hear adults, assured a propaganda.
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that the preservatives not only be behind the travellers and that a hundred of them be located in public trains in places that often visit young people.
It's not a promotion of disappointment.
Not on the payment of beer and motel, the Governor Emily Gonzáles answered when he was asked whether there was a preservate delivery on his leadership.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to make preservatives available to those who are already sexually active," he noted.
Key data in Halisco
13.435 summary cases were registered (12.158 IDA and 1.317 HIV).
The State has the fourth place in the national assessment for new and summary cases of HIV and 13th.
92 per cent of infections are related to halfway, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to perinal path.
Assessedly, 50,000 people can live with HIV, since for one case, there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Having regard to the war by the United States Appeal Court of Justice, which cancels the Resttouris Group of Vitro, by means of the competitive production in Me'ka, the scenario sets a rock-precedent for any national branch company in the neighborhood who has a problem with payment.
It seems that the procedures for surviving firms which are under the Canadian laws are not being held in the country of sex and stars, contrary to agreements.
In the area of the approving the decision made by Judge Harlin Hail on June 15, in the Court of Justice of the Northern Texas, remains the unsecure firms before the possibility of arresting their property from Rio Grande.
However, the establishment opens the door to the leading producer of glass in Me’ca for the treatment of the United States Supreme Court, providing three failures.
As an entry, while the case judge notes that the United States Financial Code should be regulated by the Apelation Court of the Fifth Circle held in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is to be covered by the competitive production considered in Me'ca.
The first item underneaths the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational profile undertakings.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Standard Law on the Right of International Trade was established by determining the American Rights Institute as an arbitr.
Second, the verdict sets out that without interim vote recognised in the critical mass of the competitive production of debt, which had before Vitro's mother's branch company, there would be no majority necessary for restoration.
However, this opportunity is recognised by the laws of the Canadian.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme was adopted.
There are a half of examples including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-firmary guarantees are the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that the vote of the branch offices, whether or not, of the creditors of Vitro who were against him in the United States courts, namely the "foreigners" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached most.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are released by the Appeal Court.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation in which it has occurred since 2008, with a serious economic crisis, which has reached the United States, has been attacked by the country.
As long as the family company of Gonzáles Sad will make a complaint to the Court of Appeal that the vote will come to his captivity, that is, five judges, because the vote is only three.
In the case of a failure, a certification procedure will be reported that requires a review of the procedure by the Court of High Instance, in this case by the High Court of the United States.
It is worse that the Court has rejected the document addressed by the Government of Me ́ka in the role of friendus curiae (" Second Court"), in which the procedure for Vitro under the Competition Law, signaling that it is free of compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Article 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country was subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, namely the rules set out in cases of intergovernmental non-payment, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambal from two boards: they struggle in Vitro and struggle in the country.
General balance
Having regard to a few months of complaints located on the table by the Mexican de Aviation against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of the board, has already found a bottleboat by the Professional Association of Aviators.
The Institute held by Carlos Dias Chaves Morino has just requested a vote against the National Bank and Value Paper Commission, which is accused of prevention of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority was systematicly refused to provide reports in the General Procurement of the Kasatic Operation, which was carried out by the undertaking of the IXE Bank F/589 trust fund, 198 million peso, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be addressed to purchase shares of the Professional Officer of Hotels.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main actor of the islands of Posadas.
Round Dragon Mart
At the forum at the Caribbean University, the group of ecological and forests, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the establishment of a broad front for the opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancuna.
We speak, as you know, about the huge sales and distribution center in Me'ku, Central America and the Caribbean Base Production of a isolated country, with a area nearby for 150 companies.
Canacintra has earlier been able to join the Governors of the south-east area to resist monumental forces that have led to parts of protected territory and have severe threats to the industry.
Death
The Cass rejected Government of the Senate's request to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Me Me Manufacturer in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Contrast, which is as an abbreviation in English, which has already been passed by Me's Industry Institute.
As you know, it has been done, despite the self-disqualific senate, the possibility of considering it as a deteriorating freedom of expression in the networks.
Homex in long-term
In pursuing long-term debts, without a short-term impact, the Homex shipholder places the Certificates for 500 million peso on the market.
The exemption is the first of the four identical, with a proposal for payment of percent every 28 days.

Educated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders of in-technologies, Consortium with trade named Competival, it will be the market for programming services in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1,5 billion.
Heather Heather Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Heather Heatin Reise was more than 60 years old with this, and through him the world was overwhelmed.
A few people in Puerto Rico keep in memory so many basketball stories as Heather Reyes.
Before the blood exhaustion in the brain was brought to the invalid cup in 2008, Rayes was insighted in sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the High Basketball Ligue, a powerful and ruling BSN with Cowboy Bajamon and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in the basketball during my life, including a few at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during the visit of Primera Hora to him in Bajamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exhaust by doing this in the existence.
The walls of his house, almost all ornaments and memory things that are made on his way, testify about it.
Bajamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through the Coboy, starting from the middle of the 50ths as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his statement was fulfilled in the role of a co-agent or contract agent.
"There were my best years I enjoyed most of all because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Coboy campaigns since 1967 as a agent, a co-agente, or a ru-agent.
There were many years of joy, including five campaigns spent from 1971 to 1975.
And then I was dealing with one in 1981, in the year of Jerom Mincy's debut at BSN.
From now on, the "Cookie" Ortis, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember that Jin Bart, who was here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingh), said to me, "I have a very acquainted player for you with 6'7."
"Do you want?"
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Barthus then recommended the Sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and one of our best bombers.
I remember what I said if Mincy had brought Bajamon's campaign, Gauss would have helped to win another.
I enjoyed the Cobbows campaign with Gauss, but I was already remote because it was a federal leader in 1988.
At that time, I prefered to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national assembly.
I remember how we wined the first time in the United States during the Olympian tournament of Me'ca in 1989.
Then the Championat of the world in 1990, in which we received the fourth place, and that should be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge who wanted us to play a final game, said Reyes.
That team from the World Champion in 1990 is the best collection you ever saw?
She's among the best as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the Olympics games in 2004.
But my favorite was that from the Panama-American games in Cuba in 1991 when we won gold and split the United States collection that was quite like the one we had a bronze on the world campaign.
In that team, Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopes and Piculina were played not only again, but also young (Havier) 'Colon and James Carter, Brother Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who could not participate in 90 years because of a tribe.
The order, which may not have been the best in the personal construction plan, but brought us a golden medal and great joy, was the Olympian tourist team of 1995 in Neuken, Argene.
With the role players like Canito News, Paulo Alisea and the young Rolando Huruitner, instead of players temporarily removed for unfold in the Panama campaign Mar-del-Plat, we won gold despite all the predicts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, this was Piculin Ortis.
His indicators are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico doesn't have a dominion at this level as Piculin did.
And it's without accounting his career in the different lines in which he played.
Who was the best portorican ru?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young boy, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think of your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious period of the national collection between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 90s of the BSN was up to 17 teams at the season.
What's left with you?
There were things I wanted to make, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the boys in Ponce should play only in their area and only against other parts of the island in national play-offs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the results of the commitment of a series and the course for managers, officers and judges.
That's a lot of pleasure to me.
What are you doing now?
Moreover, I'm listening, looking at a video of my time at YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren, and I'm going to the basketball.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife, Icabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman's death
Larry Haggman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Warte (Texas), worldwide thanks to his main role as John Ross Young, more strictly than J.R., in the Dallas teleserial, in which he was engaged without principles, bad and manipulating business.
Larry Hagman, whose role of Jay Ar Young's oil officer in Dallas' television in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Haggman, who returned to this year as J.R. at the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening because of the difficulties caused by cancer, a family statement provided for by the Warner Bros., the Dallas production study.
"Larry returned to her favorite Dallas, again playing a symbolic role that he most liked," his family said.
The Larry family and the closest friends were with him in Dallas on the lake on the Day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the Sixwell, was near Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, said to her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He gave joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, pleasant, pleasant, and talentably, and I'll be very disappointed by him.
"He was a original person and lived a whole life," Grey confirmed in the statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with the cirrosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, it was found a misconduct in the wild, and he transferred the transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman received television through the role of the radio type in the "I Dream of Jeannie", translated by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut, whose life changes when he meet the barbara Iden attracted, and begins to live with her under one cup.
He was also the main person of two commodities that were rarely present in the Epher, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Heere We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles that were well accepted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But his master interpretation of J.R. led Hagmen to the top of glory.
The dramatic CBS channel serial on Young and other staff in its surroundings went in Ether from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot in J.R.?", behind the creation of noise around the episode, full of emotions in which Hagmen's person almost killed, has brought a discussion and millions of dollars risked in the bookmaker offices.
This also helped the record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in the event from November 1980, in average 41 million telas were looking at it and converting Dallas into the second number of reviews, he broke the program in the history, after the end of the MASH in 1983, with 50 million viewers.
It was the concubine of J.R., Christine (in fulfillment of Mary Crosby), who shot in it.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened her that she would be accused of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack it.
Hagman played Yuing as an unfaithful corruption with a harrisy with a laughing: an unfair business and an unfair husband who wanted his wife to be a alcoholic wife, Sue Elen (Lida Gray), to be treated.
"I know that it must be on the J.R buried floor," Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Yuing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the heroin of the original series, reminded Hagman's on Friday as someone "great, both on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unrememberable for millions of people around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who has been happy to know and love him.
Ten new events of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season have already been completed and the sixth was in production, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements of what will be with the series after Haggman's release.
Fort Wart, Texas, was the son of the actor and song of Mary Martin, who was brilliant in classic productions such as "South" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still growing when she was born in 1931 during her marriage with Ben Hagman.
He tried happiness at New York's theater scenes at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the United States of England from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met the young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many people live.
In 2001 he called his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything that would be able to cause any pain or to affect them anyway," said Prensa Asociada at that time.
After the transfer, he was born to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experienced fear.
"I give them advice, add them courage, meet them when they go to the operation, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "no fear, it'll be a little inappropriate for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also acted actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course is starting to investigate "The End of the Light"
Each week, students are studying appocalyptic events such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when the Professor of the Religion Stuart Charme decided to read the course about the end of the light, he knew that he had an unexpected advice: the end of the "long back account" calendar of May, 21 December, for which many people were captured as a proof of the end of the light.
But Charme did not understand what he expected in the next few months: the catastrophe Uragan Sandy, the financial crisis, which some called "langgareddon" and the conflict in Israel, where Christian theoretes of the end of the time believe that Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic seame of all," Charme said to students of the University of Rutherns-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If we examine what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was really a good period.
And remember that it's bad for those who have an apocalyptic form of thoughts.
And he's not the only professor who's putting the courses on the "fine of the light" subject in this semester, the theoretically the last of the history.
At the Temple University, Professor Barry Waker reads the "Mediums for Mass Information, Culture and End of the World".
Each week, students are studying the apocalyptic subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spread with time," he said, and how hypotetic scenarios cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can be devastated.
This month, students analysis of the films on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they relate to real life examples.
"I tried to tell students about the possibility of probably not likely to be likely," said Waker.
In the main campus of the University of Pen, Professor of Latin America's history, Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of the history of experience and anthology, were united to read the course that is just called "The End of the Light".
"We do not add '2012 ' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the light does not end," Restall said.
Despite the "reverse distortion", students should learn, prepare projects and provide outcome tests.
At Penn State, the final examination will be taken to Apocalypse’s canon, which will not remain to students of another choice except to work "to the same night in which the end of the light will promptly end," Restall said.
The curses were adequately popular.
"The towns ended in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average ball, which was recorded at 35 students.
We received reports on e-mail for many weeks before the beginning of the seminar from people who asked whether there was more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like watching what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridget Robinson, 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutherford Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thinking, worldly or religious, is only the question of comfort or lack of it.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old psychology student and sister's business, said he was looking at all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of the course that would teach it," he noted.
I like him.
But none of the forbidden students - no longer talking about the Professor - said he believed at the date of the end of 21 December.
"Our first project affected May's prophecy, and in some way we discreded it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the last course at the Temple University of West Chester.
May never predicted the end of the light; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in the west culture, which includes a few centuries in which people react to change around themselves predicting the end of the world.
The Internet called an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Preferred in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of the University of La Sal, who teaches the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knows any course about the "End of the Light" there.
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, insisting on the advanced institution.
We have mercy from Pa.
Restall noted that during a long time, there was many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, " people will begin to think about the date" or philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are safely related to this date.
They said they were going to go to the "End of the light".
"I may call someone of my friends to laugh together," is Samir Ford's 20-year-old student of the community faculty.
