Triunph of the population in Austria, together form 29%
The elections forward to the Austrian Parliament have brought the first approximate results, a lasting debilitation of both parties of the large coalition and a explicit strengthening of the party of popularity.
A strong and special loss has been suffered by the Austrian Popular Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is serious.
Instead, the leader of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZO), the leader of the Government of the State of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares its triumphal return to national policy.
Concerning the results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of votes, so he loses 5.5 per cent of vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
The worst has still ended the OVP that loses 25.6 per cent, nearly nine per cent of votes.
It is the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two large Austrian partys since the war, and especially for the people who called these previous elections.
On the beginning of July, when the OVP was out of the coalition, the populars had a significant advantage in the preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for allowing the Government to ship.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have been heard about the dismission of the President of the party and, even today, `canciller, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this Monday can be achieved in the chairmanship of the party.
This evolution would obviously facilitate the way of the constant and closest point of department of electoral results, namely the renewal of the large coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the refusal of both of the population party - the liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, 11 per cent of the votes - and that the social democrats have expressed their fear of repeating the same in 1999 when the people negotiated with the peoples (only FPO was a unit, but in 2005 the BZO) for a coalition Government that had come to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution, Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he has already taken his flight to Vienna, the national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach the Parliament even though it has lost quickly and descended from the third to the fifth place between the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of four percent, and therefore, not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cold
If it is not possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused of collecting illegally scarbads in India, it could have reached a frozening of the Czech-Indian relations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg.
This showed the Minister in New York, after meeting today with his Indian homolog Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be resolved then yes, then it would be safe to this refrigeration," she observed after the organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive could hardly be placed.
However, he showed that in the case of Petr Svácha, who was excluded from accusation and punished with a complaint, the Government can negotiate with Darjiling's local government in which the matter is concerned.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
For Emil Kuchera, condemned to three years of prison, it would be best, See Mukherjee, which would call on the highest instances.
Then you can ask for the exoneration of the cause and wait freely for the sentence, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague was expressed in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to call on the Supreme Court and then it would be possible the indulgence," said Chef of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter into the matter is by providing the sentence a "legal competent support" by the Indian Minister.
On the other hand, he said that such a type of support is already obtained by the Indian party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as TCHK said, before her colleague, it insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really think of a tremendous mistake to prison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The Minister expressed the answer to the question of whether the Indian party had received the promise that he would take care of the matter.
"I've received a lot of promises," he just found.
A Czech arbitrates a fight in the sea fund
I'm close to a wall map, which represents the round sea.
However, the continent is not interested, but a small lost point in the ocean.
"The island belongs to the island and with it also the marine fund that rounds around it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean Rights and Sea Affairs.
Your Chief, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and, sometimes, complete.
Governs this talenter and enthusiasm of work.
The marine background hides even today a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum and other mineral primary materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to today who carry out the key for the development of drugs against cancer.
The background is greater than the firm earth
Coast countries have beginning today to discuss the new territory under the sea strictly.
The United Nations Treaty is used by the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally the named Continent Borde, which sometimes extends to a few hundred miles from the coast of the country.
This has rights in all the resources of the Continental Border.
"Singlely, by Continent Borde, the part of the marine background and its surface, which is natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the border of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of sea, which is a clean economic area, explains Mikulka.
The request submitted to the Commission for the delimitation of the external border of the continent should be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organise a technical and legal assistance committee.
The committee has yet made five requests from Russia, Brazil, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come out," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, the success of the succeed had a global impact since it was the first one that essentially enlarged its marine domination.
However, New Zealand was also obtained - the marine background surface that obtained the Commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, which is, almost six times more than the size of its own state.
Both countries have invested millions of pains for their study.
The winning that will be discovered from the use of the marine fund will, as they promise, be unvaluable.
Other states are also submitting their requests almost.
You can do it up to the ten years since they made the "Tratado de Montego Bay".
Where the continental Border ends begins the region of the Ocean Fund declared by the Treaty as "common inheritance of mankind".
Now here, no nation has a position.
The right to exploit in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The Marine Fund, however, is not any gold mine," said with emphasis by director Mikulka adding, "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its scheme defined by contract."
Czechs in the
Today, a part of the marine fund belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries from then East Block within the "Interoceanmetal" common organization.
In 1991, it was obtained by a Treaty as investors as the same as the other few states, called "the Pioner Investor".
He has an opportunity to explode in the area of ́rionClipperton in the ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to investigate by the investor is something bigger than the ancient Czech Slovakia.
The background there is accidentally, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A surface of a total halt of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploded.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion yachts containing niquel, cover, cobalt and manganese," adds the Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of concretion.
We are repeated to a small patata or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who is the legend renewed to Golem.
Liberation of rehenes the German special force command was at the place of action
In order to solve the crisis of rehenes, the Egyptian government had requested Germany's aid - experts came.
When the situation was severe, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not performed.
Each time more details are known about the circumstances of liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
The data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Internal Ministry in the Saving Action were also involved indirectly by the German special forces.
Therefore, at the place of freedom, the German army specialists and GSG 9 officers were a flight of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Research Office, as well as experts in the area of logistics of the technical beneficial institution.
As the ministers reported on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because sequestrators, given a violent release, left their prisoners and fled.
The Government of Egypt accepted Germany's aid to use it as support in the place.
"Happy not that time," said a portfolio of the Federal Ministry of the Internal Ministry.
On September 19, in the south of Egypt, the assaulters had cut off a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptians.
After the drop in the southern wilderness region of Egypt, the rehens were deported from one side to another into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the sequencers has been unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and safe people arrived to Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released rehens were under the protection of the German ambassador.
He didn't say any word about the details of the release.
At the beginning, in Berlin there was no information about their flight to Germany.
The magazine "image", 5 tourists and special forces must return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive to Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Representatives Chamber does not accept the salvation package
The first camera of the United States Congress has lacked a large safe package of 700 billion dollars for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell very drastic.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States with 227 votes against 206 the government's package for salvation on financial markets.
Despite all calls of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, the majority of the programme that should be limited in financial markets.
With a dramatic action, defensors who were desperate have still been able to convince the critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked the Members to vote, although the plan was not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones has fallen to more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concerns of investors that the state salvation package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate must be approved.
Organizators register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisers:
There is a study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the next months increased in comparison with the last year - even the winter season in more than 30 per cent.
There is a study, despite the coy, weakened desire to travel from Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, the travel agencies registered a volume of sales that was 31 per cent more in comparison with the same period of the last year.
Research from the GfK market research institution has been investigated, the reservations for the octon months have already been numbered.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was nearly 11 percent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results is GfK numbers that are the information analysed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are the travel reservations carried out until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak course of the dollar over all travels to the United States, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost a third.
The preferred destination points of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
In particular, all organised travels are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the DRV president.
Given the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are "better calculable for the customer than during a individual trip".
Inter alia, consumers can buy money with anticipated reservations or with All-Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Moreover, in the southern months, travels were well reserved, so the volume of sales in comparison with the last year went up again - although another study was the number of Germans who performed a trip, comparing the past year, was decreased.
My first feast of October
The hits of the festivals under the heaven open in the Balnear infinite, the beer in a litre's jars and the famous people dressed in traditional drafts of designers.
A start in a campaign store.
Actually, Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's ruby, moderate in television, and brings a traditional bargain to measure.
I have the dark hair, I'm a student, and my clothes are already used.
But there is one thing to us: we're just in campaign tent, the dictionarys have already passed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it's very lissionary, especially because I'm the first time in October.
That's how you make friends.
Traditional bavary bargain seems to be fulfilling his function.
In fact, as a tourist in the October festival resulting from the north of Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional bavary traces until this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Teresa Prague, it's not so much.
Almost everyone carries the traditional bavary or skin bottles; no one seems to be a case or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my frontal gets rare looks around a place station in the chocolate.
A municipality calls my attention on my front, who had dressed wrongly: "The left side is alone, half is the virgin, in the part of" is committed, behind it is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm getting back to the left.
"All right," he says laughing.
Others don't worry many of the sutil methods to flirt and carry fats where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking, their node knife.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in October.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which speaks with a "or" very long.
It tells me after I put his vessel near the side of a litre of beer that I just drinked.
He put it right on the side of the burning mouth, most of them think that it is a cube of crap.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know to drink a lot.
Others don't have much lucky and can't consume so much alcohol.
About eight of the night, health groups run on the festival and have to be concerned about poor drinks.
The sane ones appear each time in group - suddenly they are always four people who bring the walks of one campaign tent to the other.
This works as with most visitors: Come soft, return drinks.
It doesn't see who suffers the degrees of alcohol and is in the walks.
"They are those who can't be more," answered a healthy answer to my question and disappeared in tumult.
The victim of accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old peatone has been identified in the hospital after being struck by a vehicle in Essex.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, was involved in the accident in Shenfield Road on Thursday afternoon.
The woman was brought to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but she died later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the suspicion of disgusting conduct.
Since then, it has been released under confidence.
Turkey expands its diplomatic hours
So much before Turkey was trained to be a member of the European Union, the European powers were depressed by the desire to enter into this country.
In the east part of Bosnia, perhaps only 20 steps inside Asia, one of the most interesting remains of the disasterous empire ambition is found.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renasty style.
At least this is what the leaders say.
The building is placed to watch the end of the platforms and carries two towers, one for each ess, looking like a typical German assembly.
The stone is sweet.
The building in its compound is a little deep.
But once it overlooked the bullet, there is no doubt what was the size of the company that this was the westest door.
The station was incurred in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the empire game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East to ≥ this railway that was cut up to Bagdad, and further in what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, ambitions of this empire Germany failed during the First World War.
Their ferreways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular arabes.
As a result of the related isolation of the regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Friday War, it was low
the British domination and when the forces passed in Egypt, they struck the Turks and their German alien out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the Hyderpasha station also.
In 1917, a train of municipalities exploded by destroying its designed tissue.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station was falling and remaining at the margin of the history.
But today, this railway, an income gate to Anatolia and all east centres, serves at least Simulation - to highlight Turkey's will to expand its diplomatic hours.
The Party of Justice and Development - the ACP - has planned a new external policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Friday War, has disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relationships with Israel and Syria with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To appreciate the parameters of this new external policy, I went up to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, expert in the external policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of sacudides, which produced the cases of the old world in the documentary The Night Mail, I arrived to the Turkish capital - new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the Otoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear islamic roots, represents a paradigmous change in the Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspects in O ́e and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi leads me to the AKP seat, a ultramodern ≥ rock and steel - built ad hoc - in a development suburb, surrounded by average commercial centres built and "potential pastels" where business managers - men and women -- are meeting at the first hour of the morning to agree/to make business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a political of almost any party in Europe.
I brought it, honey, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the external policy of the party is to return to Turkey in its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomalie," he says.
Turkey has been cut into relations with her inside.
Today you have to look at East and West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not to one or another.
He's got to do both things.
"But certainly at some time," I ask you, "Turkey could be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "is not worrying about that choice."
Then it stresses a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken until that moment had almost recalled me of memory: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East but with the Caucas region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world towards East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returned to the two German ladies, Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who had assisted the building of this building 100 years ago.
How many would they have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will bring me back to Bosfora, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the man of Europe".
So there is no doubt that the continent to which this fascinating country must be restored.
Remembering lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (squela, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford and the Coro Philarmonic Orchestra.
As part of the musical project for the city, the next year it founded its magnetic core of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the less than 21 years, but at the time Proteus sang his end in 1979, several of us were ending the 20 - we only refused to give up to the core.
The name of "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) represented the will of the coro and the ability to execute any music present to him, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether not accompanied or with full orchest.
The musical diversity produced by this core of youths was often exciting, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that continued to be absolutely consistent for the years.
Often Tod told us to "leave music to speak for yourself."
He would say, "The comer knows what he wants.
It's all in music.
That's what you just have to sing!"
His summer was always absolutely clear and precise, even though never impositive, or too flowered.
Whatever out of the musical scratch, I always ended at a even greater level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been gentlemen, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in the Guildford Philarmonica from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by anyone – in contrast, many times have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply "sealed one or two war horses very well known around the world."
We'll miss much less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his age of William Woodruff (25 September) that "in 1946 the economic history studies were renewed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research beach... at the same time he was studying for a license title, one of mastery and one of doctorates."
This is held in a note of Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not completely correct.
Since 1946 to 1953, he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, a season, during which he completed a doctoral tesis on the British Cash industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Ruber Industry.
It spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a beach of Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to pass this part of his career, it's become unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Filology Faculty
"Recommending the exposure of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because his graphs in black and black, documental style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and strength they transmit, always treating protagonists with great respect.
A exposure that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to catch magic moments."
Second appeal for the survey of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If your pre-shower already had a broad habitation, this new monovolume presents an even larger internal space.
All of this are added to refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of carrier and allow more fuel.
Evolution in front of the revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is a very similar line to the model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
In addition, a innovative design, a new platform, larger and new mechanical dimensions should be indicated.
However, before analysing the new model, it must be said that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was introduced in the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter term than the employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and in 2008.
Exactly in Japan they have sold about a million Jazz units since they have been sold.
The second market was the old Continent, with about a half million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase the sales within the segment.
Thus, while Japanese trade signature in 2007 is a total of 83,000 Jazz units, estimates point to 100,000 cars in 2009, which would result in a growth of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation, the responsibility of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2.000 Jazz units in a full year.
Exactly the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to paliate largely the decrease of sales in Spain.
In fact, the responsibility of the mark expects to end the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in the sales of Honda, it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% of the past year.
Also, Japanese signature expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-hour hybrid and compact size - 4,37 meters of length - of which Nipona company expects to market about 200,000 units per year over the world.
By markets and the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Continent Year and Japan.
The Insight's commercialisation is planned for the first months of the year, since its presentation in society is performed in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its currency.
Its length ascends to 3.90 metres (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes to 2.50 metres, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, was not different and remained at 1.52 meters.
In addition to increased dimensions, the internal habitation also increases.
This profit, on the one hand, should be included a new platform and, on the other hand, the introduction of the fuel deposit in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Moreover, the ability of the maleter - which is related to a double fund system - reaches up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity of the maleter of the first generation.
It is necessary to note that these measures are from the version of the engine 1.4, since the capacity of the Hunda Jazz malter is 379 litres.
Other improvements - besides external elements such as back-leads or the possibility of mounting the panoramic cristal - is a improvement in access to the backplaces.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees before the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will compute with two gasoline propulsors of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that gets a smaller consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, gets excellent mechanical refining, and at the same time gets a high pair in the entire engine regime.
The first mechanical of 1.2 litres obtains a power of 90 horses to 6.000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4.900 flights.
This propulsor - which previously Jazz reached 78 horses - provides an expenditure of 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation had 83 horses, now has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses gets a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bow car' that avoids collections
To progress in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents of Nissan, it has been inspired this time in nature, in particular, in the abdomen.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of the appeals, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which provides the first step in collection prevention technology.
The Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Technology Advanced at the Prestigious University of Tokio in Japan.
See Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Mark Management, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Security School of four Nissan areas.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevention of colitions of the brand vehicles.
Each abe crees its own personal space in ovaled form that seems very like the Nissan Security Scout.
But the most important is the eyes composed of the beach, with a angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located up to two metres away within a 180-degree radio before the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a micro-processor that is immediately translated into the prevention of the collision.
"In the moment when detecting an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a beach and immediately will change direction by turning his wheels into a right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the evasion manual is completely instinct.
If not, the robot would not be able to repeat enough quickly to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratorium and main engineer of this project.
In contrast to a beach, the robot cannot be turned up or down or in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows you to rotate his wheels and not in infinite directions and ways such as arrows.
For this reason, Nissan has used a role of rotation, as well as acceleration and disacceleration, to avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act if these data are.
Do not save information or intuitive logic of previous manuals, so it can continue with only a couple of dozens of KBs of memory.
It may be surprising, but we're not talking about memory gigas, or if it's mines."
This is the first step to develop new instantine prevention technologies of collisions, a technology that Nissan vaticina will be introduced into series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymers batteries, which are lighter and longer than the variety of lithium iones.
Another future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Tremble before you are hypothraced
It is necessary to recognize that the United States Treasure Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not deteriorated by engineering.
Before the crisis, and to avoid shiping and shiping in hypoteques in questionable solvency solvents, they have created an amend and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Anyway, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or the lioes.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and particularly its recipient is to think one, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, especially, where to do it, what probably is his goal.
It is true that you have useful information, but little detailed.
It is more one page for adolescents than one site for all publics.
What if the game is completed?
You may appear an insect room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because buying a better house or talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese, which will pay nine billion dollars to buy 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low low of its quotation in the bag.
One week after a provisional agreement, both of them explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a price of $25.25, or a amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the titles until 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible tickets, which will ensure a 10 % income and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley needed that the global operation would be carried out as a basis for a price for a measure of $29, or a 28% above its current change.
Action Morgan Stanley lost, despite 6,79% to 23,07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the holding status, " explained Juan Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow you to diversify its activities but he makes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces to the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: the past Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of its actions to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
" A week ago," explained Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, " we thought the participation would have been consistent of only assets.
But in view of the current situation of economy and market, we wanted to minimise the risks and cover ourselves. "
With the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its titles to Morgan Stanley a 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert the half of its preferred titles into action within one year if they are sold with more than 50 % over the conversion price, or 47 or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG capitals will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance and increase their liquidity.
A portfolio of the group was refused to give precision on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After Morgan Stanley's investment, Morgan Stanley should show an animal One solvency of approximately 15%, one of the best of the sector.
Morgan needed to have made its balance much alivious from August to the end.
The last weeks have been exhausted for the group, who saw their cotisation in bullet down to half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt was dismissed.
This cost returned last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "super" of Wall Street's big investments after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' cheaps and Merrill Lynch's purchases, announced that he had raised 15 billion dollars, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.

The 19 divorced persons have been released in Chad
A Egyptian command lan’s attack against the raptors of the eleven tourists and its eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight aggregate Egyptians, ten days ago in the wilderness, arrived in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
On the morning, they were released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 15h30 on board of a special plane on the military basis of Al Maza, added to the international port of El Cairo.
Some helicopters brought them immediately to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburbium of El Cairo, to be subject to medical tests, so they could not talk to the press.
"They are well healthy" and "no redemption was paid" to the sequestrators, the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garana stated in the port.
On September 19, these rehens fell in power of 35 unknown sequestrators while enjoying a safari in all the earth in a desert area at the foot of Mount Uanat, in the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they passed from one sulo to another.
The group was integrated by eleven tourists - five Italian, five Germans and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chofers, a front guardian and the director of the Egyptian Travel Agency, under the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian responsible for security indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported by two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before the alba.
"A shooting exchange has occurred, and they killed half the sequestrators, the others have fled," said this responsibility that kept the anonymous.
If he is, he was sent to 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "relampago" unit to Sudan, where they had supported German and Italian commands.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Relations, Franco Frattini, mentioned inherently the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he declared without detail.
Moreover, he dismissed the payment of a ransom.
The winter of the sudanese army had been intercepted during a patrol a whole territory at the board of which the sequestrators were found, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian head and stopped two.
He also appealed that they were related to a revolt group of Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan-Unity, (SLA-U), a delimitation immediately by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes manchettes and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better like that.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always vivid.
Who will rise to declare the weak amounts granted to small museums, files, archaeological excavations or national historical places who die from hunger?
What politics will be attracted to remember the federal government that disregards his monuments and her heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that actually preserve our inheritance as in Canada and Quebec?
Did he know that the French government devoted three and a half million euros to restore it only to the Chinon castle in the Valley of Loira?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the andes and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all selected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the History Societies of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers repeated in 211 historical, heritage, files and genealogies are concerned to search in the history, to preserve a few moneys of private files and to preserve archeological vessels.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, which protest with energy and desperation when promotors and responsibles lay their bulldozers against our old stones and our cementaries.
For what, a monument for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a Belgian-Netherlands Fortis nationalization which is in charge due to the effect of the hypothractic crisis of the North American market: the three countries will totally support EUR 11.2 billion for this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands held consultations at higher level with the President of the European Central Bank and the responsible for the European Commission's economic competition.
Fortis Bank is the first who suffered the crisis of the euro area in the framework of the international financial crisis which is being produced in several oils more than one year ago, thus decisions adopted with regard to the Bank may be considered to be certain.
The decision adopted on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase about half (49 per cent) of the property of the Bank in its area.
The Bank will sell a part of its business, in particular all activities - mainly insurance- purchased last year of the Netherlands ABN Amró.
Fortis's actions started a strong decrease last week, and for the second half of the week, significant signs of crisis were seen in the institution.
However, the analystes agree to note that this Bank is too big with its 85 thousand employees to allow it to be refrigerated.
The company's actions only on Friday had decreased a 12 percent, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of actions has decreased with more than two thirds.
In view of the current prices of the actions, the total value of the market capital is about 14 billion euros, but the company's executives are not real.
The Bank's direction impused the fall of Fortis' actions to the insecurity of the North American market in relation to the approvation of the American package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, action has already shown an easier increase.
On Wednesday, Philip Dierckx was appointed as a new general director.
The Bank also looked for particular investors, but not yet provided a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors had no reason to be concerned, they would not go to their money.
Among the clients of the Bank has not occurred any panic, they have not invaded the offices to recover their money.
Fortis has his own office in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Snow in the gallery
In the United States, living and health insurance companies when seeing data on the purchase of drugs are often refusing to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market is uncontrolled.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which, in all cases, contribute to the approval of the person given.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, we "confident the bullet bullet" - quoted the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the monitoring programme for medical recepts.
Insurance companies depend on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation of the customer health status and if they believe that the risk is strict, they simply do not do the contract.
They sent the customer to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a very beautifuler procedure for ten years ago: with the customer identification number, the list of medicines bought in the last half and half year, and the program itself concluded on the diseases and health status of the customer.
For example, if you systematicly take large doses of pastills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the grass level in the blood is practically high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
A number of versions of the programme are circulated, some even set a number of risks, thus the insurance company has only something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the results of the programme, for example, some medicines are multiused, for example, certain substances serve both to treat head pain and heat walls, even as antidepressives.
This last is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first are not.
Special companies were designed to consult and process these data, which request the patient ' s approval before purchasing the necessary information from pharmacists.
The authorities have already committed this, although they have not been charged for the disgusting of until now.
Some companies recently also develop the results of the tests and join them with the drug consumption data have a more precise information on the health status of the patient.
Every time more company has access to these data and at the same time it is more difficult to control their use.
There is a law for the protection of personal health data, but it is only applicable to insurance companies and services that provide health services.
The draft law is already before the Congress that enables the authority to control specialised undertakings for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: therefore it has developed its programme, which will be the specific approval of the person for the supply of its own personal data.
It is another question that this person cannot refuse its approval, for if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the gallons, despite all, are exposed to the good will of the wheat.
Marsella Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue also dominated the agenda of the nineth summary.
Today, there will also be a French-India summary, in order to mainly treat cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democracy in development that should have more voice and vote in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This question has not been discussed in the nineth summary started yesterday in Marsella.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU turn president, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with which they reached an agreement to duplicate in five years, meaning to increase over 100 million euros, their trade trade.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not a ambitional objective.
Thus they have legally harmonised the twenty-first bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The objective is balance, since while the EU is the first trade partner in India, New Delhi is only in the nineth place between the Union's trade partners.
The summary gave its attention to the global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghanistan and Pakistanian situation and terrorism - all the forms of this last - and expressed the convocation of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalisation round was also initiated, although both parties have great responsibility in their failure.
The EU confirmed that its energy and climate programme will be decreased by at least twenty percent until 2020.
India is also in line with this, as in the next year's climate conference, it should reach a global agreement and reduce up to 2050 with a 50 percent gas production that produces inver­tro effect.
They also want to prevent the increase in food prices and support the convocation of a international conference to revise financial crisis.
Today, the Governing Boss of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - will sign an agreement on the use of peace of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the French companies will receive responsibility for a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactions.
Information on news agency would be the agreement for a 15-year period.

The shops have been found on a highplane of 3000 meters high, in the area of the Nevada Sire of Mammoth Lakes, in the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human residues.
The Commissioner of Madera County, John Anderson, has disclosed the doubts still remaining: "The plane has been located, we have sent a square, and now we have the confirmation that it is itself about what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" said in a press conference.
The Commissioner needed that there were no human residues found in the plane or in the surroundings.
The millionary, 63 years old, has been given for death in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has noticed that a few hours after the rest's advertising, a square of researchers has identified the equipment has been sent: it is the Bellanca 8kcab own, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett was removed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.

It is two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation of Illinois, effective money and one sudare.
Fossett's search has been interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The millionary had been acquired of a place in the history thanks to a long series of premises.
In 2002, the sixth temptation had become the first man to complete the world's road into a globe: two weeks of solar flight.

Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with a original design and well established with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, the lastborn among the "compacts" carriers of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a newness window in this sector.
Proposed of the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and not conventional, the communication accompanied by suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exposure rooms since 17 October.
The public campaign was to be accompanied by the debut of the new car would launch an unnecessary mode of communication to a 3D public campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car mark.
A project with max-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central street of the milanish shopping, advened as, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication starts with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special bottles distributed in the avena As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in tridimensional format.
Actually, looking at the images will be the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Consequently, the new Glk will be illustrated in different times in all its details to be recompensed in one image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of the car communication.
Can you capture the interest of the future buyers with this formula? we will see.
is clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Triveneto, access to sports manifestations is played.
But who are these 150-200 girls and girls of which Italy now has been acquired? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been followed since years and that, too, the truth, has never created too many problems.
And they never had found themselves with the fans of the rival.
The extraction of the group is of de.
The promotors come from the Triveneto.
De Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have been added to a small group (pour units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the soldiers appears: Saturday night they have been taken to be not identified.
They are inspired to English fanatics.
In Bulgaria have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fanatics 144 entries for the party: all with the names, so easily controlled.
And the Ministry of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports) at that moment, no one who had frequently acquired him a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had previous crimes in stadiums, have made their ticket and the travel.
The Ministry of Interior now expects to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take measures: in this case, it is possible to provide the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or to whom has been identified in the disorders.
A Daspo (prohibition of access to sports) which prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand on a stadium.
Fortunately!
But now is the fear of imitation: to those few fifty, others are added.
"We must remove this incendie and not legitimate who is behaving in this way," they support the Ministry of the Internal Affairs.
Therefore, "good open eye" especially in view of the party of the National of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia, there is also a small nuclear of Ultras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory, on Tuesday the Cams can also account with a section of the Aise (Information and external security agency, namely the secret service, which is occupied with the problems in stadiums.
"Will Duce-Duce's corns and the arm raised during Mameli's hire? In Bulgaria isn't a crime ...."
This is the thinking (expressed in a little happy way) of Domenico Mazzi, a few weeks ago the director of the Ministry of the Internal Ministry (he took the position that he was before from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzi_ had been head of Trieste of public security where there was a nuclear of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, based in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzi said, that in Bulgaria it is not wrong to celebrate the Duce but if, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been shameful.
"I don't do the socialist," adds No.1 of the Observatory, "reactions are assigned in the countries where the fact occurs.
Until now, this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take into account it for the future.
But let's also talk about the silvests at Mameli's hire: they are also not a crime, but if they allow them to be of education..."
