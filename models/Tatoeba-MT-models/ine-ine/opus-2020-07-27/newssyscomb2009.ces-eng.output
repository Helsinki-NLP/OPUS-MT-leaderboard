The Triumph of the Right Populations in Croatia, inheritance of 29 percent
The sensitive weakness of both sides of a large coalition and a significant strengthening of the rights of the population party has brought on Sunday preliminary parliamentary elections in Russia, according to the first preliminary results.
Especially strong losses have suffered by the Russian People's Party (PPE), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously distorted.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of Swaza for the future of Russia (BZÖ), the Korean leader Jörg Haider wants a triumphal return to the national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the most strong part of the social democracy (PPE) country remains with 29.8 per cent of votes against the last elections of 2006, however, the loss of 5.5 per cent of votes.
More worse, the EUP has lost 25.6 per cent and nine per cent of votes.
These are the worst results of both of these large parties in the Russian military history, and especially in people who have called previous elections, a disaster.
On the beginning of July, when the EPP came out of the coal, people in the preferences before the SPÖ had a significant step.
However, the electors have apparently disappointed them because they have allowed the government to deteriorate.
In the first reactions to the outcome, speculations about the possibility of rejecting the president of the party and the Officer Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers judge that this could be done on Monday, at the extraordinary meeting of the presidential party.
This development would obviously facilitate the road to the most likely east of the electoral outcome, thus to renew the large coal of the SPUE and the AGP.
In view of the strengthening of both the rights of the population parties - the freedom (FPÖ) had already received 18 per cent and the 11 per cent of the BZÖ votes - but the social democrats also expressed the concerns of the repeat in 1999 when people agreed with the people (which was still a single FPÖ, in 2005 the BZÖ was discharged) to a common government that had even caused a sanction from the European Union.
This development is obviously appealing to Haider, who has already stated that it is ready to cooperate with any party and is supposed to return to Vienna to the national policy.
The Green Paper has also reached the Parliament, but it has easily lost and fallen between the Russian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
None of the other parts apparently the four-percent border has passed, and it has not reached Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Vztahy s India can be coated
It would not be possible to solve the problem with the Czech doctors who were accused of the illegal collection of brokers in India, according to the Czech Ministry, Karla Schwarzenberg, to a certain heating of the Czech and Indian relations.
The Minister introduced this in New York after his today's meeting with his Indian Protestant Pranab Mukherdžy.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then yes, then it would have happened to a certain heating," he found after a meeting that was performed from the Czech initiative.
Mukhardžy said that the execution could be too difficult for the court cases.
However, he noted that in the case of Petra Svachy, who had been forgotten and sent to repentance, the Central Government may act with the local government in Darjiling, where the matter is in its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emila Cuchera sentenced to three years of adoption it would be the best, according to Mukhardžy, to call for a higher institution.
Then he could ask for the release of the cow and wait for the judgment of freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also was born in the course of negotiation.
"He recommends a revocation to the higher court, then it might be possible to mislead it," said the Czech diplomacy boss.
The only way that the Czech party can enter into the entire matter is to provide a convicted "qualified legal support", said the Indian Minister.
In addition, he said that such a help already provides them by the side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India that have a year old tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
In addition, as the CTC said, before his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic is a major importance to the problem of the Czech Entomologists.
"We consider the truth to be a deep error in prison and regret of these Czech men," he declared.
The answer to the question whether he received the promises to take place from the Indian side, the Minister was dismissed.
"I've already got relatively enough promises," he only observed.
Czech judges the battle on the floor of the sea
It is accessible to the substitute electronic map which is represented in Australia and the adjacent sea.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with him, and the marine floor.
However, the area is great as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuoso, who belongs to the thirty-first working team of the United Nations division for the marine and maritime rights.
His boss, Director of Divisions, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the explanation follows and sometimes completes.
He's ruled over this job. He's stuck and healing.
The seabound is hiding a little famous world, rich on natural sources.
There can be a statement of rubber, reds and other irritable sugars, but even the unknown living organisms, which have the key to develop drugs against cancer.
Down more than pe
The coast states today have started to retain the new sub-sea territory.
According to the United Nations Convention, it also uses its rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly about a so-called continental shelf, which often swims up to a hundred miles from the coast of the country.
It has an exclusive sentence under the Convention on all the sources of the continental shelf.
"It is simply taken, for the continental shelf, that part of the sea's bottom and its subsequence, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
Saha outside the coast sea border, often outside the border of two hundred miles, etc. exclusive economic areas," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shelf must be submitted by a comprehensive technical documentation based on a number of cost reviews and measurements.
It's a series of years of ready work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has yet negotiated five requests, which are Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
There have been only three last countries mentioned," adds Miculka.
The World Voice has recently mentioned the success of Australia, which has largely expanded its sub-sea countries as the first.
But also New Zealand - the depth of the sea day, which the Commission had admitted last week, is about 1,6 million square kilometers, so about six times more than the size of the State alone.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in investigation.
The winning that will be to them in the future from the use of the sea’s day will be unvaluable, as they promise.
Its requests shall be submitted gradually to the other States.
They can do that up to ten years since they've got a "contract from Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, it begins the ocean day, announced by the convention as "the communal inheritance of mankind".
There is no exceptional position here.
The right of charge in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabound but there is no Klondike," director Mikulka says in the officer, "their individuals are legally defined and their regime is contractually deprived."
Czech in the Implementation
The part of the Sea Down of today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are related to the other states of some east blocks in the Common Interoceanmetal Organization.
This obtained in 1991 according to the convention, as the investors of some other countries, the status of the "profederal investor".
He has the right to weigh in the area of RioClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
Investor's investigated is something more important than former Czech Republic.
The bottom is there members, it's a cool subsea-replication Tater.
"It can be weakened on the table with a total division of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich finding of polymetallic specifications containing nigles, brass, cobalt and mangan," says the next lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Rober Sandev Division brings one such specification to show.
At a small brambore or at a little fantasy, a horrible team that, according to the legends, survived Golem.
German special sample units were in freedom of hands
The Egyptian government requested help from Germany - experts adopted.
When the deterioration was avoided, special units were prepared, but it did not come to saddle.
More details are made available to the public by the situation of the eleventh freedom of European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Defence Minister and the Inside, the German special forces also participated in salvation action.
According to the statement of the Ministers, there were also social military experts, so members of the German Anti-Terrorist Group of GSG9, social police years, the Social Criminal Authority, as well as experts on technical assistance logistics (Technisches Hilfswerk).
According to the next announcement of the speakers of both ministers from Monday afternoon, however, the German forces did not need because the prisoners left their captives to go and flee when they broke the signs of violent release.
According to Germany, the Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered as a supporting force for action at the place.
"Fortunately, it wasn't done," said one of the speakers of the Social Ministry inside.
The attackers introduced a group of travellers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romans and eight of their Egyptians in September 19, South Egypt.
After entering in the wilderness in the south of Egypt, hands were moved in the streets of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The benefits remained unexpected at the last time, as well as the details of the freedom or the possible payment of the redemption.
Now, salvation is all right in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the freedom of hands is in the care of the German ambassadors.
He wasn't focused on the details of release.
In Berlin, there are no information available when salvation returns to Germany.
According to the letter "Image" all five tourists should also fly with special forces by one of the Airbuss of German airport and get to Germany on Wednesday.
America's Sneam of representatives refused salvation package
By the United States Congress room, the sale package for financial markets was a value of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index has fallen strongly.
In relation to 206 to 227 votes, the American Snemovva Representative of Government was refused to save the financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of the American President George W. Bushe and both sides of the chief policies, it was not found for a programme to reduce chaos on financial markets.
The dramatic actions were often trying to convince the pack critics of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote of a lawyer to declare a consent, although the plan, as he was expressed, was not a harmful plan.
"It is hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet been done," he admitted.
During the vote, the index Dow Jones was over six percent, or 600 points.
It was anxiety of investors that the state salvation package could fall.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that after the notification of the packaging was reported, it would again fall strictly.
Professors now count with other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to agree with the Secretary-General's representatives and Senate.
Travel of agencies in exchange
The winter seems to be good for German businessers on the road:
According to one study, in the booking of enterprises for the next month in comparison to the previous year, he increased a significant turnover - to the winter is even more than 30 per cent.
Despite the weak economic growth, Germans are willing to travel uncovered.
In the winter reservations, the officers exchanged the road with 31 per cent of the ratio of the same period of the year, as the German road in Berlin indicated on Monday (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, there are also increased booking numbers available for underground months.
The turnover was thus, according to the statement of the DRV in October compared to 2007, about 11 per cent higher.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices each month and interpolates them on the total market.
In this outcome, the reservations of travels were included until the end of August 2008.
For a weak dollar course they are requested primarily to the United States, the DRV stated.
In these roads, there is approximately one third of the reserve.
In addition, Germans are particularly required for Spain, Turkey and Greece and domestic waters.
Pre-organized interviews are in the course, President DRV Klaus Laepple declared.
In view of the costs of energy and food, "for the customer's customer, the costs are readable than for individually organised allowed."
Laepple explained that the money consumers otherwise can protect the use of the release for a temporary booking or all-service offer.
Even in the years, the amount of booking was very good, so, in comparison to the previous year, it will be a higher turnover - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who have been traveling along with the previous year has decreased.
My first feast of October
Donekone repeated beer, beer of tubs and prominents in the crowns of famous farmers.
First on the pit's shit.
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have too much common.
She's a blonde, a television moderate, and wears the ear's round.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my clothes are out of the second hand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on a drink, and photographs are already packed on us, and we're fully filled with memory cards -- that's my trouble, I'm on October first.
That's how you can be friends.
It seems that my leaving crown has fulfilled his own.
I'm here as a tourist and I'm living north of a clobase roeca, and so my feeling was more pleasant in the cross.
But right after it comes to Theresienwiese, everything's better than it seemed.
Almost everyone has a female crown or a skin cow; no one looks disappointed or crazyly touched - everything is completely normal.
Special views at the station with bananas in chocolate are just coming to my coat.
One Mnichovanka warns me that I was wrongly linked to her, "You are free at the left, at the lady's, given, back of her."
They're driving the back to the left.
"Good," he says and smiles.
Others with subtil fleeting technicians are so unsuccessful and they have a simple flooded bowl with the title "This dressed it get dressed!" and stretch on the rounding backs.
The young man with such exhibitionists is named Bob, he came from England and on October.
He seems "gorgeous" with a long-term "hoo".
It's gonna tell me after he got a little bit of a drink.
Just next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks they're waste waste.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as in Bavorska is called freely powerful people in public.
Others have no lucky to get out of this way of alcohol.
About the eighth evening runs on the area where Octoberfest is to be held, health careers who have to take care of the strange drinks.
Medicines are presented in the halls - in four wears a covered weapons from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like the number of visits of pivots: empty there, filled again.
He who lies under the flash of this cancer from love is not to see.
"It's just those who can't be able to continue," he calls me in answer to my question and disappears in the dada.
Police published the name of the accident victim
The name of a thirty-five-year woman died in the hospital after the car hit her in Essex was published.
Injury to Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon, Carole Paulson arrived from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital hospital in Romeford, but she died later.
After a accident, a 15-year-old man was arrested to be suspicious of an invisible driving.
He's been released on the police cow.
Turkey diplomatic views are expanded
So long before Turkey began to try to enter into the European Union, the European power was deeply forced to get into the Turkish frontier.
On the East Coast of Bospore, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, are one of the best memories of this imperial ambition.
The Hydarpash rail station was proposed by two German teams Otto Ritter and Helmuth Conu in the non-orientational state.
Then they'll tell you the tourists.
The building is sitting at the end of the entrance on each corner of the opposite, in view of the non-discrimination from the Provincial German Council.
The stone's crazy.
The whole building is slowly spread.
But as soon as a person gets inside a closed treasure, he cannot have any doubt of the size of the business, whose most westest station was.
In August 1908 the station opened the German consortium Anatolian-Bagdad corporation.
Germany, which had been involved in the game late, was intended to implement its ambition to control the Near East through this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Bagdad and further to the Territory of Saudi Arabia today.
But the German imperial ambitions were injured during the first world war.
They were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relationships of isolation from the surrounding territory, resulting in frozen borders of cold war, is away
British and colonial units traveled from Egypt and extracted Turkey and their German associations from Palestinian and Syria.
And the Hydarpash station also came bad news.
In 1917, he destroyed the exhibition of the munitional drag.
The Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since that time, it's been gradually dressed and it's been kept.
However, this gate today serves to Anatolia and continues to east - at least symbolically - to highlight the extensive views of the Turkish diplomacy.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a completely new policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territory, resulting in the frozen borders of the cold war, is away.
The new policy is now applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is notable that the Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I put on the night move to the Turkish Major City of Ankar, where I had to meet one of the former ACP experts on the foreign policy, the Turkish Deputy Suat Kinikliog.
Next - about ten and a half hours posti - after the codric driving after the rows that remembered the old world rites of the known Night Post document, I arrived in the Turkish metropole, designed as a new city for the secondary state, which wants to turn back to his Otoman past.
However, the ACP with its well-known islamic roots represents the movement of the Turkish consensus paradigma.
On the west, she had a suspicion, especially in Washington.
The Taxi brought me to the AKP main state, the ultramoderous stone and metal building, intended to develop, a half-covered trading houses and traders in power, where the median business managers - men and women - will meet to make fast trade hurt.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right policy of almost every other European political party.
Sako, crazy, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The objective of the party's policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest environment.
The Student War was anonymous," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from his limit.
Today, he must look to the east and to the west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both of them.
"But it'll be a moment," I asked, "when Turkey might have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "he didn't want to make such a decision."
Then he highlighted what almost all of the people I spoke here said to remember: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with Kavkaz and around the Black Sea are the same for the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
Turkey on the ground seems that Europe can, as a whole, go through the metaphorics to the east of Asia and the Middle East.
From the Hydarpas station, after the next last night, I thought about the two German Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu who followed how this building was built 100 years ago.
How would they be surprised if they discovered that European ambitions on the Middle East could now be, of a major part, in Turkish hands.
And when I waited for a traject of Bospore, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there were no doubts that the continent should have a sentence on this fascinating country.
Memorial lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a guildford music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, 11 September) had a filharmonic orchestra and a congregation in Guildford.
As part of the periodic music plan, a year has been based on this excellent assembly of young Proteus.
It should have been until 21 years, but at the time Proteus sang success in 1979, some of us were 30 - we simply refused to deliver the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of things) represented the will and ability of the congregation to go into any music that was submitted to him - whether madrigali or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often a horrible, exciting, and all this through inspiration of the only man and the musical exciting, which remained completely unchanged for all the time.
How often Tod told us, and they "leaved music to talk for themselves."
He said, "The Creator knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it! "
His tattoo technology was completely strict and accurate, but it was not even dictatorical or florative.
Any music standard anywhere, he's still getting him.
John Frayn Turner writes:
He was supposed to have a leader matched the rider, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he directed the Guildford philharomynic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I reviewed more than 100 his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them -- and I was inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal humility.
He hated the leaders who, according to his words, simply "sleep one or two pecks in the world."
It'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrolog William Woodrubf (September 25th) states that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied to BSc, MA and PhD."
This comes from Woodrubfo's notes of the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not exact.
From 1946 to 1953, he learned the economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then assigned disertation work to the British Gumaren Industrie conducted by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as the British Gumaren Industrie.
He actually worked in 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philosophical College
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black photos are fair.
I was disappointed by simplicity and strong baths, with which they act on wheels, and attitude and respect for photographed.
An expression that shows many others.
Resina can take magical moments."
Honda's underground attack with his bestseller
In November, Honda starts to sell the second generation of Jazz model.
If the leader of this single-space vehicle already had a significant space, he now offers a more space inside.
This includes improved engines that increase the comfort of the driving and allow more fuel support.
Evolution is more than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, this single space vehicle has made many changes.
For example, it is necessary to mention innovative design, new platform, more dimensions and new engines.
Before we examine the new model, it is necessary to note that the new Jazz is coming on the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
Therefore, the first thing we note is that Honda needed a shorter period of this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less famous model in Europe, on other markets he became a phenomenon in the sale.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, as well as during the year 2008.
Just in Japan, from the introduction of Hondy Jazz on the market, a million of kiss were sold.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half billion sales in six years.
Honda, however, claims to make the new Jazz increase the sale in his category.
In 2007, while this Japanese company sold in total 83,000 hours of Hondy Jazz, 100,000 cars were estimated in 2009, which would mean a growth of 17% on the European market.
The Spanish market has been sold by Honda since 2002 to a total of 8000 coins of Jazz model, which means 6,7 % of the total sale of Hondy in Spain.
This is a new generation of Jazz, the leading of the Spanish bathroom is expected to sell 2 000 kiss for the whole year.
Once the arrival of the new Jazz will enable Honda to decrease the decrease of sales in Spain.
The car management so de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sale cups, which means 4000 less than in 2007 and decreases by 16 %.
Honda, despite this growth of sales, increased its share in the Spanish market by 1.8 %, exceeding 1.6 % from the year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2 %.
In order to achieve this share, Honda is focusing on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-hour hybrid compact size of 4,37 metres long, from which the Japanese company promises the global sale of approximately 200 000 cuss per year.
This is the market, according to the estimates of the Japanese producer, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States while the remaining percentage will divide the old continent and Japan.
The start of the sale of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of the next year as soon as the public is represented in January in Valencia.
In contrast to the first generation, the new Jazz increased all dimensions.
His length increased to 3.9 metres (5 meters more), a width of 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and a width of 2.5 metres, which means a length of five metres.
Instead, the height hasn't changed and does still 1.52 meters.
Increasing dimensions also increased the internal space.
However, these advantages were achieved by using a new platform, but by storing the fuel content of the vehicle already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
The amount of the legacy space - which has a double-drop system - has also increased up to 399 litres, with 19 litres more than the volume of the legacy space in the first generation.
It is necessary to note that these dimensions are presented in the version 1.4 of the engine, because the volume of the binding space in Hondy Jazz is 379 litres.
Another perfection other than external elements - such as the back LED lights or the possibility of equipment that is a panoramic shield - is easier access to the back seat.
The door leading to the second series of seats allows the angle to open 80 degrees above 67 in the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz has new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two benzin engines 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both engines use ≥ i-VTEC, which allows lower need, lower than carbon oxide and brings an excellent improvement of the fuel system rather than a high precision moment in the full range of engine turns.
The engine with a volume of 1,2 litres has 90 horses at 6000 rotations with a maximum precision point of 114 Nm at 4 900 rotations.
This engine - which had in the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - needs 5,3 litres and 125 grams CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combination of 5,4 litres and 128 grams CO2.
"Wheel whistle" prevents the whistle
In progress in the development of protection against accidents, Nissan inspired me this time in nature, particularly at the season.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes it as a pattern of flight night, and thus prevents the swimming.
This is bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the prevention of the swimming.
The Engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress, Nissan Motor Co., developed robots in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in the Japanese Prestigious University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the Director-General of Public Relations for ○ia, Research and Label Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four areas of the Nissana security shield.
The robot has a task to strengthen the ability to prevention of the shoes at the cars of this label.
During the flight, each night, it creates its own personal space of the ova, which looks very like the security shield of Nissana.
The most important, however, are the eye's desires that are able to see in all directions in a corner of more than 300 degrees, which generally allows flight in their private space without stop.
The engineers in the creation of this visibility on what they called the laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This specifies obstacles that are fixed up to two meters from the range of 180 degrees before the BR23C, calculating the distance of the object and sending a signal to the palub microprocessor, which immediately transfers it to the warning before the collision.
"In the moment when an interruption is mentioned, the robots will imitate the motion's desires and will immediately change the direction of rotating the round to the right or even more equivalent angle to prevent the swimming.
The biggest difference in any existing system is that all dangerous maneves are completely instinct.
If it wasn't so, the robot would not be able to respond enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, manager of Mobile Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
The robot cannot move to the distance of the wheel by the direction up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction that is enabled to turn his wheel, however, in an incredible quantity of directions and options as the wheel.
That is why Nissan uses the rotation, besides delay and delay, to prevent the robbery.
"The establishment is only to process information for each couple of seconds and to maintain in accordance with these data.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneves, which can work without interruption with only two kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we are not talking about giga or mega."
This is the first step in the development of new Property immediate prevention of the swimming, in which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than lithium-ion.
Another future use of this section could be the building of an entity into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the goal and at the same time disappear on the road.
Rejoice in fear before you take a hypothec
It is necessary to recognize that the US Ministry of Finance is missing, unless it is enough for injection.
Face in the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from preventing risk hypothetics from banking with doubtful solvency, it created on the Internet a "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or a bad credit hotel... or a holiday.
The hotel and particularly his receipt seem to be humble to think about the right moment to ask for a credit once, twice and three times.
And mostly where to ask, which is probably her purpose.
It is that the game contains useful information, even if it is not too detailed.
It's a page more suitable for youth than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, there's a dream room.
At least something, because you don't talk about buying ra's house...
Morgan Stanley opens his MUFG
Banko's house Morgan Stanley reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, which issues nine billion dollars to get 21% of its acquirement.
Weekly after the conclusion of the agreement, both banks explained that MUFG would buy 9,9 % of the current shares of Morgan Stanley at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total amount of $3 billion.
The united price is 19 % lower than the annual value of value papers until 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests the additional six billion dollars to obtain convertible value papers, which will guarantee 10% of the cost and whose change price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the whole operation would be performed on the basis of the average unit price of $29, which is 28 % under its current course.
The actions of Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79% and got $23.07 at the time of Greenwich about 17.00.
"This strategic association represents an important opportunity for the transition of Morgan Stanley to the bank holding status," explained John Mack, Director-General of this American group.
The new statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which has to allow him to increase his activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the largest axe from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The submissions presented on Monday, otherwise, show that the agreement was changed in the last few days: on the past Monday, Morgan only announced that it sold up to 20 % of its shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director MUFG, "that our ability would be exclusively from running actions.
However, in view of the current economy and market, we wanted to limit the risk to minimum and to cover."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's values by 7 % less than their annual value.
And the operation will be the result of decreasing profits from a share of about 20%.
The Agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential value papers to the current action for a year, if they are finally appointed to change to the price of 50 % exceeding the change price, i.e. by approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the MUFG guard will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase its finance.
However, the speaking group refused to provide specific information on the strategic projects of both new associates.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should praise the proportion of the payability of the Tier One about 15 %, so one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since August's end, he's decreased his balance.
In the last weeks, the group was demanded, since the course was over half, while the costs against the risk of non-payment related to the debt were increased.
These costs took a reverse development on Monday, however, about 12% remained high.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "overleving" of the big investment banks Wall Street after the dead of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, chose 15 billion dollars, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffetta group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Rebuild the Republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
This is a common project of Venezuelce Huga Chaveze, Boliviace Eva Moralese and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Wednesday, the third appointment proposed to vote, according to the model of his adversaries and friends, to the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, since 64% of the electors, according to official results covering 80% of votes, voted in the reference "yes".
"No" was obtained by 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0.7 % of the voting letters were empty.
To accept the Constitution, he had to get half of the voices plus one.
Two studies performed in the east of election rooms and the budget of the non-governmental organizations forwarded "yes" on Sunday winning, while they worked at 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa last night on Monday to Monday requested his victory by the Constitution.
"The Constitution wins the whole line," he admired and congratulated the Ecuadors in the Guayaquil government seat, 280 km southwest from Quit.
Itself understands that Rafael Correa has received blessings from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chile Protestant, Michelle Bachelets.
The vote that, according to the observation mission of the United States (OEA), was quietly played in the text of 444 points of "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The Constitution dedicates the power of the State over the economy by replaced him by the "planning of the country's development" which lives primarily from the burden of oil by other companies and by the device which is sent by its emigrants.
Our protected Correu, who was chosen in 2006, also expands the power of the State's head, which will be able to carry out two four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to discharge the vote.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will take care of the new mandate in February 2009.
In addition, the Constitution sets out the principle of free health and education that the President began to introduce in the country with 13,9 million people where 50% of the population live under poverty.
Finally, it also counts on the prohibition of the presence of foreign armies, which will conclude the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Equatorial Base as a standard point of American anti-drogue operations.
In Chad, 19 hands were released.
The Egyptian team took an attack on the eleven tourists and their eighty-eight-day transmission, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptians who were ten days in prison in the wilderness were moved to Egypt's main city on Monday.
During the time of Chad, the Egyptian command was released.
The hands flew about 15.30, obviously in a good form, on a special aircraft on a military based al-Maza, closely neighbors with international aircraft in Cairo.
Immediately, they were transferred without having the opportunity to be printed on the helicopter in Maadi hospital, the quarter of Cahira's border residential to be detailed by medical viewers.
"They're completely stumbled" and "no redemption was paid to the strangers," the Egyptian tourism Minister Zoheir Garran announced on the roadway.
Since 19 September his captivity during safari in the vehicle with all four rounds on the top of Mount Uanat, in Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hands was stuck from one hide to another 35 unknown entries.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romania - and also eight Egyptians: two springs, four drivers, one board manager of Egyptus, safari organisations.
A certain leader of Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of the special units that approached two helicopters on the floor came to the end of the night closely before the decade.
"There was a shooter, half of the insects were killed and finally fled," said this source, who wanted to stay anonymously.
He noted that 150 members of Egyptian special forces from the "belk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support for German and Italian commands.
The Italian diplomatic boss Franco Frattini changed from Belgrade, where it is right, about the role that secret agents and Italian special forces have played.
"We have to recognize that we have reached this outcome by professionally and effectively people of our secret services, with special forces," he declared without other claims.
He also claimed that it would be paid for the redemption.
At the earlier night, the Sudan army announced that in the guard, the vehicle was stopped with the roof of all four rounds, on which the rounds were thrown, and six killed by the Chad commander and two arrests.
The Army claimed that they were attracted to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately denied that movement.
Letters - Cultural resort silence
The debate on the financing of culture is full of newspaper titles and is the subject of a pre-optional campaign.
That's better.
However, one of our cultural life is still memorized.
Who will rise to preserve the poor amounts provided by small museums, and to the archaeological sepultures, and to the national memory places that defeat hunger?
Which policies will have to remember the federal government that they remember their memories and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no laws that would protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has three and a half million euros to restore only the Chinon lock in Loiry valley?
Our neighbors are written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the Americans, and that this inheritance should be protected by all citizens, all selected representatives and all national organizations, and in fact.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the company for the history of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers associated with 211 historical companies, memories, and genealogies on the discovery of history, the conservation of the homode of private and the protection of the archaeological residues for a few minors.
Often these companies are just watching dogs of our memories, which are protesting unnaturally when promotors and leaders release their buldozers on old stones and forgot bursts.
When will we finally wait for stories and memories?
The Benelux governments of the Bank Fortis
The Benelux States will help Belgian-Nederland Fortis, which has been the first in Europe, to enhance the crisis of the American hypothetic market, partial consciousness: three countries will support the money and insurance establishment, which also has a share of 11,2 billion euros in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands Government agreed on this week for the President of the European Central Bank and European Commissioners for Economic Competition.
The Bank Fortis is the first in the euro, which, in the crisis of international financial markets, extended in waves longer than a year, has reached a great crisis, and the decision taken in this matter could be considered as a view of a view.
In the meaning of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three countries will buy half (49 per cent) of the dark bank's ownership.
The Bank sells parts of its security, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased by the Netherlands Bank ABN Amro in the remote year.
The Banks of Fortis have started to decrease last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis have already occurred in the constitution.
However, the analysers agree that the bank is too big with their 85 thousand employees to allow it to be discharged.
The price papers of the company fell only on Friday at 12 per cent, at the minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of the action was decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market value of the group moves about 14 billion euros, however, it is not real, according to the leading representatives of the company.
The management of the company finally is due to the fall of Fortis's action on the maritime market, relating to the adoption of the American package plan at $700 billion.
The action was quietly stepped on Monday.
On Friday, the new General Director Philip Dierckx was appointed in the head of the bank.
The money establishment also searched for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet been notified.
The Government has previously notified that investors should not be afraid, they will not come about their money.
The bank's clients haven't been paniced yet, and the sides weren't awakened by an attack.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has a separate side and has also cut a few leasing fires.

Life and health in America based on human purchase data of medicines are often enabled to close with an insurance insurance.
The data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrolled.
"There is a data protection programme which weighs the use of the prescribed medicines in any case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hand of someone independent, elsewhere we believe the library," quotes the newspaper Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the programme intended to follow the prescription of medicines.
The insurance company shall make the amounts paid in the case of deficiencies depending on the health status of interesters, and if the risk is estimated as too big, the insurance with it shall not be allowed.
Earlier, they sent the medical investigations and concluded only when they knew their outcomes.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more nice procedure: based on the identification number, the client from the doctor will easily find out what medicines he bought for the last year and half, from which the program itself results in which he suffers with disease and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large quantity of medicines for cholesterol decreasing, it refers to that practices have an uncontrolled high heat of blood tubes, which will immediately include it in a higher risk category.
There are just a few versions of the programme, some specify at the same time the risk coefficient, so there is no job, even though there is a small degree.
In cases of advantages, we can use lester medicines too for some, some associations, for example, are useful against migration or heat inflammation, but also against depression.
They represent a significant factor of commercial security that increases the risk, where the first named is no longer affected.
For the requesting and processing of data, special companys were created, which were requested to be authorised before the physician took care of the necessary information.
That is what the authority now needs, perhaps they have not been disappointed because of their sustainable failure.
Some companies have recently processed and analysis of studies associated with the data on the medicines used, so that they can provide a more accurate image of the health status of patients.
The data are still more enhanced, and the control of their use will continue to be more complex.
There is a special law on the protection of health status data, but its validity is only related to the provider of health services and security.
The law that provides authority to the authorities to control and to specialized undertakings for data delivery is before the Congress.
Richard Dick recognizes that it will be quick: therefore it has developed its program so that data processing is linked to the expressional agreement of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the relevant authorisation can only be able to refuse, elsewhere, the insurance with it will not be closed.
So the blinds are just sometimes denied to a good thing.

The European Union and India double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual main trade partners, this subject has led to further, mainly global problems, also the order of the nineth meeting at the highest level.
Today, it will also take place a French and Indian sum, which will mainly take place for cooperation in the Atom Energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a developing democracy power that should be given more opportunities to speak to international matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the continuous member of the New District Council of the United Nations Security.
This question was not yet addressed on yesterday, the nineth sum of Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for the Employment Policy Javier Solana welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singha, with which they agreed that the trade would be doubled up to five years, or that it would grow to more than 100 billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods was from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, there is no ambitional objective.
In the meaning of this, in legal view, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were so green to the future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised that the acts would be taken.
The goal is to balance the balance, while the EU is the first trade partner of India, the New Dilli is between EU partners and nineth place.
The summit also focused on global matters.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively terrorism - both sides in all its forms were condemned and invited to call the United Nations.
They also claimed to finish the road of trade negotiations from Dauha, although both have a large share in his effective accident.
The European Union confirmed that it would take its energy and climate programme, which would reduce the damaged substances by at least twenty per cent by 2020.
In this regard, India agreed, as well as that in the following year the global agreement and the production of gases resulting in reducing the steel effect to 2050 to 50 per cent would be required.
Both parties would also prohibit the increase in food prices and support the calling for international financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today is engaged in the French main city, where he wants to close trade in the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
Parishes that the construction of Indian nuclear reactions in the value of 20 billion euros are obtained by French companies.
According to the Agency’s reports, the agreement should apply to 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
The largest Italian publishers on the International Country Commander in Frankfurt.

Flight found by Steva Fossett, a millioner that disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steva Fossett’s aircraft, a millioner, who disappeared on 3 March 2007 while overflowing the destruction in Nevada.
Troskys were discovered at one top level in the oversea, three thousand meters high, in the Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
However, there was no human residue within the airport.
Sheriff Mader County, John Anderson, made doubts still remaining: "The flight was found, we sent the team there and now we have the sure that it is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he was missing" he said to one printing.
So the sheriff stated that human residues were not found in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millioner has been considered dead since February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after recognition of concerns was sent to an investigation team that finally identified the aircraft: it was exactly Bellanc 8kcab, unreported from 3 September 2007 when Fossett was traveling from Yerington in Nevada to the Tri-hour Aviation.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal subjects were found with one couple near their residence in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Management, money in preparation and one bound.
Fossett's search was interrupted monthly after his disappearance.
The billioner got a place in the history thanks to the long assembly of primacy.
In 2002, for the sixth trial, he became the first man who ended the road around the world in the air balloon: two weeks a year alone.
Three years later, the world was flying in the aircraft and without an accommodation.
Its many records also includes 15 445 meters height, over the Andes, even though with the copper.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined determined lines, wide surfaces with precise angles.
This is, in the shortcut, the lastborn Glk from the "compact" sheep of the star's house, which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a newspaper into this sector.
Just thanks to his untraditional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communications that will bring Suv Glk to the market and will be available in the showroome Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
In this way, the public campaign, which brings the debut of the new vehicle, starts an unofficial way of communication also through the future 3D platform campaign, which is the first used in Italy for car marking.
The project of max plates, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan Trade Class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
By the phase of this new type of communication, the presentation of a car in stereoscopic vision and using special brilliants that will be divided near Corsa Como, will be possible to see the new Suv in the dimensions of the size and in a three-dimensional format.
Actually, when you're looking at the picture, you'll have the idea that the car's going out of the plateau.
After that, using innovation · Elumina8, the new Glk will be lighted at different moments in all its little ones, so that it will be replaced in the only image.
Mercedes certainly trys to introduce this advertising something new into the stereotype car communication.
Will he be able to build up the interest of the future clients?
So we know who the Italian chuligians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 boys and boys who are now in Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group who has been following Nazurra for years and who has never done overwhelmed problems yet.
She never met a fan's against a man.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founder comes from Trivenet.
From Verony, Padvy, Terstu and Udine.
In Sofia, groups of groups (in a few groups) were added to them from Campania and Puglie.
They have triple-color flags on which the cities of pÃa participated are discovered: they removed them on Saturday evening so that they were not recognised.
They're inspired in Ethiopian fans.
In Bulgaria, they found the true Nazi fans, Lewski.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 income to the stock: all for name, so easily controlled.
And Viminale checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the running Dasl, no one who would be prohibited to visit stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous transitions from the stadium were rejected and prohibited.
Now Viminale expects to read the news that comes from the Bulgarian police, then to take measures: In this case it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the fans arrested or to those who were identified during the emergency.
International Daspo, which prohibits not only to visit Italian stages but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, soon, don't go to one stage.
Fortunately.
However, there is fear of emulation: this means that more than 100 are added to them.
"We have to catch this fire immediately and not justify those who do so," they confirmed Viminal.
So, "very open eyes, mainly because of a national deceit in the middle of Lechi."
Just in Puglia, there's a small nuclear support.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio, on Wednesday Casms, who can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that is just concerned about the problems of stadiums.
"The Congregation Leader-Cheef and the locked pair during Momel's hymne? It's not a crime in Bulgaria."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzi _BAR_ in a few weeks, which is the director of Viminal Osservatoria (the place that was previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzi's previous quarter in Terstu, where the nuclear supporters of Ultras Italia, based in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzi said, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but, of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is disappointed.
"I'm not a sociologist -- adds the Osservator unit – crimes are adjudicated to the country in which they have been.
This group has still remained in front of the borders, now we are looking closely at what happened and we will consider the future.
But let's also talk about staring with Mommy's himn: it's not a crime, but if you allow, it's inevitably..."
