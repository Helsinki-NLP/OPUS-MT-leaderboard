I'll miss you when you leave.
He's eight years old.
Do you have these bottles in my size?
Tom didn't see anything extraordinary.
Where are you?
They saw him throw his waste into the forest.
I'll do it right now.
It was a bitter and bitter move.
I'd like to lie to Tom.
Tom shouldn't just look as inactively as Mary's kissing.
Look, there's a cat in the kitchen!
He can't do it to anyone else.
You were loved by this man because of your wealth.
Call him, please.
Tom and I are guilty.

I've been thinking about you a lot.
It's my brother's friend's sister.
The problem is that I don't remember where I parked the car.
She told him he hated the wallets.
She said she was locked up.
Who's the recorder?
It's like a bad dream.
This size is too big for me.
Then there was a guest that stayed up to the celebration.
I had to protect them.
Do you have French wine?
I'd like to be your wife.
Tom isn't usual for city life.
Who's there?
I just know Tom.
Tell me about Tom's word, and you've got a fall.
I really have to run.
What are you going to do tonight?
Nobody told me you were waiting for me.
She's returned the cup from the box to the place.
I'll just get out of the steps.

Don't worry about it.
What do you have in the bathroom?
Tom's doing things I'm not doing.
Are you for his idea or against him?
I told Tom not to give up.
Tom doesn't follow war movies.
You're not alone.
I know it's a big demand.
Tom looks like Harry Potter.
They created a new company in London.
He said he hated her.
He must take care of your mistakes.
They dropped her into the store and violated her.
I told him what I think of him.
When are you going to your new house?
I'm the black sheep of the family.
You're missing nobody.
Mary wept while Tom laughed.
You can't sell here.
I'll take her back.
I've just ventilated.
Sometimes I'm playing a shadow.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I'm not planning to be like this.
If she's late, give her this message.

I have to get Tom out of here.
I'm as old as Tom.
Tom told me she wasn't hungry.

It's a crap.
Call me, okay?
Beduin live in the wilderness.

It doesn't work, isn't it?
Tom's gonna miss me and everything he represented.
Don't worry about it.
My consciousness is clean, but you obviously don't.
I opened the door and went in.
Mallars are painting.
Did you know Tom's register in the penalty record?
I think they should have continued outside in this conversation.

The choice is a group of people who can't do anything individually, but as a group they can get together and decide that nothing can't be done.

I'm ready to die.
You shouldn't be afraid of the future.
Let's talk to Vabindula and Yuelami!
Thank you for working.
Many people go to the Hod of God's worm.

Doesn't he shine anywhere unclean?
He didn't have a warm one.
Can you look at me at the crap?
I knew you were going to suspect them.
Finland's gonna get you.
Somebody lies.
I'm pained by the right arm.
Tom, and only he can do it.
I didn't call you.
You ever learned, didn't you?
The kid's learning.
Tom is my friend.
I should be ready.
You want to do what he's named?
It's the first one who's going to do it.
Are you sure we've never met?
I want you to get here as soon as possible.
You should remove this pocket.
I did what was in my power to protect it.
You have to be here before half the third.
The bubble is also the main song of the group.
Why did you buy this car?

I don't recognize you on this.
Tom gave it a little tea shot.
Everything Tom foretold is done.
My father's in the hospital now.

It doesn't mean to save money.
We're his sons.
I hoped I'd find you.
Your letter comforted me.
I'm never paying.
I see you've got it all on the shot.
I'm not Czech.
Will he come?
We have to get out of it.
I'm satisfied with my payment.
There's nothing mysterious for this case.
We shouldn't have dinner.
What man is Tom?
I'll tell you.
She asked him for money to buy new clothes.
You have to have a big deal to add 10 thousand.
I haven't been like this anymore.
No one will do it for you.
Our cake dog started behind the big jealous.
Tom gave Mary a relatively difficult question.
I recommend you to take the train.
If there's a bad weather, we're not going to run.
Which road leads to the city?
There's a meloon on the table.
It's such winter!
It's been a week.
We both slept.
They're glad to consume olives.
All our efforts were disappointed.
I'm not going to do it, even if you'd put me on my knees.
Does your sister have your kids?
I want to know what you're doing here.
You didn't give Tom the chance.
Madrid is the main city of Spain.
You don't want to know why I didn't do it?
I could cry.
It seems that Friday of the 13th is a funny day.
Tom found an old camera on the ground.
She couldn't.
You should have been with us.

The beauty is just surface.
I like Tom.
Shut up the iron until it's crazy.

Where did you live?
Without water, it's not my life.
Tom certainly knows enough French to get enough.
Why didn't you do your home job?
Tom said it wasn't time to get out.
A man like you can't hurt me.
It's definitely like a rain.
What are we going to do then?
I didn't have that night anymore.
When did you first visit Australia?
Tom is suspicious of the misuse of children.
Did they serve you?
That's what a pleasant girl got out on the party.
"You're already finished?" "I'm not even starting."
What's the last thing you remember?
Down is a lady who wants to talk to you.
Tom's getting an invalid income.
Layla heard that sound.
Tom doesn't know all the names yet.
Don't get away, stay with me!
She's not a good man.
I've been studying French after four years.
Tom's the stupidest student in the class.

It's not on you.
I wanted to know when he would come back.
Everything he did was successful!
Tom has a big big bird.
Prohibited fruits are best pleasant.

I'm eating here.
Tom's running up to twenty cigarettes daily, while Mary's not going anywhere.
Tom and Mary worked in the same company for three years.
You're not going to kill Tom really, right?
These factors deteriorate the lives.

This girl isn't for you.
I'm enjoying Tom's company.
I'm pretty sure.
I know Tom's already done with that.

How could you betray me like that then to all of us?
Why would Tom go away?
My doors are open.
I bought two boxes of fire.
You didn't hurt anyone, didn't you?
Be careful about that kid.
Would you like that?
I'm paying that coffee.
Don't work on it.
I'm not taking such a weight.
Tom hit Mary.
Call her tomorrow.
I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were spirals.
They're playing home.
I don't know why I'm going on.
I'm not so executive as I was.
Tom's dog's kissed a few blinds.
Don't forget Tom's blind.
Mary looked like widows.
I'm sure you like no dishputate.
When Tom came home tonight, he found out that there was no dinner anymore.
He knows them.
They're sure too proud of their daughter.
Tom left right, and Mary went on the other side.
One kidnapped.
He started to explain what happened.
Tom's got a bullet from the lithium, he can eat almost anything.
Mother didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom's noticed how somebody stuck him to the rameno.
Do you know who these parents are?
No word will indicate how you are.
I'd like a fruit-scale.
He's gonna be crazy tomorrow?
The Clinical font found by Sumery was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I've got a year, but I can't keep it stuck.
Of course so!
Mary's got you.
What are you doing?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where were you all the afternoon?
You found a sympathic guy.
He did it from jealousy.
She was kidding her hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't be very normal to it.
I'm thinking I'll take a few days free.
Tom never talks French to me.
Tom's left highly cool on the table.
There's no beer over the glass after the whole day work.
She doesn't know anyone of us.
I'm happy to work up to this time.
Are you really helping?
To be you, I'll ask him.
Let them be for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's go out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even when they invited me.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were probably walking with Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery for me.
How nice you have a car! You've certainly paid a lot for it.
Tom obviously lies.
So right and right then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the coat?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you again.
Tom says he would never win.
Tom's gonna be three-thirds tomorrow.
Put the meat on the thick plates.
I can't see how it ruins his life.
Do everything with a pleasure.
I'm just buying a mild toilet paper.
Yeah, you have to.
We went out to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Remember what she was?
I'm too tired of that pack.
It's not easy to play a fagot.
She took the job just to comfort her husband.
Moscow is the main city of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was weakening the change of the subject.
We're drinking a lot of bird.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The old customs are dead today.
Tom still has a lot of job.
You should go out right now.
Tom's unkind.
Good reading.
We've cut the test.
I'm just here to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The tree had to stop because the tree was lying down on the railways.
What did Tom cry for the dav?
He's a perfect husband for me.
She's not like her older sister.
I brought you a dinner today.
We're going to festivals at the bones of the 17th century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I've been surprising Tom sometimes.
With a great effort, he went on the tree.
Translating Czech text is very hard.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We know everything, Tom.
I'm not that you warned me about it.
I left the dinner.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful tongue.
I'm not at home a week.
Who sent you there?
We had a sound manager in the neighborhood.
You're a good person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
He's aware of his power for this job.
They're falling down.
She was alone in darkness.
Tom wasn't weakening to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pearl?
They don't help.
I like these cravats.
We didn't know how good they wanted.
Please close on the door.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you talk to Joanna?
You don't deserve me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The cloud is covered with black darkness.
I need it more than you.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave him a glass.
What should I do in this?
You're going to school to the train?
Tom's at school today.
I'm crazy on Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It might be Tom for that, not Mary.
What if you invited me to the glass?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
She's deceived?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.
I don't know what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me when that happens.
He's free.
These people don't usually say this.
Ask your mother.
Tom was carefully kissing his feet.
Did you eat tonight?
John was happy as a bleach when she got a recording with.
I'd like you'd go with us.
He's spent a lot of time at his computer.
They wouldn't have been in this campaign if you had helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's going to visit his uncle.
Everyone's outside.
Tom couldn't hear that, but Mary yes.
I can give you the autogram if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could someone live in such a place?
It's been two days ago.
I know exactly what's going on.
Did you ever sing in French?
I'm usual for this cold weather.
The Americans surprised Germans.
There's not enough chair in the conference room.
Tom wasn't nervous anymore.
I told Tom that he was a fake friend and he was hurt.
Peru's cut it up.
This pool was freed by the pool.
He's kidding her.
I've been late to school today.
I've participated in the watching.
I went straight to bed.
We've been shot at the river.
Tom never drinks a strong alcohol.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my back is international.
You've got a problem, I want to think what.
Tom fell Mary in his hand.
I'm alone fully happy.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I'm not going there.
Tom played with Mary Tenis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
They stood in the middle of the walls.
I talked English to them, and I found that I could talk to them.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did somebody talk to you with Tom?
You should apologize.
The floor's freshly covered.
She knows who you are.
Let's see her.
Well, you'll be sorry about it.
You've been crazy.
They had to win.
All responses must be written in accordance with the instructions.
Answer me questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I can't let my mouth open.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking I'm going to divorce her.
I bought myself a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Did you agree?
There were no doubts.
I don't want someone else to read it.
I don't know he's not married.
I can't tell Tom anything wrong.
Stay there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own legs.
When we saw what Tom had on it, we got a laugh.
Tom's wrong, right?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed that the wedding would be released.
If I was with you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's whisper.
I've loaned Tom's ass.
I'm crazy.
I'm writing my covenant.
I'm no longer such a cockpit.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she's not alone.
Tomorrow, we'll go to the coast.
Try talking to the police.
You like slone.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll get something to drink.
Do you have a jahode?
She was older.
I guess he's gone home.
I was in the forest.
Tom's drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd like to go back inside.
She doesn't have to do it.
I know she's nice.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
He has his own house.
I'm usually not doing that tonight.
Why do you want me to ask for help if we can do it alone?
I was waiting for them to say the truth.
Put it under the corner.
I'm so nice you're here.
She's deceived.
Tom didn't want Mary to lose.
Tom's home.
Get the balloon to Tom.
I'll hurt her.
Was the police involved in that?
We've got kids.
I'd like to be a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom has to share.
You should consult a lawyer before.
You're a good newsman.
That's what Tom's usual.
I love this book.
The waste is stuck again.
When I came home from the work, I found that someone didn't help us to stay.
Read the book.
This was a peker.
My father's running a restaurant.
You're really naked.
I don't have any movies.
This works.
Leave the fucking.
I'd like to do more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can this message be true?
Easy hit, easily deceived.
Do you think you've seen me?
Help, but now I'm busy.
If I didn't help her, I would never put the test.
You wouldn't be more happy if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people waited for him.
Tom said Mary wasn't planning to go with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
The promise seemed unexpected.
If you need more information, please don't care to answer me.
When you come here, I'll sleep.
I don't know how Tom's old.
I want you to go with me.
I told Tom that it wasn't done yet.
Judy's got him.
Tom and Mary met John.
Please, don't do that.
You're gonna be happy again.
The kid went after four.
Tom's not taking his medicines.
"You didn't see my mobile?" "He's on the table."
Tom went to his box.
It's been wrong with the spring.
Noah, let's get to eat.
They had to give him a gift.
In England the chief asked us "How many birds would you give, half pinty or all?" Because we had no idea how much it could be, we asked him to show us the glasses.
I'll tell Tom that you'll get a trailer.
I prefer English than music.
I have a fish.
They're all crying.
Toma's parents supported his study.
He's getting a sense of morality.
If you'd have a lot of pressure, don't worry about coming after me.
He's cruel and unfair, and people's going to face him.
He was killed by Laila himself.
You're crazy.
He's too self-conscious.
The companies may have to lose some jobs.
He wasn't running enough to get the train.
I've been doing here sometimes.
I'm hungry.
He's met a lot of people who've been disappointed.
Nobody's here.
She's married at 17 years.

When's the breakfast starting?
Are you here?

She first met him in Boston.
Did you have a weekend?
He visited Japan when he was the president.
I knew Tom was gonna smile.
We're going to break these bags.
He's not alone anymore.
That's what I doubt.
Tom's unusual.
I don't know how to keep up.
Tom's still a young man.
I could have used to live here.
They wanted to sell a house.
You know how to use it?
The boy's strong.

What's up to me?
Tatoeba is a drug.

Tom's making the lamps.
Don't try to live too much, you don't make it.
It wasn't so easy as I thought.
She brought something to you.
Why don't you just get the mouth to Tom?
He's drunk.
He threatened to kill her if she didn't listen to him.
I'd like to be in Paris now.
You remember that?
I live in Turkey.
I don't want to disappoint my friends.
Mary's a very busy woman.
I don't know anything anymore.
Hungry and hungry, we finally reached the host.
It's not important, isn't it?
Can't you bring me a deck?
You're a good kitchen, right?
I just wanted to say thanks.
Who's going to pay for that?
Don't trust it.
She wasn't winter.
Tom asked Mary to make him coffee, and Mary told him to make it alone.
They asked if they could write a new word.
He's planting the races in the garden.
Many people don't have a hospital.
Would you give me a milk glass?
Tom read the magazine when he waited for Mary until she appeared.
My name is Ivan.
I'm never going to get to it.
Be glorious.
It's not the size of what it cares, it's a way of use.
It seems to be aware.
Don't tell me if you'll need anything.
I've already done it.
Tom has three elderly brothers.
He's a big guy at the glory.
I burned my fingers on a crazy throat.
Tom forgot the money at home.
We've already done our share.
I don't want to wait.
Tom said we'd have more job positions.
What a beautiful spirit!
You've already forgotten.
Where's Daddy?
How did those bombs get off?
Tom said Mary shouldn't try to do it alone.
Tom had clothed white trick.
I think you could help me.
Can you update our programs?
They can't have hungry, he just ate.
Tom's going to Boston next year.
Let me help you.
Tom didn't know who I could go.
Tom didn't know if that was true.
Let's go, or the bus will join you.
I know it's hard to see.
Give me the kidneys.
I thought Tom would do it for us.
You have to finish it.
He's getting you out of your mouth.
And the story has always changed.
Smoke the lips and cut off the sticks.
A man's work is listening.
Sometimes I feel we're a people of burbans.
I'm almost twice as old as you.
There's nobody in the office at the moment.
How can I sacrifice in something I don't believe?
Who wants another piece of the dark?
It's too soon to sleep.
That's what they left waiting.
What when they asked Tom?
I was very excited.
He loved her to bury her hands.
Tom's explanation wasn't too good.
I don't want to go to school.
Make sure you're not going to a bad bus.
Tom visited Mary in the hospital.
I can't live alone.
All these three beautiful girls are my nephew.
Try this!
I loved you more than anyone else loved you.
You want me to put it on the table?
He eats.
He won't let me go.
You can get on him.
You lost your head, right?
Tom's putting a wall.
He was tired and so he went to sleep quickly.
Why are people afraid of you?
Tom's got the animals.
It's a car that's real.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
How did that feel?
Insensitivity in young people is supported by violent movies and computer games.
Some criminals will stay uncovered.
Tom's got a bag.
Tom's waiting.
I don't deserve your friendship.
Tom was crazy.
I can't leave you.
Nobody's getting it yet.
Meat and silver are both metals.
Put it on me.
We got another chance.
Did you ever have been in Okinawa?
This is the best restaurant in Tokyo.
Stay home.
Tuberculosis patients were sent to special diseases called sanatorium.
Tom must be crazy.

It's disgusting some of the public.
The underground is the main city of Black Hory.
Two feet, one road.
He went to America last week.
Tom has nothing to do with that.
Hey, bitch!
That's not true.
I can't blame you for the violation of your promise.
It doesn't pay me for this.
How do we know Tom says the truth?
And they won.
It's Tom's fault.
If you didn't get so much, you wouldn't be so sleeping now.
The accident occurred because of Tom's opaqueness.
It wasn't the way we hoped.

Tom didn't do anything to help me.
My sister's a journalist.
I'm a visit.

Tom's not so rich as his friends think.
Get it off!
Give me that book.
Or would it be like sleeping?
Try to have a little compassion.

How can I perfect my English? What a easy way to win it is to improve it?
I'm glad to eat.
No, you don't have to get away right now.
Destroy your enemies. Make your friends of them.
What did you learn?
I discussed it with Tom.
I wonder I've read the book.

Good to see you.
Armed industry brings profits, but also suffering.
I need color pieces.
I'll get my dog back to the treasure.

They're used to work hard.
It's totally on Tom.

She was walking with him.
Tom told me Mary's in the campaign.
You've got comics on the pockets.

I'm worried.
Is Tom innocent or guilty?
The doors won't even move.

She asked him not to go there.
Tom didn't tell his parents where he was.
You can't leave because the doors are locked.
Tom should have been outside and playing with the final kids.
She kept him for his hand.
It's not for Tom.
I'm unemployed.
Tom laughed on Mary when she came in.
It seems you're happy with yourself.
How many times in the month you're getting out of your car?
Everything Tom said is true.
Randing may be terrifying.
You just kicked my leg.
Tom's too proud to ask for help.
Tom said I'm sick.
The city of Hungary is Budapest.

I'm not listening to your voice.
It's damn you couldn't come.

You don't know that everything I have is yours, too?
I'm absolutely sure Tom says the truth.
It was a special look in front of my eyes.
I have time.
The man is set on the top of the food string.
I'm more teacher than writer.
I think you know what I mean.
Tom was forced to leave.
I'm afraid it's gonna be crazy tomorrow.
I'm Ir, but I don't know Irish.
I understand what you're trying to do, but it's gonna work.
I've returned where it belongs.
What is it replaced?
Would you like one?
This car is not mine.
We've never chosen.
Finally, I came with a great idea.
I'm so sorry.
I'm glad to sleep.
She laughed.
The doctor's working in the hospital.
I don't have you so much to walk with you.
They split the fire to burn.
Tom never got recognition for anything.
Because I was the one they saw, they could think I was the one who did it.
I told Tom that Mary wouldn't accept a gift.
Copy a little more.
Tom ever eat meat.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I want to be the worst.
He hates me if I wake you up.
I'm pretty sure.
It doesn't seem to like Tom here.
I'd like to be more favorite.
My uncle gave me a book.
I'm on this job a new guy.
I should have continued.
Why don't anyone want to talk about that?
I'd like to be so young as you.
You know who broken the window?
They're afraid of me.
It was my obligation to do.
Do you really want to stay young?
I'll be underground.
We'll have to find a new place soon.
You're always going to your husband.
Learn Hungarian.
I'll go with you to the bridge.
It's been good.
Tom had to feed more.
You wouldn't believe what people's going out.
I understand you have two citizens.
He has a long nose.
I'm waiting for you.
He was very drunk.
That can be a good idea to start right now.
Wait here, please.
I've got a big hot.
Tom was getting on me to the boss, he'll be sorry.
Tom decided to do that.
They've got us to be stupid.
Everyone's bad.
You have to believe it.
The cow is a useful animal.
Success usually requires hard work.
Where do you have the keys from the car?
I'm wearing flane pijamas.
It was his last dinner.
I'm not insane at all.
Tom can't help me today.
She cared about a sick father.
I'm not going to do it again.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
"Is this a meal?" — "All is eating — at least once."
His house is on sale.
If you show me your tongue, maybe I'll show you myself.
I forgot everything about it.
Why didn't you come before?
You shouldn't go through it.
I don't know her name.
How can I lose?
I'm the one who usually cares for the family.
Let's go out.
Something inspired me.
Did you see my pen?
Marie is Tom's non-profit sister.
Mary's more honest than Tom.
You're prosecuted for this sentence.
Don't say hop until you're running.
Can't you help Tom?
That's quite unusual.
You should apologize.
I read that President of Brazil is a woman, named Dilma.
He himself needed psychiatric help.
My sister works in a secretary.
It's my job to convince you.
I'm not trying to preach.

Don't let me wait like this.
The room is dark.

Success results from effort.
I don't have your friend.

That's how I know you love Tom.
He's not on the side.
He never forgotten me for anything.
There's a lot of beautiful girls around the world.
I have no art.
I don't think he's coming.
I'm going to overcast the advertising in the video whenever I can.
They're running.
Your opinion isn't counted.
Agressive drivers who do not maintain safe distance are a danger for a wide public. The unsecure distance is a type of agress after the caller.
Tom hasn't got my trust yet.
Don't go on a broken glass.
It's all the time.
You can't kill me.
I brought a friend.
I didn't know Tom couldn't fly.

It's brilliant.
Remember what I told you?
We like Tom.
Don't be courageous, Mike.
I liked Tony.

Tom, don't leave me!
I'm starting to understand.
Tom seemed to be kind.
It seems to be too dangerous.
I don't care about details.
He should've come here.

It seems that I've done all this freely.
Yes, both words have the same meaning.
I can't give it to them.

Tom cooked.
I'm trying to do it.
Your offer is very attractive, but we'll have to think about it.
Save these glasses, please.

What else do I have to do to get your trust?
Can you update my program equipment?

You had me sometimes.
It's as if it belongs to him.
Tom was mild.
To say the truth, I don't have Tom.
Tom said it wasn't his obligation to take care of Mary.
He wants patience, do it.
If Mary had told what Tom was to be a shit, she would never take him.

I want a coffee.
I think you're losing time.
He's got some animals.

Unfortunately, I can't tell her.
They cried.
I haven't seen this for a long time.
You were running so much as it happened.
I've never seen it really.
I don't want to live with you.
Tom told me Mary hate.
I'm not able to tell you what happened.
Theory is generally accepted.
It's the worst.
I did what I could to stop Tom.
Africa is a continent, Greenland not.
He's so fucking!
I've just understood what Tom thinks.
I think Tom's leading me to the nose.

The situation changed.
We've been talking about a few options.
I'm a hero.
When we're together, it looks like the time's stopped.
I'll call her right now.
Do you like my bubble?
What did they do to him?
This is a much more natural way to make a word resource.
What would you do if you were in my place?
I love the sound of church calls.
Where's the boy?
The truth is that I don't know French anyway.
Bring it in here.
You better ask Tom.
Be in the watch.
