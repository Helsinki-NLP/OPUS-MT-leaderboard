white foot on f3, black foot on e6, white foot on g4, black hole on h4 - math! In shaching circles it is called "bug math".
White: boats on a1, foot on b6, king on c8. Black: feet on a7 and b7, king on a8, slone on b8. The white boat puts a sugzwanga in the position of a6, then there are only two options for black: take a boat to a6 or move the slone to any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the white boat moves a foot from b6 to b7 and makes math. In the second case, the white boat will take the black foot on a7 with the same result.
