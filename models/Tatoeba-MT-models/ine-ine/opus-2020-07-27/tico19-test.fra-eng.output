Quick increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/The European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence in cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar development in the countries of the European Union/the European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemy is quickly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must be prepared for a few patients with COVID-19 needing care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an unknown ethology pneumonia house was reported in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Prevention and Control Centre appointed the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known under the name of Coronavirus 2 of the severe acid respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been baptized with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Today, approximately 80% of COVID-19 persons have a blessed affection, i.e. an infection of respiratory paths with or without pneumonia, most of them are healing.
In approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 has a severe incidence in hospitalisation, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a serious form of illness needing intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In the framework of this study, we evaluate the development of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/the European Economic Area (EU/EE) and the United Kingdom (R.U.), and compare it with the development of the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EE countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Case of COVID-19 in the EU/EE and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemy in the rest of the world is currently following the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemy.
In the Edition of the Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Spiteri and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe after WHO case definition.
Inside the EU/EEE, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 countries of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom (R.U.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1 727 stated deaths, including 17 750 cases and 1 441 deaths only for Italy.
Obtaining the cumulative number and the cumulative incidence of the case of COVID-19
The number of cases reported in COVID-19 in each country throughout the world is only obtained from official sources such as health ministers, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHOs.
These data were used to evaluate the development of COVID-19 within the EU/EE and the United Kingdom, and to set a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to evaluate the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we have calculated the cumulative impact at 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural development of COVID-19, within each EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country from 15 March 2020 to 8 hours to 8 hours with Italy's data for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom
The development of the 14-day impact of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EE countries and the United Kingdom has usually followed the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EE and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This evolution was mainly due to the rapid development of the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the cumulated impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 contains the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom in comparison with Italy's data for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
On 15 March to 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom have already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks ago.
Our results indicate that the number of cases reported in COVID-19 rapidly increased within the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom.
The development of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that pandemy progresses at a comparable speed in all countries.
And this is, despite the fact that the countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national health services, potential variables in the definitions of cases and differences in the patient selection protocols to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, including for rattrapage tests.
Start March 2020, Italian doctors indicated that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the adoption of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEE scale for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (non-presented data).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complete the current monitoring data on the number of cases reported and death.
A study carried out in 2010-11 has shown a significant difference in the number of beds available in the intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, from 29.2 beds for 100.000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100.000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelization scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 associated with a risk & gt; 90% over the intensive bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid evaluation of the EESCM risks related to COVID-19.
Since the cases were still grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally collect a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should be set at the level 2 of the Statistical Territory Units nomenclature (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and the current development in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemy is quickly progressing within the EU/EE and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore be prepared for a supported Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 needing care, particularly intensive care, such as in Italy.
As stressed by the recent rapid evaluation of the risks of the CEPCM, a quick, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to sustain the propagation of the SARS-COV-2, with a approach to an attainment approach, as far as the quick and recent number of cases may not allow sufficient time to deciders and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented above.
The rapid risk assessment also reflects health measures to reduce the impact of pandemy.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to enhance the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without prejudice, the health systems of other EU/EEE countries should be addressed to a few patients needing intensive care in the next days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavir disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by coronavir 2 of the severe acue respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has even caused more than 3.000 deaths and infected more than 80.000 people in China and else in the world, causing humanitary disaster.
As its approved, the SARS-CoV, which led thousands of SRAS cases in 2003, could be transmitted by the SRS-CoV-2 chains and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 presents a smaller severity and mortality than the SRAS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people than younger and more men than women.
In response to the rapid reporting of the number of publications on this emergency disease, this article strives to provide a suitable and exhaustive examination of this research subject in full-term.
We will address epidemiology, ethology, virusology, treatment, pronostic and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this exam will participate in better learning and eliminating this serious disease.
The Premium Festival, on 25 January 2020, marked forever the Chinese, who had been forced to remain closed for the entire week of gold and for long-term weeks because of the propagation of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly approved to coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe acue respiratory syndrome epidemic (SRAS) in 2003; therefore SARS-CoV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the disease associated with coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and rapidly spread to the whole China before it spread nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients who had been hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.europabi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 travellers were held on the COVID-19, especially in the areas of virology, epidemiology, ethology, ethology, and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, isolated from several patients.
This examination tries to syntheze the progress of research on this new subject in full sense.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another Coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic occurred in 2012).
We will also take the point of what we have learned in terms of prevention and prevention of disease, and we will address some questions still in suspension but even urgent.
Coronavirus are traditionally considered as non-mortal patogens for humans, mostly caused by 15% of the common rains 4.
However, during this century, we met two highly pathogen coronavirs for the Human, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused a epidemic starting in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with a high morbidity and a high mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemy of coronavirus in the recent history.
As presented in Fig.1.1., pneumonia houses were reported at Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of coronavirus was discovered.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbors.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in 40% with an interruption of its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly contacted with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, considered as the outcome point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of this report, the disease has already been spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries throughout the world (Fig.2).
As the situation quickly develops, the final and severity of epidemia remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study conducted from 8 866 patients, with 4 021 cases confirmed by COVID-19, presented an updated view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all age, but mostly in the 30-65-year-old range.
Nearly half (47.7 per cent) of infected people were older than 50 years, very fewer than 20 years, and only 14 were less than 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and in periferia.
The average duration between the appearance of symptoms and the COVID-19 appearance was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC 95 %: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially up to 23 January 2020, which coincides with the massive movements that occurred before the Premium Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% IC: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality of patients was 3.06% (95% IC: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus constitutes a subfamily of largely developed viruses containing a simple RNA.
They can be classified in four types, namely alpha, beta, and delta, the coronavirus with ́ to infect the man belonging to the alpha and beta types.
The envelope Spike (S) contains the enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell recipients for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membranary fusy occurs.
The viral RNA geneome is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genetic RNA accompanied by enveloping glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms of vescicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was established as a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity between 10 dry samples taken on the original site of the epidemia, the Huanan sea fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is geneticly closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By means of the transmission electronic microscope, parts of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in ultrafine sections of human respiratory epitelium.
Human ACE2 was identified as a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 protein S lies to the ACE2 humans less than the SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in the virus pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, orf8 does not contain functional areas or motives with.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., presented the full human ACE2 cryo-ME structure with a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the transporter of amino acids B0AT.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was gathered in a form of dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two proteins S, which provides indications for coronavirus infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the removing of medicines in order to eliminate the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were coming from shoes and that they were transmitted to the Human through the civets and camelides respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the shoes have been advanced as the SRS-CoV-2 Native host, since the new virus is 96 % identical to the two SRAS coronavirs from the sorcers called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to broke the barry of species to infect the Human remain unknown, and the way of transmission is still to be elected.
Ji, and al., issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to the man by the serpents, which would include an approved recombination in the protein S.
According to a study conducted by Guangzhou researchers in China, the pangolin - a long muscle mammifer that feeds, often used in Chinese traditional medical medication - may be the intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homeology at 99% between a cronavirus covered by the pangols and the SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % between two genes is a difference of importance; therefore, the results should be expected to establish specific evidence (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
The SARS-CoV-2 would be sensitive to ultraviolet radians and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, ethatha to 75%, chloride-based defectives, peractic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, could effectively inactive virus.
The population hum's in its inhabitants is generally immunity in SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to other coronavir studies, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Generally, when a virus infects a host, it is recognised by the inner immune system through molecular motivation recipients (PRR), including type C lectine recipients, Toll (TLR), NOD (NLR) recipients and RIG-I recipients (RLR).
By various ways, the virus indicates the expression of flush factors, the maturation of dendric cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the propagation of the virus and accelerate the makro-phagocytose of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow virus to escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response will join the fight against virus.
Lymphocytes T, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in defense.
Cells T CD4+ stimulate cells B that produce specific antibodies of virus, and T CCD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammator cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a repeated patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an immune system reaction causes a localised explosion of the number of free radicals, which can cause serious injury to lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisceral failure, even death.
Infection in SARS-CoV-2, characterised by a home appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comerbidities and encessant women.
It is carefully admitted that persons exposed to a large number of viruss or whose immune functions are compromised are more risked to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days after a study on the 425 first cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted in 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average, for a bottle from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described below, concluded with an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) after a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of the 40% after a more precise incubation period, in order to avoid that infected but asymptomatic persons transmit the virus.
Generally, the persons exposed to, or infected by, the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the 40th be extended at 24 days?
The fever is often the first and main symptom of the COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not other symptoms such as a dry tough, a slaughter, muscle pain, a hot pain, a head pain, a gorge pain, a rhinoree, a thoracic pain, a diarrhee, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had a dyspnee and/or hypoglycaemia one week after the disease occurred.
As regards serious cases, patients quickly developed a water respiratory syndrome, a sectical shock, metabolic acid and coagulopathia.
Patients with hepatic and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with a water heat, even in the absence of thoracic radiography anomalia, must be tested for the virus in order to enable a preliminary effect.
A demographic study conducted by the end of December 2019 showed that the patients had 98% fever, 76% dry rate, 55% dyspnee and 3% diarrhee; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar conclusions were reported by two recent studies conducted on a family and on a home after transmission of virus from a asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), a dry tow (47%) and a dyspnee (55%).
However, 80% needed a ventilatory assistance, whether more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher letality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
A diarrhee (26%) and a gorge disorder (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
As regards the SRAS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), a dry rate (29-75%), a dyspnee (40-42%), a diarrhee (20-25%) and a throat disease (13-25%) and a ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
On 14 February, COVID-19's mortality was 2%, for 66 576 globally confirmed cases.
Similarly, the SRAS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8 096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, after a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality was 37% for 2 494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence range (IC) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of the SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table
The following data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less letal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemies.
The appearance of a house often intervenes within a family or within a race or a vehicle, such as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or have been contacted with infected persons or patients within two weeks with symptoms.
However, it was shown that individuals may be virus portors without so much to present symptoms for more than two weeks and that restabilised patients may be renewed to virus portors, which highlights the need to increase the duration of carant.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of periferic white globules (including limphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphophenie with a number of white globules < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of apartate aminotransferase and a viremia were identified in 1 099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had hepatic enzymes, muscular enzymes and high myoglobin in the blood, and most of them had a high level of C-reactive protein and erythrocytr sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dumer, a degradation product of fibre present in the blood was high, and the number of limphocytes was gradually decreased.
In most patients with COVID-19, an inequality of bilateral shadows or an opacity of glass in powder is detected.
Patients often develop atypic pneumonia, water pulmonary lesion and water respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously compromising gas exchanges.
Disfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to low surface rate and increased surface pressure, thus reducing the capacity of pulmonal pumps to gone and increased the risk of lung-apsus.
Thus, the most concerned toracic examinations often coinciden with the most severe form of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a disquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymfocytary infiltration and the presence of multi-nucleated synthetic cells in the pulmons of a patient who died from disease, which coincides with the virus infection and SDRA pathology and appears to patients with SRAS and MERS.
The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a reaction in polymerase after inverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, the clinical manifestations began to be used for ́c (which then was not only based on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
Similar situation was observed for the SRAS.
Therefore, combination of medical anticipations, clinical manifestations, laboratorial tests and radiological tests is essential and implicit to establish an effective.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SHERLOCK technology utilisation protocol based on CRISPR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allowed to identify SARRS-CoV-2 synthetic fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) with a reactive bandel for less than one hour without needing sophisticated equipment.
It is expected that this new technology will enhance consideration and practicality, if its use on clinical specifics had been concluded.
As a result of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments already used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table2).
These treatments include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressors, steroides, restabilised patients plasma, Chinese medical and psychological support.
Even the plasma of retable patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies all use to develop antibodies and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily attacked on poultry in the first time and probably, in a small measure, on other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the renal system.
However, disfunction and respiratory insufficiency constitutes the main threat for patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to weaken the symptoms and save life; it includes general oxygenotherapy, high-debit oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, severity of disease.
Patients suffering from serious respiratory symptoms must receive extra-corporal membrane oxidation (OMEC), a cardiopulmonary deficiency technique used for treatment of heart or critical respiratory insufficiencies.
Moreover, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sectical chocks, as well as protection of the functions of living organs, are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It was found that immune reactions cause cytokinic choice in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinic chock is a form of systemic fluctuation response characterized by freedom of all the cytokines, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNa, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic chocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroides and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal anticorps were used to treat cytokinic chocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic chocks include the modulation of the immune response by cells T, the IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines blocking, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS to reduce the severity of fluctuating lesions.
However, high-dose steroides have not been beneficial on severe lung lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to severe secondary effects, including a avascular osteonecrose, which thus affects the pronocy.
However, the recourse to short short-dosis corticosteroid cycles was recommended for patients with a serious form of COVID-19.
At the time of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed yet.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, an nukleosid analogue, has been effective in a American patients with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed from Gilead for treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Then the remdesivir also showed a possible inhibition of other virus to simple RNA, including MERS and SRAS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the composite to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Moreover, baricitinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
A diarrhee, nausea, vomiting, hepatic lesions and other side effects may occur after a combination of therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma repeated patients and anticorps production
Collection of blood in patients who have been healed of a convulsional disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an anti-traditional practice.
In fact, repeated patients often have relatively high rate of anticorps against pathogen.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by limphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they have unique moles in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was thus extracted from blood from a COVID-19 group of patients who were healed and injected to 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, with a decrease of the inflammation phenomena, a decrease of the virus burden and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to offer this method for a large-scale use until no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given therapeutic effects, some inconvenients associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune response and cause a symptom of freedom of cytokines, potentially fatal.
The blood anticorps concentration is usually low, and plasma request to treat severely sick patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells of rehabilitated patients and identify genetic codes with relevant antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of virus.
This would enable rapid increase in the production of anticorps.
MTC has been used since thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are widely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the MTC theories.
Most effective components remain a little or not at all in the measure where it is difficult to extract them and check them, or to know their optimal aspects.
Currently, because of the absence of a specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with moderate or severe disease symptoms.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best healing rates of the COVID-19 were observed in China provinces with 87 per cent of their patients, including the province of Gansu (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the province of Hubei, which had only 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, represented the lowest healing rate (13 per cent).
However, this is an appealing comparison, since many other effect factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its employees had a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (MO) and a combination of MO and MTC associated treatment.
The time of return at a normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the hospitalisation duration was just shorter for the MO+MTC group than only for the MO group.
More impressive, the rate of increasing symptoms (severe) was just lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% against 46.2%) and the mortality was less than for the MO+MTC group only (8.8% against 39%).
However, MTC's efficiency and innocuity remains to be defined by higher-scale controlled tests and in more centres.
It would also be interesting in characterizing the action mechanism and clarifying the effective components of MTC treatments or their treatments, if possible.
Individuals identified as cases of COVID-19 are usually anxious about this highly contagious and mortal disease, and those placed by quarantière also experience anxiety, singleness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxie and tough, as well as the adverse effects of the treatment, such as the insomnia induced by corticosteroides, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the first times of SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crisis, psychomotive excitation, psychotic symptoms, a water confusional state and even self-suicide trends.
Obliged research on contacts and enforcement, in the response to health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to certain faults against the effects of the county, the 40th and the stigmatization of their family and friends.
Hence, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as cases, people in contact with these populations and any other person in trouble.
This psychological support must include training of multidisciplinary teams, communication with regular and specific updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reserves and human beings infected to vulnerable hosts, and are often supplementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemies caused by emergency virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines in order to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo efficiency of these potential vaccines in elderly and on the models subject to letal provocation and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have been initiated yet.
This is probably due to the fact that the SRAS exited 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
However, MRS's sporadic cases and houses continue to be stated in the Middle East and in other regions due to the sustainability of zoonotic sources in endemical areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticules, particulates appearing to the virus and recombinant protein sub- units, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, it is a real challenge due to the important period (18 months in average) necessary to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronavirus.
In the case of an emerging disease, COVID-19 just starts its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, sick people gradually rebuild without sekels.
However, as regards SRAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high mortality and more serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a model of pronocy is essential to ensure that health agencies can prioritize their services, in particular in the areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies, factors that may affect or be associated with COVID-19 patients are the following (Table (Tabelle33):
Age: Age was the main factor for the SRAS pronocy, and this is also the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects 30-65-year-old individuals, with 47.7% more than 50 years, a study conducted in 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to present subjacent complications and complications, and were rather older (66 years older than 51 years old), thus suggesting age as a pronostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 needing intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart lesions and arithmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is necessary to note that the age and the presence of subjacent health problems are strongly corrupt and can interfere with each other.
Anormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissual lesions; it has been advanced as a potential pronostic factor of disease, response to treatment and treatment.
Correlation between the CRP rate and the severity as well as the COVID-19 project has also been proposed.
Moreover, a high rate of dehydrogenate lactate (≥H), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and kinase creatinine (CK) can also participate in establishing the pronocy.
These enzymes are largely expressed within several organs, especially at the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissual lesions.
Therefore, they are traditionally cardiac or hepatic dysfunction markers.
High clinical symptoms: the results of the toracic radiography and the time progress of the clinical symptoms must be examined in ↓ with the other elements for the determination of the pronocy and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroides: as described below, steroides are immunosuppressors commonly used in the treatment of infectional diseases to reduce the severity of fluctuating lesions.
Since the use of corticosteroides has been widely used for SRAS serious cases, many surrounders have presented a avascular osteonecrose resulting in permanent incapacity and medium-life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, administration of steroides to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to low dose and short-term.
As described above, COVID-19 epidemic has caused a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients often knowing long terms of 40%, extreme incertainty, and the death of neighbors or other patients.
It is important to propose psychological companionship and long-term support in order to help those people overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to the demographic studies made up to this day, the COVID-19 presents different epidemiological characteristics of SRAS.
In addition to responding to the lower respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 also reacts effectively in the higher respiratory paths and does not train or little symptoms in the first phase of infection, as coronavirus originating in common rains.
Therefore, recently infected or incubated individuals may produce a large quantity of virus during their daily activities, which prevents the control of epidemia.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients seriously sick, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than the SRAS.
Great efforts are currently developed in China, including Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuation of the almost total population in order to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other countries, the number of new cases decline, indicating the increase in the epidemic.
The most optimist estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decrease phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, all experts do not share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., believes that COVID-19, which is just more infectious than SRAS, will not be removed in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., set a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the prospects of the average nasal corne and the goat of repeated patients, 2 weeks after their outcome from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode in the way of the influenza.
However, encouragement signs were observed in China with progressive decrease of new cases, suggesting that implemented strategies would have worked.
According to the initial forecasts, Ebola virus had to lead to a million cases and a half million deaths.
However, thanks to a screening and a strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, as for the SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 delays in terms of infection to finally exit or develop in a less patogenic virus co-equivalent with the Human.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SRAS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by the towels or towels, and may also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in cells, thus showing a new potential for feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of the cases were likely caused by nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore necessary to take precautions to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, neighbors and sick people, and even any person who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible defense line to reduce the risk of infection resides in the face masks port; the use of chirurgical and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the propagation of virus.
Chirurgical masks prevent the design of potentially infected guittelets or their depth on surfaces, where they could be transferred to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5 % of the virons able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particules are able to cross five chirurgical masks empiled each other, health professionals in direct contact with patients have N95 masks (1860s) and not chirurgical masks.
Further than masks, health professionals must have adjusted isolation blows to further reduce the contact with virus.
Viruses may also infect a person by ocular way.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infectioned in SARS-CoV-2, even though he had a N95 mask; the virus could have penetrateed its body by eyes because of inflammation.
Hence, health professionals should also carry out transparent vials or protective bullets to the patients' contact.
For the populations of the regions affected or potentially affected, it is highly recommended to wash hands with a defective soap more frequently than ordinary, to remain limited to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to keep a distance of a meter with the sick.
These measures constitute effective means to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the propagation of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, has to have placed China in high warning status after SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Control and Prevention of diseases in Wuhan assured the population by claiming that the new virus was uncontact, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message led to a significant release, especially when the whole country was prepared for the Premium Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain disease in Wuhan was missing.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn and take the measures to be taken.
For example, these agencies (1) must be more implied in their announcements, since each word and may affect the behavior and the decisions of the population; (2) to demonstrate more intensity and reactivity towards clinical data rather than to expect formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) to be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning than to try to restore the population; and (4) to carry out more objective and relevant exercises in order to enhance the population on epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the society response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started in December 2019.
In less than two months, when the report was edited, it extended to China and nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemy is born as an impression of already-vi.
However, significant differences between COVID-19 and SRAS are observed, which should be taken into account in order to contain epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 more affects older people than younger and more men than women; severity and mortality rate are also more important in older people.
The SRAS presents more mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 % against 1.44 %).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is even possible in the absence of symptoms, while the SRAS was mostly transmitted by patients seriously sick; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the propagation of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests may be negative for certain patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, repeated patients may be positive again to virus.
This increases the risk of propagation.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain still in suspension, including:
Where's the SARS-CoV-2 coming from?
Although a genetic homologation of 96 % has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SRAS coronavirs from the shoes, it is not sufficient to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is a chiropter.
What is the intermediate species that has allowed the transmission of the virus of the original host, for example the bowls-souris, to the Human?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupt the transmission effectively, and the epidemic can recover at any time.
A molecular modeling and biochemical analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is located in the ACE2, but how does the virus fit exactly in the respiratory road cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also refer to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and precise or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemie take?
How does the virus develop geneticly during interhuman transmission?
Will he develop in global pandemy, disappear like the SRAS or regularly resume the surface like the grippe?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to answer these questions and to many others.
However, no matter what expenditure this must be induced, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible to restore the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is lower than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have had a severe infection of lower respiratory paths.
The first case of SRAS returns to end 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
Without counting super-transmittors, it was considered that each case could appropriately produce two secondary cases with a incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the viral burden pick appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgie, head pain, fever, sickness and freshness, dyspnee monitoring, tough and respiratory distress such as late symptoms.
Lymphophenie, faused hepatic function tests and high kinasis creatine are coherent analysis observed in laboratorium analyses in case of SRAS suspicion.
Diversed alveolary lesions, the proliferation of epitelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
About 20 to 30% of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to below respiratory paths, several organs including gastrointestinal, liver and renal paths may also be infected in these serious cases, often accompanied by cytokinic choice, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Several efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated at a 7-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjoitive, fever and bronchiolite is consistent in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a 8-month pneumonia-sufficient boy in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a obstructive laryngite, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated by a 71-year hospitalized man due to a pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
As of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs get the ability to effectively translate and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they become also less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS’s clinical manifestations react to SRAS and are characterized by a evolutive water pneumonia.
In contrast to SRAS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed a aquatic renal failure, which is the characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 cases confirmed in laboratorys were reported with a high death rate, or 34.4%, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most mortal viruses with humans.
A diarrhee is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected in SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to its rapid propagation in the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoV have shown very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoV.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the SARS-CoV and the four Community HCOV (hereinafter HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in case of infection in SARS-CoV, although the proportion is very lower.
Finally, as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be decelated in salt samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenicity and its sustainable distribution, will affect the final destination of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCOVs cause moderate symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be the surroundings of HCoV pandemies.
In order to achieve this, HCOVs must respond to humans in a sufficient proportion to enable the accumulation of adaptative mutations that implies the host's restriction factors.
In this optical, more the persist SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and more the number of infected people is important, more there are chances that the virus is totally adapted to humans.
If it is appropriate, it will be difficult to stop the transmission of men by a 40% or by other infection control measures.
Since many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been within the population, making a simple range of immuno-competitive subjects.
These viruses do not need animal reservation.
However, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission among men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread themselves in their zoonotic reservations and seek an opportunity to achieve potential humous targets, probably through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 provides similar characteristics as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four acquisitions in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoV acquisition in community and less patogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it will completely adjust to human beings and will be among those who have no animal host reserve or intermediate.
Before discussing animal origins of the HCoV, we will be useful to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, reserves, mediators and amplifiers of the HCoV.
A animal serves as a developing host of a HCoV if it opens a nearby ascender shareing high homologation at the level of nuclear sequence.
The original virus often was well adapted and is not pathogenic for his host.
Similarly, a reserve host opens the HCoV in a continuous and long-term way.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservation host.
In particular, since 80% of the Guangzhou market animals have antibodies against SARS-CoV, the possibilities that several species of small mammifers can also be used for amplifying hosts may not be excluded.
These cows are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and to the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have placed the foundations of a new concept, which is the hosts of human pathogens.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensin hum 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV recipient.
Despite a high homologation between these two viruses, the WIV1 is usually not the immediate parent of the SARS-CoV parent and the SARS-CoV shoes are not the host to reserve immediately SARS-CoV.
That's why the shooters can't be the host to reserve the MERS-CoV intermediate.
Furthermore, studies conducted in the Middle East showed that drugs were severe to specific antibodies neutralising MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating in several African countries.
Furthermore, infectioned camels excrete virus not only by respiratory ways but also by fecal way, which also constitutes the main way to excrete the hair-shirts.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
Recombination is an extensive factor of the development of beta-CoV.
Scientists are still divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be issued from the Cove-souris Cove, while the HCoV-OC43 parent viruss and HCoV-HKU1 were found at rounders.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was geneticly associated with another cove-souris cove, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while some camelides were also suspicious of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 broke the species barry to infect humans from the household beast to around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemy was reported.
The history of the interspective transmission of HCoV-229E is less.
Alpha-CoVs of the nearly HCoV-229E-souris have been found.
On the other hand, contrary to the alpagas, men may have a contact with the shoes-souris in a shared  géological nine.
On the contrary, people have close contacts with the alpagas.
Following this, the alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E-shirts are many and not pathogenic in the cows, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga caused a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, the hair-souris are the direct source of human pathogen virus, including rage virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that the shoes can send the HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the cow-souris uses genetic reserves of HCoV-229E, the alpagas and dromaders could use intermediate hosts transmitting virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspective transmission of honey-shirts to human drugs and drugs.
The evolutional origin of MERS-CoV found in the shoes is known by its initial identification and has also been strengthened by later covered.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the drugs for decades.
It was well adapted to these chambers that passed from a host-in-house to hosts to reserve stable natural reserves.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities of interspective transmission of human animals from SARS-CoV-2 have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the shoes-souris could be the host to reserve a virus appearing in SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share a Ethiopian nine with sorrows through the depth or carbon mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts with which a SRAS-CoV-2 virus has been recently introduced.
Humans are contracting the virus by depreciation and consumption of kidney meat.
Many mammifers, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that have been both contacted with the shoes and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared with other simple ARN viruses, the estimated mutation rate of the CoV could be considered as “measured” to “height” with a average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per site per year, and the CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of CoV are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
In relation to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already been adapted to another near human host.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this applies also to MERS-CoV, which was well adapted to drugs.
In theory, the genetic derivative is not worth making vaccines and antivirals against SARRS-CoV-2 short-term ineffective.
Thirdly, the CoVs change randomly and often model in the replication of the RNA through a single mechanism of "choice-copy".
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found at the same time for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for the CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and bathCoV-HKU9.
Interaction with host-wide interaction in connection with transmission
Besides these three viral factors above, the viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor that affects interspective transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive choice evidence during interspective transmission episodes.
In other words, these two replacements of amino acids may be key factors for human adjustment.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell recipient as SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30 % between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S means that the affinity of this protein S with the ACE2 hum· could have been changed.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates a ffinity 10 to 20 times higher than the observed between the ACE2 hum· and the SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting in determining whether another co-receptor can be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Excellently, HCoV-NL63 is also located in the ACE2 but with a different part of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV recipients, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetil acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV's natural reserves, such as shoes, drugs and rongers, could constitute a barrier for interspective transmission.
News HCoV emergence: return to the outdoor box
The diversity of the cow-souris CoVs provides many opportunities for new HCoV emergence.
In this regard, the cow-souris CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoV.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adjustment, since the SARS-CoV hair-shirts virus were isolated, but ORF8 different proteins were coded.
This deletion split ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressured as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and certain nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been demonstrated that the recombination episodes between different lines, which occurred in drugs in Saudi Arabia.
While a ORF4 could be observed in the hair-souris and camel virus associated with HCoV-229E, the alpaga alpha-CoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, generating a decayment of the reading frame.
Finally, the development of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their reservation hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when covs were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adjustment between the CoVs and the sulphurs.
It seemed to have been well adapted to the CoV of anatomic and physiological viewpoint.
For example, disturbances in the activation of the pro-inflammation response in the cow-shirts reduce effectively the pathology of the CoVs.
Furthermore, the high level of oxygen reactive deficits (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of cow-shirts could at the same time remove the CoV replication and affect the "relecture" by exoribonate, which would create a selective pressure and cause highly pathogenic viral socks when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic covs could also develop by recombination, providing the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for the adaptation of the host.
So this is not a hazard if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as shoes and camels.
They reply strongly without providing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic portfolio are resident and caused by severe infection cases in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic choc; more immune response is strong, more pulmonary lesions are severe.
However, in the asymptomatic portfolio, the immune response was recovered from the CoV replication.
The same immune response strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in at least in the previous phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
Moreover, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is disappearing in the shoes.
Following this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-CoV-souris cheese shared by 95% of nucleotic homologies with the SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a 96% of nuclear homeology shared with SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-CoVs of pangolin have been discovered similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin can be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoV of pangolin could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs were returned under the ramp fires due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists with the dromader for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, cow and milk for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the renewable MERS epidemies, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to elymone these viruses, new genotypes could exhaust and cause epidemies.
Many zoonotic CoVs are in nature.
In particular, the cow-souris CoVs, including the zoonotic potential, are very high.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce inutile contacts between human and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a county opportunity is present.
Continue monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand CoV and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemies.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent the viral zoonoses is to keep away from the Ethiopian nines of the natural reserve of zoonoses.
First, if a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to pangols, it would be interested in observating in which circumstances chains and pangolins could share the same steroid nine.
Second, if the shoes play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people are in contact with the swimming hairs.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of the real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, shoes and pangolins.
Which is a cow-souris, a pangolin or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parents' virus observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grippe or rubber, for example, by laying hands before touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth (c.-d. muscles).
The main medical goal of the hand washing is elym· patogenic agents (bacteria, virus or other microemes that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction of the propagation of influenza, coronavir and other infectious diseases; the prevention of diarrhea infections; the reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infantile mortality rate in households.
In developing countries, infantile mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behaviour changes, such as the lavage of hands to satan.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years, which makes approximately 1.8 million victims per year.
As a result, diarrhee and pneumonia result in the death of approximately 3.5 million children each year.
The lavage of hands also protects the empetigo, which is transmitted directly by contact.
Minor delegate effect, frequency lavage of hands can cover the skin by providing a skin dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that hand washing could lead to echema or dermatite at the level of hands, characterised by squamous skin and demangeases, especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsory sexual disorder (TOC).
The deparsition twice a year, associated with daily lavage of hands to saune and daily brossing of teeth with a fluored dentifrice, is in the heart of this national programme.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of science and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to solution and to increase solutionability.
Only water is not an effective cleaning for skin because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are hardly solved in water.
For its reusable nature, solid shame can be dealing with the issues of useful uses.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended deinfectants allows the use of anti-biotics in nature to target residents.
Thus, even if the sugars resisting antibiotics are not the fruit of the anti-bacterian sains, these could not be as effective as announced.
Besides the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, milk acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobian function, and other protective agents (alia, vitamins, menhol, plant extracts).A strict analysis of the Oregon University Health School indicated that the sains were as effective as the antibacterian sains intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hands.
The warm water used to wash the hands is not enough heavy to kill the tears.
The body temperature (37 °C) increases rapidly.
However, heat and soap water is more efficient than cold and soft water to eliminate natural oils of salt and soft oil.
But contrary to the popular faith, scientific studies showed that the use of tissue water did not contribute to reduce the microbian burden on hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a product of hygiene of non-water hands.
Most of them are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethane associated with a heating agent such as the carbon (acrilic acid polymer) for ≥ a ice, or a humectant such as glycerin, to make a liquid or mouse for a greater use facility and to reduce the ashing effect of alcohol.
The diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobian activity.The defectives for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol eliminate genes effectively.
Hydroalcool solutions kill the roughs, multiresistant steroids (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (as HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and champions.
Hydroalcool solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroentherite.A sufficient quantity of desinfecting for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used for good me or cover the two hands.
The accurate use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination of micro-emises; however, they do not have to replace a suitable lavage of hands unless you have water and water.
Frequent use of hydroalcool solutions may cause skin drying if the formula is not strengthened by emolynts and/or hydratants of the skin.
The efficacy of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by embracing glycerin and/or other emolynts in the formula.
In the clinical trials, hydroalcool solutions containing emolynts have just caused less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobian sains or detergents.
Alergic contact dermatite, contact urticator or hyperequity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcool solutions are rare.
Despite their efficiency, non-water products do not eliminate the organic materials presented on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why the defectives for hands are not as effective as the snow and water to avoid the propagation of many patogenic agents, since these are remaining on their hands.
The efficiency of deinfectants for no alcohol hands depends strongly on ingredients and formula, and has always been just lower than the alcohol and alcohol-based deinfectants.
Recently, the formulas using benzalconium chloride have shown a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobian activity after application, in the difference of alcohol, which are achieved after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
The census or the earth can be more effective than the only water but less than it knows.
Moreover, if the earth or the census are contaminated by microemes, it can increase the propagation of diseases rather than breathing it.
In the way of the sand, the census is also a defective agent because, in contact with water, it forms a alcaline solution.
WHO recommends the censure or sand as alternative to the sawn when it is not available.
I have hands with courant water tissue or cold.
The current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while the water temperature does not make differences.
Make a generous quantity of sunk on the hands by striking them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the angles.
The science removes the skin worms, and studies reveal that people have the tendency to wash their hands more carefully when they use satan than with only water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action to fracture grown fraction, which helps to eliminate the skin worms, and to flourish longer getting more wheat.
A lot of riding to coherent water.
Renacing in a stagnating water bassin can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean or free air.
The most commonly forgotten areas are powder, point, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the angles.
The artificial onions and the vernis with angles can have microemes.
A hydrated lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to wash the hands when the robet and/or the sand water is not available. For example, make the water of a bidon or a persuaded and/or use of the censure if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to economy water, such as the tippy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple cup that uses a suspended cross using a corn, and a pedal that allows to spend a small quantity of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective drying of hands is a essential part of the hygiene process of hands, but the best way to dry hands in the toilet is discussed.
Moreover, research suggests that paper-services are much more hygiene than electrical sugars than we are often found in the toilet.
Following the lavage and drying of hands at warm air-drought, it was shown that the total number of halts increased by average by 194% on the fingerprint and 254% on the powder.
Success in air-eye was a average increase in the total number of feeds on the fingers of 42% and 15% powders.
Following the drying of hands, the following variables were observed:
There are many different sugar-main manufacturers, and the sugar-main has been compared to drying with paper-services.
The washing of hands with disinfectant tabs is a alternative solution during movements, in the abstention of sand and water.
Hydroalcool solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that give reminders when the hospital staff forgets to wash his hands.
The pharmaceutical lavage of the hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generic quantity of sain and water or ice to mouse and break each part of the hands.
The hands must be breaked against each other by embracing between the fingers.
After drying, the cartridge must be used to close the robinet (and open the output door if appropriate).
The goal of washing hands in health structures is to recover pathogenic micro-emissions and avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before a aseptic gesture; and
All boys must be removed.
In the framework of this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and pre-braces to the cow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During the rince, we need to avoid that the water on the pre-braces falls down to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germes, it is preferred to wash your hands or to use an antiseptics for hands before and after being occupied with a sick person.
As regards the control of staphylococ infections in hospitals, the main benefits of hand was obtained in the first 20% of the lavage, and there were only few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand waste over 35%.
More research is needed to discover the most effective interventions in various health structures.
For example, in the major part of rural Africa, it is rare to find robots to wash their hands near private or private toilet, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be imputable to tennis habits, rather than to a lack of sand or water.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the promotion campaigns of hygiene of hands that are conducted in order to reduce infantile diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Lavage of Hands is another example of the campaign of employment that is pre-predicted to promote the development of behaviour.After the 2019-2020 coronavir pandemy, the CEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating the lavage of hands.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the lavage of the hands to the saune is just more profitable than other water and raising interventions.
At that time, most of the people still believed that infections were two of the feti-smalls called myasms.
For example, in Germany, the “good hand washing techniques ” were placed near towels and toilet toilet of office and airports.
The expression "laving their hands" refers to a person to assume the responsibility or to be compliant of something.
Furthermore, those who are authorised to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclinated to grant other compensatory measures of purification, such as the volunteer.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jewishism and Islam requires to wash their hands before and after each food.

Because it's the grippe season.
It should also be highlighted that the artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genetic genetics, which are very probably followed by the pressures exercised in the selection, especially by the host's immune system.
For example, the total ORF4 loss of the HCoV-229E prototype can be quoted due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While a ORF4 could be observed in the hair-souris and camel virus associated with HCoV-229E, the alpaga alpha-CoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, generating a decayment of the reading frame.
Finally, the development of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their reservation hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when covs were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adjustment between the CoVs and the sulphurs.
It seemed to have been well adapted to the CoV of anatomic and physiological viewpoint.
For example, disturbances in the activation of the pro-inflammation response in the cow-shirts reduce effectively the pathology of the CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of natural murder cells in the sorrows is removed by the positive regulation of the recipient inhibiting natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of mols of the major complex of class I histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of oxygen reactive deficits (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of cow-shirts could at the same time remove the CoV replication and affect the "relecture" by exoribonate, which would create a selective pressure and cause highly pathogenic viral socks when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic covs could also develop by recombination, providing the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for the adaptation of the host.
So this is not a hazard if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as shoes and camels.
They reply strongly without providing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic portfolio are resident and caused by severe infection cases in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic choc; more immune response is strong, more pulmonary lesions are severe.
However, in the asymptomatic portfolio, the immune response was recovered from the CoV replication.
The same immune response strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is particularly strong in the shoes-souris.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in at least in the previous phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
Moreover, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is disappearing in the shoes.
Following this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general scheme by which the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were deployed.
While a beta-CoV-souris cheese shared by 95% of nucleotic homologies with the SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a 96% of nuclear homeology shared with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on the markets were discovered as similar virus porters in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Beta-CoVs of pangolin have been discovered similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin can be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoV of pangolin could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has been designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs were returned under the ramp fires due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in the cow-shirts and other animals has strongly shown our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many facts have shown that the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the coat and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since the infection in SARS-CoV is from the contact between humans and the markets, the closure of fresh products markets and the slaughter of civets that are located there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reason, the pangolins should be removed from the fresh products markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the covering of many beta-CoV beta lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question is to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolins and other mammifers and, where appropriate, how this transmission is going to happen will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists with the dromader for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, cow and milk for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the renewable MERS epidemies, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to elymone these viruses, new genotypes could exhaust and cause epidemies.
Many zoonotic CoVs are in nature.
In particular, the cow-souris CoVs, including the zoonotic potential, are very high.
The opportunities are not lacking that these zoonotic CoVs evolute and recombine, providing the emergency of new CoVs more transmissible and/or mortal in the future.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce inutile contacts between human and animals.
As a result of the ravage caused by SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, it should establish a better preparation and intervention plan.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a county opportunity is present.
Although surgeons have many favourable characteristics for virus diffusion, the probability for man to be in contact with the shoes and other wild species can be minimised if people are in need of keeping themselves at art.
Continue monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand CoV and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemies.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent the viral zoonoses is to keep away from the Ethiopian nines of the natural reserve of zoonoses.
All the secrets of SRAS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to pangols, it would be interested in observating in which circumstances chains and pangolins could share the same steroid nine.
Second, if the shoes play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people are in contact with the swimming hairs.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of the real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, shoes and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammifers, including domestic animals, are capable of contracting SARS-CoV-2, it is appropriate to be monitored as well as to experimental contamination.
Which is a cow-souris, a pangolin or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parents' virus observed in their natural hosts.
The future research in this area will enable the development traveller of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Require a update of COVID-19's "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" criteria
On 6 February 2020, our team had a rapid recommendation Directive for coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) and was describing our experience and provideing references to fighting this pandemy at the world level.
However, coronavir disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recently, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually based on the results of the current studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, the strategies of ↓c and treatment are also continued to be updated.
In this court, we answered a comment on our directives and provided the most recent criteria for a "supported case" and a "confirmed case" of the last directives on the COVID-19 (seventh version) of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a epidemic that now officially carries the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called a severe acue respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified Pandemie COVID-19.
To be able to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team set up a quick recommendation on the military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
She took much attention since she was published.
However, it should be noted that the COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress, based on the results of the current studies and the experience of the clinical practice; thus, the strategies of treatment and treatment are also continued to be updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Directives of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) identifyed seven issues from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, including some contexts substantially.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou and al. presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their works have made new evidence for our Directive and also constitute a precious reference to this global pandemy.
We approve their important work and thank them.
However, their work should also be updated in the last COVID-19 Directives and the treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh version test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspicious case must associate one of the characteristics of epidemiological anticipations with two clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three clinical evidence elements in the absence of epidemiological anticipations:
epidemiological anticipations: (1) a travel or residence anticipation in the city of Wuhan and in neighborhood areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days before the appearance of symptoms; (2) an anti-contact contact with infections of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids) (3) an anti-contact with patients with fibre or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan or neighboring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported during the last 14 days before the presentation of the symptoms; (4) an anti-contact contact with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fibre and abroads, etc.) in the week, in the same area.
Clinical evidence: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imagery presenting the characteristics of an infection in COVID-19; (3) total numbering of white cells indicating a normal, reduced or reduced numeration of lymfocytes from the beginning of the symptoms.
The confirmed case must be supported with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) PCR test in real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the enzyme of the viral geneome with a strong homogeneity with new coronavirusx with ; (3) serial serial test for the IgM and IgG of the SARS-CoV-2 anticorps; or change of the specific IgG anticorps of SARS-CoV-2 with negative or increasing the title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the IgM and IgG of the SARS-CoV-2.
We can find that the PCR test of nuclear acids in real time in respiratory ways or in blood pressures was used in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic description of blood precepts was acquired at the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and on the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serial evidence was acquired in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers aiming to find an optimal kit for the detection of nuclear acids for a quick-speed, as well as the samples of respiratory paths including the pre-processment of blood, with a growth of different species, and contributed to the positive result of the specific anticorps in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more evidence reminds us of the density of atypic symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou and al. graphic representation should be updated since they classified people with no clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The evaluation system should also be verified in the clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence is emerging and we ask the readers to submit their comments.
As regards the "subject cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest them to follow and comply with the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in the appropriate time to offer its aid.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a journal record
Yesterday, the Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 on one day.
The country thus records a mortality record due to virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bang Bang Bangese Institute of Epidemiology, Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) stated that the number of contaminated persons included 114 active cases and 33 health careers, who remained limited to home.
A total of 17 deaths was recorded.
Closing public transport started on 26 March and had to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medicin, fuel and food) was always authorised.
On March 19, these three people were already restored.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the million in the world, according to the data of Johns Hopkins University.
Everywhere in the world, the countries have announced more strict measures to prevent the propagation of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Master of Moscou, extended the town's limitation until 1 May.
The Parliament of Portugal voted on the prolongation of the 15-day national emergency state; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and a vote against.
Zonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe acue respiratory syndrome epidemies (SRAS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) inverted the trend to demonstrate how devastating and potentially mortal HCoV infection could be.
Most of the HCoV come from the shoes-souris with which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate hotels of some HCoV are also with.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in preventing huma diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals may also allow better understanding the CoV in humans.
According to the differences in the protein sequences, the CoVs are classified in four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, ↓-CoV and delta-CoV). The type of Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that shoes and rongers play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reserve of CoV and delta-CoV.
Today, seven human CoVs (HCoV) are with.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoV include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acue respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework to understand the natural history, motor forces and restrictive factors of the freshing of the species barry.
It may also guide or facilitate the research of the/hosts(s) reserving, intermediate and enhanced SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future counterparts.
Animal CoVs have been conserved since the end of the 1930s.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs were identified.
The first HCoV-229E suck was isolated in the respiratory paths of patients with a higher respiratory path in 1966, and then adjusted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected by HCOV-229E had the symptoms of the classic range, including head pain, inflammation, disease and fat pain, with fever and rates observed in 10 to 20% of the cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present everywhere in the world and are mainly transmitted in winter, in temperature climate countries.
Toilet paper limits by purchasing
Saturday and Saturday evening, Australian magazines chains Wool and Coles reduced their toilet paper purchase restrictions to two and a package by purchasing in all stores at the national scale respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits were shown in the form of messages to boxes and on the Facebook pages of chains.
Buyers apparently collected reserves by fear of the COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Wednesday, Wool ́ths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home supply to a package by command.
These measures have resulted in the restriction of four packages by purchasing introduced by Wool ́ths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press of 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four in force packages, "multi magazines are still in stock broken in the hour after delivery", and qualified the request for "unseen" while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, qualified "inattended".
The wines have known a "very growth" last week, according to a Wool's password.
The Costco magazine in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to decrease the penalty, Coles commanded greater packages with the suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Wool ́ths commanded an additional stock, while ALDI had already provided stocks for a proposed promotion on Wednesday.
Zimmerman, the ex-director of the Australian Association of Detailers, said that the detailers try to increase stocks, but that the restrictions of the local Council on the time of carrier delivery make the task difficult.
It provides an increase in production costs, while the suppliers are trying to answer the request, and less promotion.
On March, ALDI announced that after the pre-locked discovery of stocks, some stores are not able to honor the promotion of Thursday.
In a article on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert in the distribution sector of the Queensland University, explained that the stores reapprove stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a volumen article, which causes stocks of a reduced quantity that, once exhausted, leaves large spaces in rayons, enhancing the impression of a penny.
“ Coles and Wool’ths consider [that] if the rayons are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and defectives can be [buyed] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce the panic, ” explained Zimmerman in ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap stated last Wednesday that they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper manufacturing the paper Sorbent, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the article of News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first carrier in the businesses in Melbourne, while less than sales to the businesses were organized because the buyers were in conjunction during the long weekend of the holiday of the holiday.
The NT News Tuesday edition, a printed day in Darwin, included an eight-page range of pages intended to be cut off and used as a toilet paper.
The magazines were able to impose restrictions, a report on 3 March of ABC′a, where they announced that they were not intended to introduce purchase restrictions.
Zimmerman said that other products also knew a strong request, including masks, deinfectants, dry products, hygiene products for hands and fat.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday evening that Ocado's supermarket on the British line limited the toilet paper purchases of Andres to two 12 rolls packages.
The World Health Organization qualifies the COVID-19 of Pandemy
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) of pandemy.
Although the word "pandemy" is only referring to the rate of illness propagation, not to the dangerousness of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemy.
If the countries depict, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their population in the context of the response," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO General Director.
"We are very concerned, not only by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the former director of the United States Centres for Control and Prevention of diseases, the pandemy is "inconsistent".
He stated, in the issues made by CNN in February, that “only the grip, no other respiratory virus has been observed from its appearance to its continued propagation worldwide. ”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, explaining that "We have never been witnesses of a pandemia caused by a coronavirus".
What he said: "and we have never been witnesses of a pandemy that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemy status followed by the WHO's decision in January to declare epidemia a international health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infections in the United States, said to the epidemic: "To shorten the situation will be empired."
Thursday, Press announced that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, which led more than 4 600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavir pandemy is a current coronavir disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acid respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, stated international health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemy on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, which resulted in approximately 97 000 deaths.
Approximately 364 000 people are healthy.
The letality rate is estimated to 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13,04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Correct symptoms include fever, tough and drunkenness.
Complications may include pneumonia and water respiratory disorder syndrome.
The time between the exposure and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can coscile between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is a symptomatic and supporting therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing the hands, covering the mouth to cover, staying remote from others, monitoring and limiting the suspicioned persons to be infected.
World authorities have reacted by setting restrictions on movements, quarters, coverages, risk controls on workplaces and closed institutions.
The pandemy has caused serious socioeconomic disturbances at the world, report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalized penalties aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at the national or local scale in 193 countries, with approximately 99.4% of the world student population.
False information on the virus has been provided on the Internet, and xenophobia and discrimination incidents have occurred to Chinese, other Asian origin and appearance of East and South East, as well as to other people coming from many regions accounting for the virus.
As a result of decreasing travel and fermentation in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in the atmosphere pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown case of cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened on the beginning of January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the market of large seas fruit in Huanan, and therefore the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemia is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently and closely covered virus with the coronavirus of the cow-souris, the coronavirus of the pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Then, it was discovered that the first known person who had presented symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person was not manifestly linked to the later home of the fresh products market.
In the cases of the first home reported in December 2019, both thirds had been linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a non-verified report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could rise on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases seemed to reduce in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong sub-estimation of the cases, especially among those who have good symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among youths, 19 years old and less than 2,4% of the cases worldwide. The United Kingdom Science Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before being able to achieve an effective collective immunity.
The cases indicate the number of persons tested at the COVID-19, whose test was confirmed positively by the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies to not test those who had only good symptoms such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A 16 March study showed that in China, until 23 January, 86% of the infections by COVID-19 were estimated not detected, and that these unsaved infections were the source of 79% of documentated cases.
A statistical analysis on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases reported.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study conducted by the United States Control and Prevention Centres concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people reached by COVID-19 are healing.
For those who do not cure, the time between the appearance of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, as the most core of 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were imposed on COVID-19.
In China, at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of the deaths covered over 60 years, and 75 per cent would suffer from pre-exhibitional health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death accounts related to the COVID-19 pandemy generally refer to those who have been tested positive to the COVID.
The number of real victims of the COVID-19 could be much higher, since it could not include non-tested persons - for example home, in travel houses, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the overmortality numbers during the pandemy are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the COVID dead.
A portfolio of the United States Centres for Control and Prevention of illnesses (CDC) has recognized “We know that [the number of announced deaths] is subestimated”, a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports on the sub-evaluation reports in the United States. Such sub-estimation is often occurred during pandemys, such as the H1N1 grippe epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on the first February to the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was held in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than twelve deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents other than the Antarctic continents. Several indicators are permanently used to quantify mortality.
These numbers are different from the regions and with time, and are affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time expired from the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases in a given period.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the world case-dès report is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-dées report have decreased by 17.3% (for symptoms appeared between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the rate of letality (letality rates), which represent the percentage of persons that are compared to a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represent the percentage of contaminated (diagnosised and non-diagnosed) that are compared to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Many scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford considers that the rate of infection for pandemy in its globality is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this furniture is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on letality ratings.
WHO supports that pandemy can be controlled.
The pic and the definitive duration of the epidemic are uncertain and can vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania stated: "No control, infectional epidemies usually are stabilised and then starts to recover when the disease is missing hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen. ”
Zhong Nanshan, Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, claimed that "this could be completed from June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures aimed at enhancing the propagation of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue, eventually for a year or two”.
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, a distance and other measures will be necessary “ until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more).
William Schaffner at the University of Vanderbilt said: "I think it is impossible that this coronavirus – because it is very easily translated – is totally exposed to it and that it could "be transformed into seasonal disease, possibly reapparent every year".
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the width of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes not specific enough and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry tooth (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of odorate, slaughter, muscular and articulary pains, gorge pain, heads, freshness, vomiting, hemopthia, diarrhea, or cyanase. WHO states that about one of six persons is seriously sick and has respiratory difficulties.
The United States’ control and prevention of diseases (CDC) recognises the symptoms of emergency such as respiratory difficulty, pain or persistent toracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult waves, and face or blue lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The later development of the disease can cause serious pneumonia, a severe acute respiratory syndrome, a septicemia, a sectical choc and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with results in the test confirming the infection, then researchers have made recommendations that people who have been contacted with confirmed infections should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic assessments variate from some to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between pollution and the appearance of symptoms) is obscure between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people in the COVID-19 who lost odorate was initially 30% before 15%.
Certain information on how the disease is spread remains to be determined.
The illness should be transmitted mainly in the case of a refreshed contact and by rubber fines produced by tossing, starving or speaking; this refreshed contact corresponds to a range of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that stuck without protecting can design guittellets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) at 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be translated by guittelets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be designed by speaking, and that respiratory goutellites could also be designed during the expiration, especially by speaking, though the virus is usually not airported.
Postileons can be attached to the mouth or nose of other persons who are heated near or even inhaled in the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary inflammation and reanimation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are pulverized and thus result in air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, especially the skin, before touching his eyes, his nose, or his mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted by the salts, this risk is considered weak.
The Chinese Government excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, however, propagation may be possible before the symptoms appear and at progressive stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for disease up to three days before symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few signatures of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of diseases (ECDC) states that if you do not know exactly with what facility the disease is spread, a person generally contains two to three others. The virus survives even hours or days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus could be detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel 304, after one day on the carton, and after four hours on the cow.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Home animals and other animals have been tested positive to the COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend to wash their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people could have touched.
Severe acid respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia associated with Wuhan water respiratory disease home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronavirus appearing in the nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the householder, which solve its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis showed that coronavirus is geneticly belonging to the type Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus sub-genetic (line B), associated with two sockets of shoes.
It is equal to 96% of the geneome of another coronavirus coronavir (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the geno-sequences between pangolin viruses and humans.
The comparison of the genealogy in this day has shown a maximum of 92% of the common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be temporarily injected on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is effected by inverse transcription of polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanner secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and scanning in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is just more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, because many of its image functions coincident with other pathological pneumonias and processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “the scanner is not used to depict or as a test of first intention for the COVID-19”.
WHO has made several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first issue on 17 January.
The test uses the inverse transcription of the reaction by polymerase in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test may be carried out on respiratory or blood-precepts.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
This test is generally carried out on a practice of rhinopharynx, but it can also be used for a gorge-prompt. Many workshops and companies currently develop serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them was reliable enough to be approved for a generalized use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by laboratory only certified.
The characteristic image elements on radiografies and tomodensitometery (scanner) of people with symptoms include opacities in asymmetric periferic depolysis and an absent of pleural expansion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently a international online database of confirmed case image results.
As a result of recovery with other infections such as adenovirus, without confirmation by PCR is a limited precision to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of the toracic scanners with the PCR and showed that if the image is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, predicting it as a depisting tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutive neurones networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics both on radiographics and scanners.
Strategy for the prevention of the transmission of disease includes globally a good personal hygiene, washing the hands, avoiding touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth with unslaved hands, and cutting or extinguishing the mouth directly into a powder.
It was recommended to those who had already been contaminated to carry a chirurgical mask in public.
Distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have prohibited or discontinued all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the Community transmission stage in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spread in the communities, and some members of these communities don't know where or how they have been contaminated. It is advised to health professionals who are concerned about someone who may be infected to take habitual precautions and contact precautions, and to carry out protective clusters.
The use of phone location data by the governments in this regard has highlighted confidentiality problems with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for limitation to this type of monitoring.
Various mobile applications were offered or proposed on the basis of the voluntary, and since 7 April 2020, more than twelve expert groups worked on respecting private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user close to other phones.
The users then receive a message if they have been contacted with someone who has been tested positive at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently about how to prevent infection; for example, renewing the nose and locking with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash the hands to prevent the propagation of disease.
The CDC recommends people to wash their hands often in the sand and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been at the toilet or when the hands are soiled; before eating; and after being mossed, cut off, or exploded.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the householder, who breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended to use a deinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing a volume of at least 60 % of alcohol when the sand and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, the nose, or the mouth with unlaved hands.
The surfaces may be discontamined in several ways (in a minute of exposure to the desinfectant for an inoxidable steel surface), including 62-71 % etha, 50-100 % isopropanol, sodium hypochloride, 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 %, and iodated povidone at 0.2-7.5 %.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate of chlorhexidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspicioned or confirmed in a establishment as an office or a crochet, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms and common electronic equipment such as tablets, tactiles, keyboards, telecommands and automatic distributors used by sick people be disinfekted.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and their nose with their powder or a mouth when they are all or exhausted, and to cast every mouth immediately.
The chirurgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the puzzles designed by speaking, extinguishing, and extinguishing.
WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at the University of Leeds, “Baring a mask can reduce the prospect of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the abstention of good hygiene of hands.” The use of masks has also been advised to those who care for a person who is potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended the mask port for good health people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care about a disease reached by COVID-19, even if she recognized that the mask port can help people not touch their face.
Many countries began to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medicic masks in the wheat. China has specifically recommended the use of medical masses for good health people, especially in case of closeness (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends carrying a chirurgical mask in public transport or bonded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make face masks in themselves and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public outcomes without mask or other ways to cover their nose and his mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the gate of the mask to everyone in the public places, so that everyone protects himself and protects others.
The Austrian Government ordered everyone who enters a supermarket to carry a mask.
Israel asked all his residents to carry a mask in public.
Thaiwan, who produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the mask mask on 1 April.
The Panama has made the port of a mask for any output, while recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also largely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (a.k.a. distancy) includes infection control measures aimed at sustaining the development of the disease by reducing contacts between people.
The methods include quarters, travel restrictions and closure of schools, jobs, stages, theatres and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied by yourself, by limiting its travels, by avoiding the people, without contact and by keeping a distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in the regions affected by epidemia.
The maximum width of races recommended by the Governing and Health Agencies of the United States was quickly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the public races of more than two persons; the older adults and those with subjacent health problems such as diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weak immune system know the increased risk of serious disease and complications; thus they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the term “social distance” by “distance”.
The use of the term "social distance" was to believe that it was necessary for a total social isolation, rather than to encourage people to keep contact with others through other means. Some authorities had direct lines on sexual health to follow during the pandemy.
They understand the recommendation to have sexual relations only with a person with whom we live, who does not have the virus or who has the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for positive persons at COVID-19 and those who think to be infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions for a correct isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended that it be for individual populations living in the affected areas.
The most strict individual instructions were given to persons in most risk groups.
Those who have been exposed to a disease reached by COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to be placed for 14 days since they could be exposed for the last time.
Epidemic control strategy is degradation or elimination, and attainment.
The adjustment is placed in the first phases of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the propagation of disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the propagation of disease, efforts turn to the attainment phase: measures are taken to slow down this propagation and to reduce its effects on the health care system and society.
Increasing and attainment measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination of more extreme measures is needed to influence the pandemy by decreasing the number of basic reproduction less than 1. A part of the management of a infectious disease epidemic is to try to attain the epidemic pic: this is what is called to extend the epidemic corbe.
This allows to reduce the risk of overload of health services and to gain time for vaccines and treatment development.
Among non-pharmaceutical interventions that can handle epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask port and individual distantity; social distance measures such as closing schools and religious offices; a public effort to promote the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; and environmental activities such as cleaning of surfaces; more drastic measures aimed at jugulating the epidemia have been taken in China when the gravity of this has become manifest, such as the establishment of entire cities and a strict prohibition of travelling.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures to limit the propagation of virus.
South Korea introduced mass depistage and posts in quarant' localized, and made warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support for infected people who have been put into quaranta, and has affected harmful threats to those who have not done it.
Thaiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctified the accommodation of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that attenuation (silence but not elimination of epidemical propagation) and elimination (reverse epidemic development) faces important challenges.
Optimal attainment policies can reduce the request for health care by 2/3 and half death, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of dead, and health care systems are subjected.
The elimination may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus in the population hum' (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because, in the contrary, the transmission is quickly rebound when the measures are released.
The long-term intervention to eliminate pandemy has a social and economic cost.
There are no antiviral treatments approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are current, including existing treatment tests.
The use of medicines without order against rubber or consumption of drinks and relaxation can contribute to delaying the symptoms.
Based on gravity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroides can increase the results.
Several components already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently in the study for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal medicines" can add the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The capacity and health care adjustment for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by the WHO as a measure of response to epidemic.
The ECDC and the Regional Office of the WHO for Europe have direct lines for the attention of hospitals and primary health care services for the rebuilding of resources at different levels, in particular by dedicating laboratory services to the COVID-19 tests, canceling non-necessary interventions, when possible, separating and isolating patients tested at COVID-19, and strengthening the capacity of intensive care through the training and discipline of the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the place of origin of all cases (called zero patients).
The first case known by the new coronavirus could go up to 1 December 2019, in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
They are generally linked to the market of large sea fruit of Huan, who also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A unknown cause pneumonia house was observed on December 26, and the doctor Zhang Jixian was treated at the Hospital of the province of Hubei, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central hospital of Wuhan warned their lusts of a "coronavirus similar to SRAS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reproached by the police for propagating false voices, and another, Ai Fen, was reproached by his superiors for giving the warning.
The municipal health committee of Wuhan then held a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation beginning of January. In the first phases of the epidemic, the number of cases were doubled about seven days and half.
At beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the New Year's New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool and a major railway compatibility place.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases on one day, including two people in Pekin and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6 174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of cases confirmed in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported in the world; more than 97 000 people were dead and more than 364 000 were healed.
Approximately 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Because of the pandemy in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have limited movements and controls to borders.
The national reactions included deficiency measures such as the depths (a.k.a. commands to stay at home, open or confined) and cover them. On April 2, approximately 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a limitation for the United States, more than 50 million people are limited to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people in the world knew a form of restriction, and a number was increased by 2.6 billion days later — approximately one third of the world population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; a not confirmed report suggests that the first case would be on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown cause pneumonia case on 26 December, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patients samples on December 27, 2019 indicate the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued by the municipal health committee of Wuhan on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "proliferating sounds" about epidemia.

Central banks respond faster than they did in 2008's financial exhaustance.
Tourism is one of the most touched sectors because of movement prohibitions, closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against every travel worldwide.
Thus, many aircraft companies have cancelled flights because of a decreased demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Regional Airlines Flybe has failed.
The impact on the cross-sector has ever reached a level before.
Several holidays and iron ports have also been closed.
The epidemia coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the New Year of China.
A number of events included important crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual festivals of the New Year, and private enterprises have also closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Monday Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass racing, including the prohibited City of Pekin and the traditional temple festivals.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the holidays of the New Year to 10 February, imposing the majority of the jobs to not open before that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's BDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has passed to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has stated a emergency situation, shut schools up to March and cancels its festivals of the New Year. The distribution sector has been affected at the world level, with reductions of times for the opening of stores or temporary closures.
The visits of trademakers in Europe and Latin America have fallen from 40%.
In Northern America and Middle East, trademakers found a decrease of 50 to 60%.
This also caused a fall of 33 to 43% of the petroleum in the commercial centres in March compared to fev.
World Trade Centre Operators have introduced additional measures, such as cleaning frequency, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and cancel events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the Pandemie could leave between 14 and 22 million additional persons in the Latin American extreme poverty.
In January and February 2020, some 5 million people in China lost their employment during the picking of the epidemic in Wuhan.
In China, a large number of about 300 million rural migration workers were blocked with them in internal or coincidence provinces in Hubei provinces. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their employment and requested assistance to the Government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million employment in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, and the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The limitation in India left decades of million migrant workers in India (receiving a daily salary) to unemployment. The investigation of the Institutus Reid observed that 44 per cent of Canadians had a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900 000 workers lost their employment in Spain since the mid-marh 2020 limit.
· The second half of March, 4 million French workers made a request for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers made a request for universal credit. Nearly half a half million German companies changed their salaries to a partial activity device that the Government called Kurz Work.
France and Great Britain have adopted the German work compensation device at partial time.
The sectors of spectacle and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemy, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both payable and independent, at the world level.
Arts and Cultural organizations have tried to maintain their mission (financed by the State) to provide access to the cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the security of their employees and public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, throughout the world and at different degrees, museums, libraries, spectacle rooms and other cultural institutions have been closed until the new order and their exhibitions, events and representations were cancelled or reported.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of disease, cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, conferences and modes.
The cinema industry also discovered an interruption. The Vatican announced that the collections of the Saint Seme in Rome, which had been held last week of the Christian penitentiary period of Carema, were canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended the elderly Christians to stay with them rather than assist on Sunday morning; some churches distribute their religious services to radio, online and direct or television while others propose to practice their worship in “drive-in”.
As the Roman Catholic Diocese, who closed his churches and his capsules and the place of Saint-Pierre, who was empty of all his Christian perseverants, other religious institutions also canceled their services and restricted public races in churches, mosques, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Health Minister announced the cancellation of prayers on Friday in the areas affected by the epidemic, and the holy places were then closed, while Saudi Arabic prohibited the entrance of foreign pearls and its residents at the holy sites of La Mecque and Medina.
Pandemy has caused the most important interruption of the world's sports calendary since World War II.
The most important sports events have been cancelled, including the EUFA 2019-20 Campionship Ligue, the British Football Championat 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 and the LNH season 2019-20.
The epidemia has disturbed the organisation of Olympical Games in the sea of 2020, which starts at the end of July; the Olympical Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replaned by 2020, but latest to 2021." The casinos and other world-wide games have closed and live poker tours have been reported or cancelled.
This has moved many players to log in online, and many online games sites have found a significant increase in their number of new records. The spectacle world has also been touched, with several music groups who have suspended or cancelled their concert turns.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have searched for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement of traditional direct representations, such as online and direct concerts or online "festivals" created in order to produce, spread and promote their work.
In line, many Internet teams on the theme of the coronavir have spread because many privileges of humor and action in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, a renouncement of prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been found to people of Chinese and east Asian origin and to people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidences related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and in Asia-Pacific region.
Reports on February (when most of the cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups throughout the world, which the Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also found an increase in anti-Chinese feeling.
Many people of Wuhan and Hubei have reported a discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the residents of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progress of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, residents of the first European country to take up a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. The citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have first signed petitions to prohibit Chinese to enter into their country to stop disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became angry on Twitter.
China and other Asiatics living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist insults and aggressions.
The American President Donald Trump made the criticism for qualifying the coronavirus of "Chine virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, manifestants attacked bus transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students originating from North East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have reached harcèlement in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The President of the Bengal-O-Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed the nature and "it is why God took his opposite on them".
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consulat in Kolkata, which qualifys them of "fauses". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people were added by the pandemy, as foreigners were described as "foreign waste" that should "eject".
Many paying newspapers have recovered them for all or part of their covering on the coronavirus.
Many scientists have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory detection of the respiratory disease at coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of detection of virus and detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of anticorps (serology) can be used at the same time for the population's monitoring and monitoring.
Anticorps tests show how many people have contracted disease, including those whose symptoms were too difficult to be declared or asymptomatics.
A precise mortality rate of disease and the collective immunity level among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Because of a limited depth, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and there were important differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
It is highlighted that this variable affects significantly the reported letality rates, which may be considered overestimated in some countries.
By using the inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharynge ecuvilon or the expectation sample.
The results are usually available in a few hours at 2 days.
The RT-PCR test is carried out from pharyngian ecuvalons is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear from the greenhouse while it continues its multiplication in the lungs.
In persons tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in deep respiratory paths by aspiration catheter, or a crachat (expectation) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by the Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using an inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the base of 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test at 23 January 2020.The South Korean company K日biotech developed a clinical detection kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the use of emergency from the National Administration of Medical Products for a SARRS-CoV-2-based PCR.In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their RT-PCR resources in real time of the new coronavir 2019 (2019-nCV) to health workers through the International Reactor Resource.
Among the ancient versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three received unconcluding results due to defective reactions, as well as a cycle of tests to the CCDs of Atlanta. In fact, a average of less than 100 samples per day has been treated successfully throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and at this time the federal and local laboratory received the initialisation of the depth.
The test was approved by Food and Drugs by authorization of emergency use.The United States commercial workshops started the description at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitation has been reported. The collection and treatment of samples should be made to the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biography VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA for a test that could be performed in large quantities at 3.5 hours, so that a device was performed at approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an authorisation for emergency use (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the Abbott 2000 system. The FDA had already granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EU FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the isotherm amplification of nuclear acids instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method may provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott intends to intensify the production to provide 50,000 tests daily.A test using a monoclonal antibodies which is specifically lying to the protein of the nucleocapside (protein N) of the new coronavirus is in progress in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid test of the influenza.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “pulmonary radiographics have a low value in the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometer] can be concluded before even the appearance of symptoms. ”
Of the typical symptoms on the TDM, there are multi-loberal bilateral depolysis opacities with periferic, asymmetric and post-distribution.
A subpleal predomination, a crazy paving and a consolidation develops as the disease is developed.
A study comparing the PCR with the TDM in Wuhan, on the basis of the current pandemy, suggested that TDM is just more sensitive than the PCR, though less precisely, several of its image-effects coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends that “the TDM is not used for depisting or as a first-line test to deal with COVID-19”.In March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for initial description.
The production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in persons from about 7 days after the symptoms appear, to determine immunity and in the monitoring of the population.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLS) or by test on the patient's head (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
High-delayed systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their ability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TRC, only one device blood sample is usually used, although series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For the PoCT, one single blood sample is usually taken by skin pointing.
On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities who were duely informed the Agency and who could now distribute their antibodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA in accordance with the authorisation of emergency use.In March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in blood samples.
The depisting capacity is of several hundred samples in a few hours, which is just faster than the PCR test of the viral RNA.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the infection beginning.The United Kingdom found that no of the antibodies test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently perfect to be used.
Hong Kong set a plan in the context of which suspicious cases may remain with them, "the emergency service will provide the patient a sample tube", the patients cracken in, return and receive the result of the test.The British NHS announced that it brings a pilot project to test the cases of suspects at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient does not infect others by making a hospital or the need to disinfekte an ambulance in the case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 Drive Test for suspicious cases, a health professional provides a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to perform one of the fastest and exhaustive depistages in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Criminal Insurance Insurance Insurance Insurance stated on 2 March that she had the ability to perform about 12 000 tests per day, and that 10 700 patients were tested during the week-end.
The costs are taken by the disease insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, driver tests were available in several large towns.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were stated.
A first laboratory study found that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483 295 samples was tested up to week 12/2020 and that 33 491 samples (6.9 %) have been made a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers of Technion and the Rambam hospital have developed and tested a method of analyzing the samples of 64 patients at the same time, re-grouping the samples and processing the samples only if the combined sample appears positive.In Wuhan, an improved laboratory of emergency detection of 2 000 square metres called Huo-Yan (in Chinese, ↓, "Feail" in France) could be opened by 5 February 2020.
Thanks to its construction in five days by Wang Jian, the BGI funder, the modelisation showed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the cost corresponding to the depth would have doubled without this depthing capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by laboratory Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was up to 50,000 tests per day.Origami Assays developed free models were performed to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for the COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be exempted in small laboratories without liquid robots.
In March, penalties and insufficient amounts of reactions became an engine for mass deployment in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation encouraged some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that aim to heat samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genes to continue the depistage. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates were announced that now the largest country of its population per resident for Coronavirus, and were going to intensify the depisting to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained by combination of the ability to conduct driver tests and purchasing a high-depth laboratory at the level of the population at Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories in China).
Constructed in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Different testing formulas for various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low income countries without the resources necessary to develop their own kits.
The German formula was held on 17 January 2020. The Protocol developed by the United States Sickness Control Centres was only held on 28 January, retarship of the tests in the United States.The China and the United States had problems at the level of the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, could not provide enough kits to answer the request and recommendations for health experts.
In contrast, experts indicate that the majority of the tests in South Korea has contributed to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The depisting capacity, in large part in the labs of the private sector, has been strengthened by the South Korean Government for several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of depisting programmes as the best way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemy.The strong request for tests due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States private workshops, and the reserves of chemicals and chemical reactions were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems relating to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had “deficiencies”. The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private tests.Spania bought test kits with the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the incapacity of collecting samples or correctly using kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that he would recover the kits with wrong results and replace them by another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic provided false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into Danube. Ateş Kara from the Turkish Health Ministry stated that the test kits that Turkey bought to China had “height error rates” and that it did not use them. The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced that they were unusable in April 2020.
The description, followed by the 40% of those who received a positive result and the trace of persons who were in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 portfolio, has given positive results.
The researchers in the Italian city of Vo, the place of the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests to the total population of approximately 3.400 people, approximately ten days of interval.
Approximately half of the people who received a positive result had no symptoms, and all the cases covered were put into quarant.
With the limitation of movements in the commune, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracking of contacts, to the incoming travel restrictions, to the depisting and to the quarantine, the coronavir pandemy of 2020 in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and sales facilities.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise the residents to stay with them on 28 March, but the schools rounded at the date set out at the end of the vacation on 23 March.
Many other countries also managed the pandemy by agressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming, depisting and putting on quarter, but with less aggressive restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study discovered that countries who have performed most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower letality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people than symptoms or any symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analysis capacities and national laboratorys who have only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their five first positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference workers to perform confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Africa.
In the following table, the ‘Positive in % of tests’ column depends on national depth policy.
A country that tests that the persons authorised to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country testing the enemy of citizens than they have or not symptoms, other factors are the same.
The lavage of hands, also called hygiene of the hands, corresponds to the purification of hands in order to recover the fats, fats, micro-effects or other adverse substances.
The systematic washing of hands with sane to some "key moments" of the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, such as diarrhee and cholera, which are transmitted through air-f’ale.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grippe or rubber, for example, by laying hands before touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth (c.-d. muscles).
It is important to wash the hands at five key moments of the day: before and after deficiency, after cleaning the feet of a child or changing his beds, before eating a child, before and before and after preparing food or manipulation of meat, fish or crushed bird.
If you don't have water or sand under your hand, you can wash your hands to the censure. The World Health Organization recommends to wash your hands:
before, while and after the preparation of food;
before and after being occupied with a sick person;
after changing the beds of a child or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after moving or cutting/external;
after touching a animal, food for animals or residues of animal origin;
Hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The fate of washing the hands before administrating medicines or providing medical care may prevent or reduce the propagation of diseases.
The main medical goal of the hand washing is elym· patogenic agents (bacteria, virus or other microemes that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the large public.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction of the propagation of influenza, coronavir and other infectious diseases; the prevention of diarrhea infections; the reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infantile mortality rate in households.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to improving the growth of children under five years.
In developing countries, infantile mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behaviour changes, such as the lavage of hands to satan.
This simple practice can reduce the rate of mortality associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
The establishment of actions to promote the lavage of hands could reduce about one third diarrhee episodes, a comparable number with the obtained by providing potable water for low income regions.
It is the most effective and less costful way to prevent diarrhea and water respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be made automatically in the homes, schools and communities of the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years, which makes approximately 1.8 million victims per year.
As a result, diarrhee and pneumonia result in the death of approximately 3.5 million children each year.
According to the CEF, the fact that taking the habit of washing the hands with sun before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing nearly half deaths from diarrhee and a quarter of the death imputable to water respiratory infections.
The lavage of hands is usually associated with other health measures under water, asylum and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The lavage of hands also protects the empetigo, which is transmitted directly by contact.
Minor delegate effect, frequency lavage of hands can cover the skin by providing a skin dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that hand washing could lead to echema or dermatite at the level of hands, characterised by squamous skin and demangeases, especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsory sexual disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash the hands at five key moments of the day to reduce the air-feal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (mixing, defection), after cleaning the feet of a child (or changing his beds), before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing food or manipulating of meat, fish or crushed flight.
It is also necessary to wash the hands correctly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after taking into account a shock or a wound, after being cut off, thrown or mosqued, after touching animal waste or manipulated and after touching orders.
In many countries, the cleaning rate of hands to satan is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries and with the hygiene of hands, 38.7 per cent of the average households were hands with sauna. In 2014, a study showed that it was the highest rate in Saudi Arabia (97 per cent), the United States were in the middle of table (77 per cent) and China showed the lowest rate (23 per cent). There are now several methods to develop behavior and democracy the use of the sun for the sake of hands at the main time of the day. In particular, it is intended to propose students in developing countries to wash their hands in group at precise times of the day so that children may make this practice a habit.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "primary health care programme" in order to promote children's health and education.
The deparsition twice a year, associated with daily lavage of hands to saune and daily brossing of teeth with a fluored dentifrice, is in the heart of this national programme.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microemes presented on the skin, we need to guard sains or water detergents.
The main action of science and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to solution and to increase solutionability.
Only water is not an effective cleaning for skin because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are hardly solved in water.
A suitable water delay, however, easily cleaning.
For its reusable nature, solid shame can be dealing with the issues of useful uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of ↑terries from solid contaminated soap concluded that the transfer was low because the halts are rejected with the mouse.
The Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) indicates the same as that “the automatic swimming distributors are preferable”.
Anti-bacterian sciences were strongly recommended to those concerned about their health status.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended deinfectants allows the use of anti-biotics in nature to target residents.
However, anti-bacterian sains contain core antibacterian agents such as triclosan, with many sucks of resistance.
Thus, even if the sugars resisting antibiotics are not the fruit of the anti-bacterian sains, these could not be as effective as announced.
Besides the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, milk acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobian function, and other protective agents (alia, vitamins, menhol, plant extracts).A strict analysis of the Oregon University Health School indicated that the sains were as effective as the antibacterian sains intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hands.
The warm water used to wash the hands is not enough heavy to kill the tears.
The body temperature (37 °C) increases rapidly.
However, heat and soap water is more efficient than cold and soft water to eliminate natural oils of salt and soft oil.
But contrary to the popular faith, scientific studies showed that the use of tissue water did not contribute to reduce the microbian burden on hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a product of hygiene of non-water hands.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, hygiene products from non-water hands based on alcohol (currently called hydroalcool solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hands deinfectants) began to be popular.
Most of them are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethane associated with a heating agent such as the carbon (acrilic acid polymer) for ≥ a ice, or a humectant such as glycerin, to make a liquid or mouse for a greater use facility and to reduce the ashing effect of alcohol.
The diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobian activity.The defectives for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol eliminate genes effectively.
Hydroalcool solutions kill the roughs, multiresistant steroids (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (as HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and champions.
Hydroalcool solutions containing 70 % of alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction by 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of 30 seconds after the application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of the deficiencies presented on the hands 1 minute after the application.
Hydroalcool solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroentherite.A sufficient quantity of desinfecting for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used for good me or cover the two hands.
The dust and the back of the two hands and the interstics between the fingers and the angles should be limited for about 30 seconds until the liquid, mouse or ice is dry.
The American Centre for Control and Prevention of diseases recommends the washing of hands rather than the use of hydroalcool solutions, especially when the hands are safe.
The accurate use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination of micro-emises; however, they do not have to replace a suitable lavage of hands unless you have water and water.
Frequent use of hydroalcool solutions may cause skin drying if the formula is not strengthened by emolynts and/or hydratants of the skin.
The efficacy of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by embracing glycerin and/or other emolynts in the formula.
In the clinical trials, hydroalcool solutions containing emolynts have just caused less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobian sains or detergents.
Alergic contact dermatite, contact urticator or hyperequity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcool solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcool solutions are less trends to cause irritant contact dermatites has made them more attractive than water and water washing.
Despite their efficiency, non-water products do not eliminate the organic materials presented on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why the defectives for hands are not as effective as the snow and water to avoid the propagation of many patogenic agents, since these are remaining on their hands.
The efficiency of deinfectants for no alcohol hands depends strongly on ingredients and formula, and has always been just lower than the alcohol and alcohol-based deinfectants.
Recently, the formulas using benzalconium chloride have shown a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobian activity after application, in the difference of alcohol, which are achieved after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy sauna, and they use rather the census or the earth.
The census or the earth can be more effective than the only water but less than it knows.
Moreover, if the earth or the census are contaminated by microemes, it can increase the propagation of diseases rather than breathing it.
In the way of the sand, the census is also a defective agent because, in contact with water, it forms a alcaline solution.
WHO recommends the censure or sand as alternative to the sawn when it is not available.
The American Centre for Control and Prevention of disease recommends to wash the hands correctly to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
I have hands with courant water tissue or cold.
The current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while the water temperature does not make differences.
Make a generous quantity of sunk on the hands by striking them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the angles.
The science removes the skin worms, and studies reveal that people have the tendency to wash their hands more carefully when they use satan than with only water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action to fracture grown fraction, which helps to eliminate the skin worms, and to flourish longer getting more wheat.
A lot of riding to coherent water.
Renacing in a stagnating water bassin can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean or free air.
The most commonly forgotten areas are powder, point, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the angles.
The artificial onions and the vernis with angles can have microemes.
A hydrated lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to wash the hands when the robet and/or the sand water is not available. For example, make the water of a bidon or a persuaded and/or use of the censure if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to economy water, such as the tippy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple cup that uses a suspended cross using a corn, and a pedal that allows to spend a small quantity of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective drying of hands is a essential part of the hygiene process of hands, but the best way to dry hands in the toilet is discussed.
Moreover, research suggests that paper-services are much more hygiene than electrical sugars than we are often found in the toilet.
In 2008, a study financed by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the Westminster University (Londres), to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper-services, warm air-droughts and more modern air jets.
Following the lavage and drying of hands at warm air-drought, it was shown that the total number of halts increased by average by 194% on the fingerprint and 254% on the powder.
Success in air-eye was a average increase in the total number of feeds on the fingers of 42% and 15% powders.
Following the washing and drying of hands with a paper-service, the total number of rubbers was reduced by 76% in average on the fingerprint and up to 77% on the powder.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a cross-contamination potential with the other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-bearing season, which surfaces the air outside of the device at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to exhaust the microems from the hands and from the device and may contaminate other toilet users, as well as the toilet environment in a range of up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air suit-mainly allows to spread microems at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres of the dawn.
In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product and Environment, various hand drought methods were evaluated.
Following the drying of hands, the following variables were observed:
There are many different sugar-main manufacturers, and the sugar-main has been compared to drying with paper-services.
The washing of hands with disinfectant tabs is a alternative solution during movements, in the abstention of sand and water.
Hydroalcool solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of hands in medical environment has become obligatory well after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis has discovered its efficiency (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that give reminders when the hospital staff forgets to wash his hands.
One study showed that their use would lead to decreasing infection rates.
The pharmaceutical lavage of the hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generic quantity of sain and water or ice to mouse and break each part of the hands.
The hands must be breaked against each other by embracing between the fingers.
In the case of residues under the corners, it is possible to use a powder browse to remove them.
Since the serums presented in the water are possible to stay on the hands, it is important to renew and try with a own sergeant.
After drying, the cartridge must be used to close the robinet (and open the output door if appropriate).
This enables us to avoid repeating hands in the contact of surfaces.
The goal of washing hands in health structures is to recover pathogenic micro-emissions and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand cleaning rate remains inacceptable in most medical institutions, a number of doctors and sisters who forget regularly to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microemes.
According to a study, the correct washing of hands and following other simple procedures can reduce 66% of the rate of blood infections related to catheders. The World Health Organization has provided a brochure that describes the standard procedure to wash and break hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hygiene of hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect the comments of the internates.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Available trade devices may measure and certifie the hygiene of the hands if the compliance with the regulation is shown.
The World Health Organization defines " Five indications" relating to hygiene of hands:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before a aseptic gesture; and
after having contact with the patient, the fact that the antiseptic chemicals in the saune (sounds "medicals" or "antimicrobians") results in the lavage agent of hands in the destruction of the germes.
It is desirable to elimine these gears before performing a chirurgical operation or in environments where the residents of antibiotics are very expanded. To "frotter" the hands for a chirurgical operation, it is necessary to have a robot that can open and close without touching it with hands, a product of chlorhexidine or iode washing, sterile servings to dry their hands after they were washed, a sterile bross to float and another sterile tool to clean under the corners.
All boys must be removed.
In the framework of this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and pre-braces to the cow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to break hands for 10 minutes.
During the rince, we need to avoid that the water on the pre-braces falls down to the hands.
Once the hands were washed, hands should be dropped with a sterile ling and shoot a chirurgical box.
In order to reduce the spread of germes, it is preferred to wash your hands or to use an antiseptics for hands before and after being occupied with a sick person.
As regards the control of staphylococ infections in hospitals, the main benefits of hand was obtained in the first 20% of the lavage, and there were only few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand waste over 35%.
If we compare the lavage of hands made with an antibacterian satan, the rate of infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing the cleaning of hands with a based alcohol solution and the washing of hands with an antibacterian satan for a average of 30 seconds each, the first decreases the contamination of 26% compared to the second.
But satan and water are more efficient than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza A (H1N1) virus and the Clostridium-spores in hands. To improve the hygiene of hands in health care institutions, it is possible, in particular, to form the staff in the lavage of hands, to put more alcohol products on the basis of it and to address him written and verbal reminders about it.
More research is needed to discover the most effective interventions in various health structures.
In developing countries it is considered that lavating hands to savane is a low and essential tool that allows health to be maintained or even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, sand or installations to wash the hands at home, on the oil and on the workplace, it is difficult to reach universal habits of hygiene of hands.
For example, in the major part of rural Africa, it is rare to find robots to wash their hands near private or private toilet, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be imputable to tennis habits, rather than to a lack of sand or water.
The promotion of the lavage of hands in the satan and the conduct of employment activities in this regard can affect political decisions, make known the advantages related to this practice and lead to a long-term change in behaviour in the population.
In order to achieve this approach, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic examination of 70 studies showed that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand waste in low and intermediate income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the promotion campaigns of hygiene of hands that are conducted in order to reduce infantile diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Lavage of Hands is another example of the campaign of employment that is pre-predicted to promote the development of behaviour.After the 2019-2020 coronavir pandemy, the CEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating the lavage of hands.
A few studies have examined the global cost-efficiency report of hand waste in developing countries compared to the number of years of good health life (that is, DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the lavage of the hands to the saune is just more profitable than other water and raising interventions.
The importance of the lavage of hands for health hum·, particularly for persons in the situation of vulnerability such as mothers who had been listening to or injured in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of the hygiene of the hands: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British “the founder of modern careers”.
At that time, most of the people still believed that infections were two of the feti-smalls called myasms.
In the 1980s, food-original epidemies and nosocomial infections led American Centres to control and prevention of diseases to promote more actively the hygiene of hands as a essential means to prevent infection spread.
The appearance of the sweet influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemy in 2020 led to a greater conscience in many countries on the need to wash hands with soap to prejudice these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, the “good hand washing techniques ” were placed near towels and toilet toilet of office and airports.
The expression "laving their hands" refers to a person to assume the responsibility or to be compliant of something.
It is issued from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washed the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression was widespread in certain communities.
In Macbeth, of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash his hands in a compulsive way to try to clean a imaginary box, symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and that she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that, after remembering that they had committed acts contrary to ethical or intended to do it, some people have tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
Furthermore, those who are authorised to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclinated to grant other compensatory measures of purification, such as the volunteer.
Certain religions prescribe the lavage of hands for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic lavage of hands, which consists of using water and not satan to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of lavaging hands in many religions, including garism and hindouism, inmersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in the Christianism and wudhu in the islam. Religions also provide the lavage of hands for hygiene purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash his hands after he went to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jewishism and Islam requires to wash their hands before and after each food.
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace
COVID-19's risk controls on the workplace indicate the implementation of health and safety methods for the monitoring of risks in order to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk controls on the workplace varies from the job and tasks based on a assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to an infection by COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with less exposure risk have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only the measures to prevent infection-based prevention are recommended, including the lavage of hands, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label and the maintenance of a cleaning and the disabilities of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those needing frequent or close contacts with persons without a suspicioned or known COVID-19 but who can be infected because of a Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the large public, particularly in schools, high-depth work environments and some detailed environments.
The risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention measures, include a ventilation with highly efficient air filters, hygiene vitres and a individual protection equipment in case of meeting with a person reached by COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspicioned or known COVID-19 as a high risk of exposure, which is a very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or practices or manipulations of persons with a suspicioned or known COVID-19.
The risk controls suitable for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemies may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, need to care for others or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models can change both in respect of the goods requested and the means to buy them (including making their courses outside the hours of point or using delivery or drive service).
Finally, the sending of articles from serious geographical regions affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A preparation and response plan to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
Plans take account of risk levels associated with different jobs and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and Community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also seek the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may be presented after epidemies.
Preparation and response plans to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include the reduction of transmission among staff, the protection of persons with higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of adverse effects on other entities of their supply chain.
The severity of disease in the community where the company is affecting the applied responses.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a global framework used in health and work safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be removed, the most effective controls are technical controls, administrative controls and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees of the risks related to work without having to be based on the behavior of workers, which may constitute the most economic solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls designate changes in policies or procedures to work that require action from the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may contribute to prevent certain exhibitions.
All types of PI must be selected depending on the risk of the worker, correctly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), correctly and systematicly, regularly inspected, maintened and replaced, and correctly recovered, cleaned and stored or received to avoid any contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with less risk of exposure have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures for prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include the lavage of frequent and minute hands, the encouraging of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label, including covering the mouth and the nose to swimming and cut off, suppliing mosquito and powder, telework preparation or at the labour hours for the need, dissuading of workers to use tools and equipment of other people and to maintain cleaning and labour environment disinfection.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious people constitutes a crucial stage of protection of workers, customers, visitors and others on a workplace.
The United States Centers for the Monitoring and Prevention of diseases (CDCs) recommend employees with adequate respiratory disease symptoms to stay at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other medicines that act on the symptoms; they also recommend to apply flexible disease congestion policies, to allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and to inform the employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, median exposure employment includes those needing a common or heavy contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), of persons without a suspicioned or known COVID-19 but who can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to a Community transmission around the business seat or because the person has recently conducted a international trip into a region with an extensive transmission of the COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the large public, particularly in schools, high-depth work environments, and some high-volume detail environments. Technical controls for this group and higher risks include the installation of highly effective air filters, the replacement of the rate of ventilation, the installation of high-depth workshops such as hygiene hygiene vibrators and the installation of a client-service drive window. Administrative controls for this group and those higher risks include the promotion of ill workers to stay at home, replacement of meetings in persons with and financial communications, as well as for the financing of ecological worktimes, the financing of non-essential jobs for this group, and those in higher risks include the promotion of the promotion of illness workers to stay at home, replacement of the meetings with persons with persons and financing and financing for the efficiency, ensurance of financing and financing for the financing, financing and financing of financing of , , financing and financing of , , , financing of , financing , financing , , financing financing , , , financing , , , , , , , , , , , , financing , , , , , , , , , , , , financ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` ` ` , ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , ` ` ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , , ` , ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ` , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Workers of this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick at a plane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separate the disease from others by a distance of 6 feet, design a member of the team to take care of the sickness and offer a protective mask to the sick or ask him to cover the mouth and the nose with the help of the mouths when he is all or strange.
The cabin team must carry jetable pharmaceutical balls when it takes care of a sick passenger or affects organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the sick passenger presents the fever, a continuous tough or respiratory difficulties.
For commercial navigation, including crosses and other passenger battles, risk controls include the travel report in the case of disease and the auto-isolation and immediate information of the board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed on board.
Ideally, a pharmaceutical monitoring must be held in the cabin of the isolated person. For school institutions and children's guard, CDCs recommend a short-term closing for cleaning and disinfektion purposes if a infected person has become a school building, independent of the Community propagation.
In the case of a minimum to moderate Community transmission, social distance strategy can be implemented, such as the cancellation of pedagogical outputs, assemblies and other important races such as educational or choral courses or feeding at the cantine, by increaseing the space between offices, by decreasing the hours of harvest and output, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate treatment for children with grip symptoms.
In the case of a major transmission in the local community, including social distance strategy, an extension of school vacations can be considered. For the forces of the order performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered lower by CDCs.
The agents of the order forces to contact persons with suspicioned or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same directives as the ambulances, including the port of an appropriate individual protection equipment.
In the case of heavy contact during arrest, workers must clean and defect their equipment and service ticket before re-using with a linch or spray deterring and monitoring standard restriction and recovery procedures, as well as clothing and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and funeral workers as part of high or very high risks of exposure.
High exposure employment includes health, support, labor and medical transport workers exposed to patients with COVID-19 suspicioned or known.
They become very highly exposed workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or premiums or manipulation of patients with suspicioned or known COVID-19 samples.
The procedures produced by aerosols include inrubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain teeth examinations and procedures or the invasive samples.
The high-exposure employment includes workers involved in preparing people's body with COVID-19 suspicioned or known at their death; they are a very high risk of exposure if they practice autopsy; additional technical checks of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspicioned or known, including during the implementation of aerosol processes.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
The samples must be manipulated using biosecurity precautions at level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separation of patients entering in separate expectation rooms depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. Furthermore, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for those who work at less than 6 feet of patients with a suspicioned or known infection by SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol processes.
In the United States, NIOSH or above, respiratory masks of N95 filtering should be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection programme including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide higher protection and better comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the port of a chirurgical mask only by the input staff.
For those who collect respiratory samples, carry out or carry out COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a chirurgical mask, protection lamps or a face-train, a blow and wall.
In the case of aerosol production procedure, the chirurgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the world supply of EPI is insufficient, the WHO recommends to limit the need for EPI through telemedicin, barriers such as transparent windows, to limit access to a site occupied by a COVID-19 patients directly involved in its care, the use of EPIs necessary to the specific task only, the continuation of the same respiratory mask without recovering it for the support of several patients with the same Propertyc, the monitoring and the delay of the EPI supply chain and the disuse of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

EXPIRY DATE/Time : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICE : CC0 : No reserved rights
We are in a exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a demonstration of our global interconnection and our responsibility to each other.
Its challenges are unfair, but we know that our best answer is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and strengthening of the Community at the world level that is in the heart of this organization.
The companionship and well-being we have observed among all our students in the electronic courts, calls and constant conversations are a marvelous testimony of incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work with.
I couldn't be more proud and proud to count you all among my teams.
Last week, someone made me part of his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at present, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible through your work, that you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our communities or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
It is a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
As a result of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we are going to make the following adjustments of the way we work in it from the next week.
Adjustments of our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our time employment in days and months.
Think of this conversation, we have considered what would be an adjusted response to the situation in which we face and the best way to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
We had first to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All members of the staff, sub-traditional and contractual:
Our daily worktime goal will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to the new order.
We do not declare a frozen day: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful for the mission.
However, the world is imprisoned at this time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, make courses or consult a doctor, your welfare is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say it.
No illness stop or pay payment required: simply warn your superior and help your team to review the calendars and employment to ensure that the main work areas are covered.
(If you've been positive at COVID-19, you'll warn Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops to help T&amp;C and make sure your situation receives the necessary attention to the direction).
The time staff will be completely rewarded.
We have already announced it, and we will repeat our commitment to honor our responsibility to our sub-traditional and time staff members.
Everyone will be recompensed on the basis of its normal working hours under normal conditions.
This is worth if you are sick and incapable of working.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do may be incredible, especially in periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to keep you.
We simply ask you to deal with your superior, so we know what to wait and we can take the necessary provisions.
Certain tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Confidence & amp; Safety and Fund Collection (including) perform a essential work that might need strength.
We will initiate a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and to support the tasks for our mission.
There's enough work for each of us, we're just going to work on the most important projects.
Now relaxing will not hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to take away the lost time" when the pandemy is going to pass.
We will not ask you to do additional hours to respect now irrealistic periods.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new objectives, and to ensure that it is appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we are planning to adjust the need for delivery of our annual plan 2020-2012.
Our intention is to propose a plan of 2019-2020, which provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to work on the main work, to take care of them and their neighbors while adapting themselves to those who need or want to see their job time reduced in the next weeks.
This prolongation of the periods decreases the burden of work and the pressure of the current planning in the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps after confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our guards based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, by overtenance, we invited a antiviral cleaning team to defect all surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used an antiviral hospital quality solution to desinfect all surfaces, as well as the input hall and the ascensor boxes leading to our stage.
The building caused its own protocol to devote diligence that uses products to ensure the safety of its residents.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we will decide to come back.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, who shared with us and shared it with the members of the staff based on Washington DC with its COVID-19 protocol.
Since the last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration to San Francisco's advice.
As some of our guards found in New York know, we also discussed the idea of praising a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continued but could be updated.
Some of us are working remotely for the first time.
Our habitual work of remote work knows that adjustment may be difficult and wanted to give you some advice:
Decrease the time of meetings at meetings of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider to distribute them for several days.
Define the meeting, have a agenda and send the documentation forward.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom in order to promote direct and direct exchange.
Dispose of a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the continuous conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or to take collective notes).
Send a electronic court to the technical support if you need a comfortable cask.
Use your recovery well-being for employment.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your job distribution
The RH Operations Team studies genetic guidelines based on webinaries to support the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community subvention to have the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editors, until WHO announces the end of the pandemy.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to achieve their agreed subsidiary activities and that no one would be penalized in case of delay or change of these objectives.
The next week, we will have additional directives on Wikimania and other with thematic and regional Community references.
The general feeling of the international community is at the same time a triumph in the face of bulleting and lighting before clarity and the opportunity to address its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
For the purposes of this, the CRT works for the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space to ensure that the community can monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Keep in contact despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will benefit from this time to share other updates, answer your questions, and spending time in.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you anyway.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this electronic court, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19 on the Wiki Office.
The CRT will update these pages and raise all information at the same place.

b'The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external (cellular membranes) of the lung cells, arteries, hearts, renes and instincts.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin convert enzyme (ACE) reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increaseing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising medical target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronavirus.
The enzyme version hum’s enzyme is often designed under the name of hACE2.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing cinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a M2-peptidase-finishing area N and a renal amino acid-transporting area C.
The ACE2 is a single transition membrane protein of type I, with the active area at enzymatic level exposed on the surface of lung cells and other weights.
The extracellular area of the ACE2 is cut off from the transmembranary area by another enzyme called seddase; the solution protein that results is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is presented in most organs: ACE2 is primarily linked to cell membrane of the type II lung alveol cells, green intestin enterocytes, arterial and vineyard cells and arterial cells of muscle muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 ARNm is also presented in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalam and cerebral tro.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to ß the ACE.
The ACE climbs angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstructive.
The ACE2 turns to the carboxyle amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolysis in angiotensin vasodilatory (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also climb several other peptides, including [desArg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensine, dynorphine A, and greenine.
The ACE2 also regulates the membranary employment of the Aminous Acid Transporter SLC6A19 neutral and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As transmembran protein, the ACE2 is the main input point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SRAS virus) and SARS-CoV-2 (virus originating in COVID-19).
More precisely, the connection of the SRS-CoV and SARS-CoV protein to the enzymatic area of the ACE2 cell surface results in the endocytose and translocation both of the virus and enzyme into the endoses within the cells.
This input process also requires the starting of protein S by the host-serial protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this last is currently the subject of investigation as potential treatment. This leads to some to think that reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended to continue standard treatment with the ACE and ARB inhibitor.
A systematic review and meta-analyse on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with significant reduction of the risk of pneumonia compared to witness subjects. ”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated by ACE inhibitor with a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly HIV victims and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction of the mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were less evident than for the global risk of pneumonia. ”
The enzyme of conversion of angiotensin 2 recombinant hum® (rhACE2) is presence as an innovative treatment of severe lung lesions and → improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in porcelets with water respiratory disorder syndrome produced by lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the action duration is more than 30 minutes than the effect duration (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for persons who were tolerant to the classic renine-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRA) or for diseases with high angiotensin II angiotensine. RhACE2 was assessed in the framework of clinical tests for the treatment of the water respiratory disorder syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the coronavir pandemy 2019-20, namely identifying people ("contacts") which may be in contact with a infected person.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territory and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been set up for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, particularly those based on the trace of the geografic location of application users, arise issues regarding privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the neighborhood of a user with other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced the direct integration in their android and iOS operational systems to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, with Alipay, developed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with COVID-19 portfolio people.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
It was developed by a local community of informators, which was provided in open source and will be delivered to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StartKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures the trace of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly with health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was expected to approve by the Google Play Store and App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the application of contact trace was advanced and could be developed during the next weeks.
Australia and New Zealand intend to establish applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geoperation application for patients with a COVID-19 and resistance in Moscou to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambria, stressed several possible practical problems relating to the use of application-based systems, including false positive and lack of potential efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to anxieties regarding the propagation of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only provides "official" or generally worthy of confidence to acquire applications related to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Soldiers for the protection of private life have been part of their concerns regarding the implications of coronavirus applications in mass monitoring, in particular the possible demantalation of the supervisory infrastructure created to face the coronavir pandemy once the distant threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have made a statement to limit this type of monitoring.
These organizations have established eight conditions to be complied with Government projects:
monitoring should be "necessary, necessary and proportional" ;
Control and monitoring should be conducted by extinction clauses ;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data safety and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable way;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation should be avoided;
any share of data with third parties should be defined in the law ;
Protection against abuse and complaints for citizens should be provided in case of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all interested parties would be obligatory, including those of health experts and marginalised groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Non-Limited Reporters (Reporter Without Border) (RSF) in Germany also have checking lists.
The plan proposed by Google/©e aims to attack the problem of sustainable monitoring by eliminating the tracking mechanism of the exploitation system of their devices as soon as it is necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to brutal geolocation data have significant potential problems in respect of private life.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created in order to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows private life to be respected (see section Next).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a given application, the system collected trace information to various sources, including the data on tracking of mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of these information to warn potential contacts, the Government also provided the public accessible location information, which was authorised by the deep changes made to the confidentiality law of information after the MERS epidemic that touched this country.
These information are accessible to the public through several websites and applications, such as Germany, which have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve private life.
The details have not been made on 6 April 2020.
The trace of contacts respecting private life is a well established concept, which has been set by a large volume of research data since 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than 12 expert groups worked on solutions respecting private life, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the neighborhood of a user with other mobile phones.
However, projectPP-PT is an effort to associate centralised and decentralised approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), inter alia.
These protocols enables to ensure that the identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all correspondences are affected on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab currently develops SafePaths, a platform for use of private life preservation techniques in collection and use of localisation or contact data to follow the development of COVID-19.
This technology is based on the results of the white book Apps Gone Rogue: ↓taining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, an entity developing the protection of private life initially based on MIT Media Lab, is a similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe materials to allow users to share sensitive localisation and health data with other users and authorities, without compromise their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International CNS coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and principle equivalent protocols to reduce the fragmentation and to ensure the global interoperability of trace and warning applications, a essential factor of their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, who control the android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to trace contacts, stateing that it would enable private life and associate Bluetooth Low Energy and a cryptography to ensure confidentiality.
They also have made the specifications of the baselines used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be developed in three phases:
Deployment of tools allowing governments to create official applications for the trace of coronavirus respecting the privacy
Direct integration of this function in iOS and Android. Google and Apple provides to solve the problems of adoption of the solution and sustainable monitoring by distributing the system initially through updates of the operational system and submitting it later on the same occasion as the distant threat.
The replacement of a medicine (a.k.a. reorientation, reprofilation, reaffectation or therapeutic change of a medicinal product) indicates the recovery of a medicinal product approved for a disease or a different pharmaceutical affection than that for which it was initially developed.
It is a scientific research axis currently studied to develop safe and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of convalent persons. SARS-CoV-2 presents approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of them with several linking sites.
The analysis of these link sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral medicine against proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the protease of the papaine type, the dependent RNA polymerase RNA, the helicase, the S protein and the ADP ribose phosphatase are found.
Hussein A, and al. have studied several candidate components which have then optimized and analysed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved medicines in order to accelerate the development of a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinic study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chlorokine is also an antipaludeen medicine used against certain self-immunal diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorokine and apparent hydrochlorokine would be part of the four medicines studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Chomme, announced that the tests of the New York State on chlorokine and hydrochlorokine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorised the use of hydrochlorokine and chlorokine phosphate by authorisation of emergency use (USA).
The treatment was not approved by the clinical test process of the FDA and is only authorised by the EU as a experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but not able to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that the use, dose or duration of hydroxychlorokine for prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection is not yet established.
The doctors indicated that this medicine was used “if there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chlorokine in ↓ with zinc, vitamine A, vitamine C and vitamine D.
Greatest studies are being studied at Duke University and University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone Medical School tests on the safety and efficiency of the prevention of hydroxichlorokine use.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "increasingly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in a average of 4 days while the illness duration was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan of 240 patients suffering of pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half of umifenovir.

On 2 April, Germany announced that she would buy the medicine in Japan for her reservations and use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened opportunities for Trump administration to gain the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be sure for women who are zealous or who are trying to create.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These medicines have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by connecting to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado attempts to find these medicines to find a composite that would be related to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are critics in the scientific community regarding the use of resources for the replacement of medicines specially provided for HIV/SIDA.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and viral infections of Marburg. Gilead Sciences then discovered that the remdesivir had an in vitro antiviral activity against several filovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistence through mutations that can cause a severe disease and transmission.
Some recent studies before the test suggest that the remdesivir may have a high genetic barry against resistance. Several clinical trials are current, among which two were conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on people suffering from a moderate pathology and the other on more severe forms.
There are three clinical tests on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely sick from COVID-19; two controlled placebo (Chine and Canada) and one without control (Italia).

The low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which stimulates the Italian medicines to provide guidelines on use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventional and therapeutic doses was studied in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have been addressed to the reposition of approved antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous epidemies such as MERS, SRAS and Western Nil virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19日 at the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19日 at the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially resistable as treatments of COVID-19:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many development attempts are current.
End February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, virus from the origin of the disease before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were studying phase I security.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been stated throughout the world in 2020, providing important investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the implicits of the CEPI initiative for vaccination are the speed, production capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different platforms were conducting research and development projects starting in 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform past in phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (fase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (fase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 addenoviral vector
As stated by the CEPI scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are in the first stages of development of which 78 (79 of the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other years, but with little information available (summit in planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenic tests, usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres, determining more effective doses.
Phase III tests usually include more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of vaccine in the prevention of disease, while monitoring the adverse effects on the optimal dose.
Among the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed early April 2020), 74 have not yet been in an evaluation phase on the human person (always in preclinic research).

In March 2020, the US government, the industry and three universities joined their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with computer resources on the sky of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have hetherogenic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they predict.
Another randomized test provides for 4 170 health professionals.
The current development vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficiency of a vaccine using specific animal models for the COVID-19, such as ACE-2 transgenic mouse, other laboratorial animals, non-human primates, indicates the need for implementing biosecurity restrictions to live virus manipulation, and a international halt to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vacuums against SRAS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no sanitary or protective vaccine against SRAS that has demonstrated its safety and efficiency in humans.
According to research documents made in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for the governments and health agencies of the world.No vaccine is tested against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SRAS research could be used as a model to develop vaccines and medicines against a MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one single vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three other; all vaccines were at viral vector, two addenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one at MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks spread a theory of the complot that the virus from origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social network publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus sockets such as SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acue respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Correct symptoms include fever, tough and drunkenness.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle pain, diarrhea, gorge pain, go loss and abdominal pain.
The time between the exposure and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can coscile between two and fourteen days.
While most of the cases produce moderate symptoms, some develop to a viral pneumonia and a deficiency of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide, which were born more than 153.000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been healed. The virus is mainly spread in close contact, often by guittellets produced by tossing, internally or by speaking.
As they are produced by expiration, they are generally falling into the ground or on surfaces rather than representing a infectious risk on long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then by touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth.
The virus may survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days after the symptoms appear, although the county is possible before the symptoms appear and during the later phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the inverse transcription of the reaction in polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their patients.
Recommendations on the port by the public are generally different, certain authorities refusing their use, others recommending their use, and others still imposing their use.
There is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 currently.
The local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of the WHO.
Persons infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or develop influenza symptoms such as fever, tough, weakness, slaughter.
The symptoms of emergency include difficulties to breathe, pain or persistent toracic pressure, confusion, difficulties to walk and a face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Less often, higher respiratory symptoms such as eternal, narrow equation, or crack can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a toracic pressure and palpitations.
In some, sickness may cause pneumonia, deficiency of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do it within 11.5 days after infection, and reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic porters in the transmission is not yet fully known, however, preliminar elements suggest that they can contribute to the propagation of disease.
The proportion of infected persons who have no symptoms is currently unknown to the study. The Korean Centers of Prevention and Control of diseases (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalisation.
The Chinese National Health Committee began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectation and saliva can both transport important viral burdens.
The fact that speaking strongly frees more guittellets than normally speaking.
A study in Singapore revealed that without protecting it can design gouttelets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transported by air, national science academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors placed outside the patients' rooms produced positive samples for virus RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) can spread respiratory secretions and thus lead to air propagation.
Although there are anxieties about propagation by cells, this risk is considered weak. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation can be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of diseases (ECDC) states that if you do not know exactly with what facility the disease is spread, a person generally contains two to three others. The virus survives even hours or days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on the carton, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on the cow of 99 %.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
São and detergents are also effective if properly used; sain-based products degradate the protective lipid bed of the virus, which disables it and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate of chlorhexidine (a chirurgical deinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in average two days after the start of the hospitalisation.
In five of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral burden, while in the sixth patient the highest viral burden was on the second tested day.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acid respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acid respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia associated with Wuhan water respiratory disease home.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the coronavirus appearing in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the householder, who breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the SARS-CoV.
The pulmons are the most touched organs of COVID-19 because the virus accesss to host cells through the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the alveolary cells of type II of lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "specular" (peplomer) to connect to ACE 2 and penetrate into the host cell.
Aguay heart lesions have been reported at 12% of the people admitted to the Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms are high because of the systemic flexible response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, however, the acid myocard lesions can also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The recipients of ACE 2 are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
High thrombosis (31%) and venous tromboembolic disease (25%) have been observed in patients with intensive care units of COVID-19 infections and can be associated with a defavorable pronostic. COVID-19 mortal person autopsies have shown different alveolary damage (DAD) and flexible infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the pulmon.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for the epiphelial cells of respiratory paths expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
These are particularly the GM-CSF secretary T cells associated with the recycling of fluctuating monocytes secreting IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytary infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO has made several test protocols for disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse transcription of the reaction by polymerase in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by primarily rhinopharynged; however, a pre-natal or expectation can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, even until two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however, they require two blood pryers taken at two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a suck of coronavirus and have made the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop independently tests of polymerisation reaction (PCR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, anticorps tests (seeable to determine active infections and a person’s previous infection) were in developing, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience showed a precision of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first nearest test of the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month.
Multi-lobber bilateral depoly opacities with periferic, asymmetric and later distribution are typical symptoms at the beginning of the infection.
Domination under pleural, crazy paving (interlobulary seats with variable alveolary complication) and consolidation can occur with the progress of the disease.
No data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological detections of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: plural, pericardite, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonies can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edemy, pneumocytrary hyperplase, atypic pneumocytes isus, interstitial inflammation with lymfocytary infiltration and formation of multinucléated genetic cells
Severe pneumonia: diffus alveolary damage (DAD) with diffusal alveolary exhausts.
DAD is the cause of water respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
pneumonia in the course of the treatment: organisation of exhausteds in alveolary cavites and interstitial lung fibrose
Sang: diseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD) ; leuco-erythroblastic reaction
The preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying in themselves, avoiding bonded places, often washing hands in water and sand for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth with the unslaved hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and the nose with a mouth when it goes up or outside and uses the cow inside in the absent of mouth.
A correct hygiene of the hands is recommended after he has cut off or stretched.
The CDC recommended to cover the face with a weight in public places to limit transmission in cases of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategy aims to reduce contacts of people infected with large groups by shutting schools and jobs, reducing movements and cancelling the major groups of people.
Distance Directives also include respect for a 6-foot minimum distance (1.8 m) between persons.
There are no medicines known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine was not expected before 2021 to earlier, a key element of the COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic pic, which is also called "approximate the corbe".
The CDC also recommends individuals to wash their hands often in the sand and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been at the toilet or when the hands are soiled; before eating; and after being mossed, cut off, or exploded.
In addition, it recommends to use a defective solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and sand are not available. For areas where deinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO offers two forms for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobian activity comes from etha or isopropanol.
Hydroxine peroxide is used to eliminate theterinal spores in alcohol, not “a active substance for hands”.
Glycerol is used as humid.
Persons are treated by support care that may include hydrological treatment, oxygenotherapy and other affected animal organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspicious of being a virus have a simple face mask.
Extra-corporal oxidation by membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a way of life and healthy food were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have moderate symptoms in the previous stage of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Committee have made recommendations for hospitalized people's care for COVID-19.
Reanimatory and pneuologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) rather than ibuprofene in the first line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, especially under care conditions when the implementation of procedures can generate aerosols, such as inbution or manual ventilation.
For health professionals suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an isolation room adapted to airway infection (AIRI) in addition to use standard precautions, contact precautions and cares relating to air transport. The CDC stresses the directives on the use of individual protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemy.
The recommended equipment is: blue PPE, respiratory or face mask, eye protection and medical tanks. If available, respiratory masks are privileged (in face masks).
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has allowed the use of these masks in accordance with Urgency Usage Authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particulates such as dust, but their efficiency against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-specific uses.
When the masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use facial protection screens, or in the last resource, artisanal masks.
The majority of the cases of COVID-19 are not sufficiently difficult to need mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases.
The type of respiratory assistance for people who suffer from breathing failure associated with COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that inbution can be avoided by using a high-depth nasal channel or a positive pressure of double-level respiratory roads.
We are ignored whether one of the two or both are born the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technology limits the distribution of aerosol particulates compared to a high-rate nausea. Severe cases are more frequent in adults (over 60 years, especially over 80).
Many developed countries have not enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of care system to deal with a little bit of the number of cases of COVID-19 quite serious to need hospitalisation.
A China study showed that 5% of the cases were granted in intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% were killed.
In China, approximately 30% of hospitalized people with COVID-19 are finally allowed in intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of the water respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxidation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering high pressure control modes and high EP are necessary to optimize oxygen release and minimise the risk of lung lesion associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High EEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
Search for potential treatments starting in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are subject to clinical tests.
The remdesivir is the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several in the course of test medicines are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in patients suffering from severe disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in tests on the efficiency and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalents as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It was not subject to clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficiency for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage epidemia.
Users are requested to enter their name and identification.
The application is able to detect "nearcome contacts" using monitoring data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user may also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application is not only recommended by the autoquarters, it also warns local health authorities. The analysis of the massive data on mobile phone data, face-freeness, mobile phone location and artificial intellectuality is used to locate infected people and those with whom they have been contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people who were suspicious of having coronavirus.
The measure aimed at respecting the 40% and protecting people who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregated phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the propagation of virus.
Russia has developed face-effectiveness in order to identify people who do not respect the Quarant.
In Italy, the Regional Ministry of Health Giulio Gallera stated that mobile telephone operators were informed that "40% of people continue to move."
The German Government held a 48-hour hakathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
The Estonian President, Kersti Kaljulaid, has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the propagation of the coronavirus.
Persons may suffer from 40%, movement restrictions, secondary effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor declarant, “ground social isolation, singleness, health care, stress and economic resistance are a perfect cocktail to hurt mental health and people’s welfare”.
Sickness may have moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as the reume.
Moderate cases are generally recovered in two weeks, while serious or critical cases need three to six weeks.
In some cases, COVID-19 may affect poultry and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely touched cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress to develop to a water respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) caused respiratory failure, sectical shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sexicemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, particularly an increase in prothrombine time, have been described at 6 per cent of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, as a renal insufficiency is observed at 4 per cent of those in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of COVID-19 persons have high hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, including five passed in hospitalisation.
However, intensive care-transfered patients had a average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of the previous cases, the average duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach comprised between six and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Committee (NHC), men had a rate of mortality of 2.8% while women had a rate of mortality of 1.7%.
The hystothological examinations of post-mortem lung samples have a diffused alveolary damage with fibromyxoid cell exhausts in both lungs.
Viral cytopatic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the powder is to a water respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chine National Health Committee, heart lesions due to high rate of tropone or to a cardiac delay have been observed.
According to march data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies; the ability of medical resources and the socioeconomic conditions of a region may also have a impact on mortality.
The estimates of the rate of mortality of the disease varied because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Subnumbering moderate cases may result in a over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that death is the result of contracted cases may indicate that the current rate of mortality is under estimation.
The smokers were 1,4 times more inclinated to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a 2.5 times higher risk of getting into intensive care or death in comparison to non-fumers.
Hong Kong’s hospital administration observed a fall of 20% to 30% of the respiratory capacity in some healthy people, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to an intensive post care syndrome after treatment.
In March 2020, it was ignored whether a previous infection was a long-term immunity in the health careers.
Immunity is considered to be found on the basis of the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases of healthy persons from COVID-19 followed by positive coronavir tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered as an increase in a late infection rather than as a reinfection.
We think the virus is natural and animal origin by propagation of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the propagation of the infection was almost only conducted by a human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in January 2020 in The Lancet showed that the oldest date of the symptoms appeared on 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO indicated the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are usually used to evaluate mortality.
These numbers are different from the regions and in time, and are affected by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, therapeutic options, time expired since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health.
Finally, 2019, the WHO affected the CIM-10 U07.1 pathological emergency codes for the deaths confirmed in the laboratory of the infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the deaths of COVID-19 resulted from a clinical or epidemiological view without infection in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratorium. The death/case report reflects the number of deaths differed by the number of cases in a given period of time.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the dead/World Case report is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the letality rate (CFR) reflecting the percentage of individuals declining from illness and the rate of infectional letality (IRF) that reflect the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who decline from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although all infected people do not develop anticorps, the presence of anticorps may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicter of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglione of Adda, a small village of 4 600 residents, 80 of them (1.7%) have already been killed.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through festivals, and to young people who were born a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overcome.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as associated with COVID-19.
The impact of pandemy and the rate of mortality are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is in fifty-year-old men, the difference between men and women that are only 90 years old.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The precise reasons for this difference between sex are unknown, but genetic and behavior factors can be part of it.
Immunological differences are sex, the lower prevalence of tobacco in women and development in men of comerbidities such as hypertension at a less advanced age than women could have contributed to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected people were men and 72 per cent of the mortal persons of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US Government does not collect data associated with the type of infections with COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS are differently affecting men and women.
A higher percentage of health staff, particularly the personal, are women and have a higher risk of being exposed to virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means coron, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 is the first identification of epidemia: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical place (e.g. China), a species of animals or a group of persons, to international nomenclature recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatisation. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acue respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called coronavirus.
The initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended to use the 2019-nCov provisional names of disease and water respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in the Directive of 2015 against the use of sites in the names of diseases and virus.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were held on 11 February 2020.
Taking into account the ability limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care material such as cocktails and respiratory pieces.
For example, when a Italian hospital needed a wall of respirator in emergency and that the supplier could not provide it in a desired time, a local startup restored and printed the 100 waves required in one night.
Following the initial epidemic of COVID-19, complexist theories, false information and discovery have been issued on the origin, extension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and have rapidly spread online.
It is that man is able to spread disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been found for viral replication evidence in porcs, canards and pockets.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched “SOLIDARITY test” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compositions with the most promising efficiency.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous travels on the SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 recipient to pass into humide cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to research.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such virus, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid human body immune response in case of new infection to COVID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that enhances the immune system for certain virus sub- units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies are held on S-specular protein that helps the virus to infiltrate in the enzyme receptor of ACE 2.
A third strategy is the vaccines based on nuclear acids (see DNA or RNA, a new vaccination technique).
Experiencing vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensif genetic code copied on the virus that causes disease. The dependent activation of anticorps was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversed.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are current.
Seven tests have evaluated already approved treatments against paludism, including four studies on hydroxychlorokine or chlorokine.
Reconverted antiviral medicines constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials of Phase III on remdesivir in several countries with the reports expected in April.
A dynamic clinical analysis of vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 was also located in April 2020. Several antiviral medicines are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorokine and hydrochlorokine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Temporary data suggest the efficiency of remdesivir in March 2020.
clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdezivir with compassionate use.
In the United States, China and Italy, clinical trials of Phase III are being studied. The chlorokine, used earlier to treat the paludism, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminar results.
However, some request an independent analysis of research.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chlorokine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and may be mortal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychlorokin and chlorokine in accordance with the authorisation of emergency use for medical discrimination with COVID-19 patients. The 7th issue of Chinese directives includes also interferon, ribavirin or umifenevir against COVID-19.
Preliminar data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the follow-up of an in vivo study after showing a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that the initial spike protein starting with the serial transmembran protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the input of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE recipient 2.
Studies on chlorokine and hydrochlorokine with or without azitromycine have major limits that prevented the medical community to adopt these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic choc may be a complication at later stages of COVID-19.
There are evidence that hydroxychlorokine may have cytokinic antichoc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment directives by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study.
Fase 2 tests are not randomized at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people who have a severe form of disease.
Associated with a series of ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic choc, it must be contrary to such evolutions that are suspicious of the death of some touched people.
The antagonist of the interleukine-6 recipient was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the symptoms of refractional cytokines to steroids induced by a different cause, the treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
Today, no random and controlled evidence indicates that tocilizumab is a effective treatment of the SCR.
Transfer of anticorps produced by the immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to those who need it is the study as a non- vaccinal method of passive immunisation.
This strategy has been tested for the SRAS with few conclusions.
Viral neutralization is the expected method of action through which anticorps-based treatment can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity depending on antibodies and/or phagocytose can be possible.
Other forms of antibiotic treatment, such as using monoclonal anticorps manufactured, are developing.
The production of serum of convalents, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients with specific anticorps against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a closely apparent syndrome group
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the central hospital of Wuhan, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after taking attention to the spread of the virus.
