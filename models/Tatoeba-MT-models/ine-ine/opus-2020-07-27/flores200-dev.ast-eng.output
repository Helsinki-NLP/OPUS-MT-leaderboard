This makes the pattern turn, if the patterns are inclined to the man, the pattern will draw to the man, if they do it to the ear, the pattern turns to the ears.
To return to your previous energy level, they must be disabled from the extra energy they got out of the light.
This is doing emitting a small piece of light that is called "foto".
Scientists lamen this "stimated radiation emission" process because the atomes are simulated with strong light, which causes the emission of a light photo, and the light is a kind of radiation.
The next illustration shows how the atomics emit photons. From then on, the photons are actually much smaller than those of the drawing.
The photons are still smaller than the material that the atomes are closed!
